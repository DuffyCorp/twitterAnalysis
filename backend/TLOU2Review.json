Last Of Us- Part 2; An interpretation.\nLast Of Us 2 has been an incredibly divisive game. Some loved it and some hated it. I am in the former category. To me, it is the greatest PS4 exclusive, tied with God Of War(two extremely incomparable games). Seeing many negative reviews all around the internet, I felt like I should voice my thoughts too.\nI am completely neglecting the negative reviews because of the homophobia and misogyny, because any time spent entertaining those thoughts(including typing out this sentence) is a waste of my time.\nAnd I guess I don’t need to speak about the gameplay, graphics and the horror(gameplay horror) of the game, coz that is almost unanimously agreed as stellar.\nThe main criticism about the story was that it was ‘pointless’, and ‘unnecessary’ in many players’ eyes. I read many people saying, the story was ‘all for nothing’ at the end, when she forgave Abby. Some loved what happened, and some hated it.\nWe must begin by asking ourselves the question- “What is the story of The Last Of Us 2”\nIf the answer is- “When Joel was brutally murdered by members of an organisation, led by Abby, in front of the eyes of Ellie, she seeks vengeance and to rain down agony on everyone responsible”, I think you got the answer wrong. That, I believe, is the plot of the game, not the story. And that is where, this transcends to above anything we have ever seen in this industry.\nLet’s take Last Of Us(1). The plot is- “following and outbreak that rendered much of the population top be zombie like creatures, the protagonist Joel, must take an apparently immune child, to an organisation to develop a vaccine for the disease”. But what was the story that you took, away? It was about a father, trying desperately to right a wrong from his past. Ask any parent, and it is very likely that they consider “protecting their child” to be the most important duty in their life. Joel would've been no different either. But he failed very early, when his beautiful daughter, Sarah, died in his arms, terrified and defenceless. He is a hardened man weighed down by this pain. When he travelled across the country taking care of this little, foul mouthed girl, deep inside, he was in some ways seeing his own daughter there. When he first thought she was in danger, he ignored the excruciating pain he was under and rushed to save her. And when it meant that potentially saving the world would mean, letting her die, he could not go through with it. He failed his daughter once, but he cannot do it again.\nLast Of Us Part 2, has a similar tale to it. On the surface, it seems that Ellie is driven by the anger towards Abby and the rest of the WLF crew. Her fuel was the raging vengeance, one might think. But I think the flashback scenes prove that it was different. She was driven by anger, surely, but it was not towards Abby and WLF. It was towards Ellie herself. Just like Joel felt like he failed Sarah in Part 1, Ellie feels that she failed Joel, when she was not there to save him. Or worse, she feels that Joel died thinking that Ellie hated him. For taking away the meaning of her life. Deep inside, even she knew that she meant a lot to the man and she meant a lot to her. Enough for a lifetime. Her journey through the game, was her over circles of hell, that she put herself through.\nThen we have Abby. A girl who saw hope for a second, when everything was taken away from her by a mad man. She has not known peace since then. Her nightmares were filled with those memories and she had no escape. When she finally found him, she unleashed all her anger on to him, hoping for an escape. But she did not find it. Until, she tried to make more of her life. By fighting with everything she got, trying to save a boy and girl, whom she was trained to kill. It is there, that she was close to finding peace. But again, it was shattered when this girl came out of nowhere and killed almost everyone dear to her. But this time, she chose forgiveness, because she knew that therein lies true freedom.\nWith this, we reach the final act, where we find these two incredibly complex characters, battling it all out. This is where Ellie REALLY sees herself, Abby and Lev. The woman dying Ellie’s clutches was none other than Joel himself and the little boy dying in the boat, was Ellie herself. This crushing realisation pulled back Ellie to stop this chain of hate.\nIn the epilogue of the story, we see a final memory of Ellie and Joel trying to mend the broken relationship. Was it a real memory, or an imagination by Ellie? Her wish to believe that he knew, that whatever happened, she could never hate Joel? That he will always be like a father to her? Whatever it was, that brought peace to Ellie.\nThis is what I take back from the story. If this interpretation intrigues you in anyway(lovers and haters of the game), please do try to play it again. See if it means more to you, this time around.… Expand\n-\n-\nJun 19, 2020All it takes is a little push for Ellie to go mad and her quest for revenge story is a brutalistic masterpiece.

            "text": "The Last of Us is one of the rare beloved games of the past decade that not only didn’t demand a sequel, but actively seemed to resist the idea of one. Its story is largely poignant because of how self-contained it is: not knowing what happened between Joel and Ellie after his fateful, final decision burned a mark into the brains of many who played it, and that open-ended question has lingered for years. But with The Last of Us Part 2, developer Naughty Dog rises to that challenge with not only a complex, profound story that gives it a reason to exist, but also deep and satisfying evolutions to the original’s third-person action/stealth gameplay.I can’t tell you much about some of Part 2’s best aspects, but not because I don’t want to – I’m bursting to talk with anyone about all the moving, uplifting, and heart-wrenching moments that have been replaying in my mind for days since I first beat this adventure. But doing so would strip away layers of the act of playing through Part 2 yourself, so I’ll speak about its story in largely general terms.\nOne of Part 2’s biggest achievements is how it knowingly handles the weighted expectations that a sequel to one of the most heralded game stories of all time will inevitably carry with fans. It starts out seemingly simple, taking place about four years after the end of the original and setting an older, angrier, but still-immune Ellie on a quest for revenge that also hones in on the cycles of violence that can plague humanity as much as any infection. It knowingly leans into the tropes of the genre, such as guilt by association and the inevitable escalation of matching an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth. But those cliches are often subverted, playing into the expansive and not-so-straightforward path ahead.\nEllie’s journey grows into something much more ambitious.From there, Ellie’s journey grows into something much more ambitious. Part 2 deftly handles a war on the streets of post-zombie-apocalypse Seattle, an expansive new cast of characters, and some gut-punch payoffs to the lingering emotions The Last of Us’ powerful ending left me stirring over for the last seven years. The Last of Us Part 2’s story is handled as masterfully as it was in the original.\n“\n“\nOne of the most impactful ways Part 2 hearkens back to The Last of Us is how it asks you to identify and empathize with its characters, even when you almost certainly won’t always agree with their actions. In a medium often defined by giving us the power to choose what happens, The Last of Us and Part 2 concern themselves more with fully realized characters, asking us to take them as they are. Naughty Dog’s characters are indelible, which makes for incredibly powerful and challenging moments when you’re put in Ellie's shoes and asked to act out her whims yourself.Part 2 is peppered with brutal, tragic, and poignant moments that hit harder because you take part in them, like it or not. Even if I disagreed with an action, I didn’t have a choice in the matter. I was asked to execute those actions or watch them happen without a chance to intercede, and to understand the reasoning behind them from their perspective. This dance between interactivity and an unalterable story made for a much more affecting experience than if I’d watched it all unfold in a movie.\nI Am Not Alone, Dear LonelinessAt the heart of it all is Ellie and her relationships. Ellie has had time to both find herself in the Jackson, Wyoming settlement she and her flawed father figure Joel call home and to reflect on the formative moments of her childhood. Uncovering what she knows and where she stands with Joel and his brother Tommy, is, at different times painful, amusing, and cathartic, but always in ways that are true to what I knew of these characters.\nActors Troy Baker and Ashley Johnson once again bring so much heart and honesty in their performances as Joel and Ellie, respectively. Ellie is, without a doubt, the protagonist of Part 2, and Johnson brings nuance to every facet of Ellie’s character. Watching her grow up and wrestle with her past while still learning who she is as a 19-year-old (with all the usual desires and shortfalls 19-year-olds generally possess) is riveting at every step. She delivers some of the most human moments that Part 2 serves up.Baker is no less fantastic as Joel, even though Ellie is in the more prominent playable role. However you may feel about Joel’s decisions in the original, Baker sells the weariness of a man who has taken many lives to save his own and made questionable moral decisions out of love. Seeing him reckon with a surrogate daughter who both cares for him and yet keeps him at arm’s length is devastating to watch. Taking a cue from 2014’s prequel expansion, The Last of Us: Left Behind, Part 2 allowed me to live in moments between Joel and Ellie, which offered up a quiet reflection of why they view the world they do.\nEven when she does horrible things, her motivations are just as legitimate as Joel's or Ellie's.Part 2 also introduces a great cast of supporting characters. Shannon Woodward is instantly charming as Dina, bringing a joy and kindness to a world where it’s otherwise so tough to find. Woodward shines in the smaller moments — a joking jab at Ellie here or an amusing aside about their Jackson homestead, there — offering so much dimension to the character. It’s also important to highlight, in spoiler-free terms, the incredible performance by Laura Bailey (known for her roles as Mary Jane from Marvel’s Spider-Man and Kait Diaz from Gears 5, among numerous others) as a new character. Like so many of The Last of Us’ characters, calling her good or evil would be reductive – we see her at her best and most relatable as well as her worst. It’s a testament to The Last of Us Part 2’s script by Neil Druckmann and Halley Gross and Bailey’s performance that even when she does horrible things, her motivations are just as legitimate and arguably noble as Joel’s or Ellie’s.\n“\n“\nIt takes a deft hand to write characters like this; those I wanted the best for even if they were doing despicable things. Some of the choices the characters made in Part 2 delighted me, others frustrated me, but I always wanted them to be better, and stronger, and see the goodness in themselves. In this regard, they felt incredibly human.The way Naughty Dog uses the larger, community-based conflict between the warring groups in Seattle also helped avoid the fatigue that set in with the latter acts of Uncharted 4. Even though it took me about 25 hours to complete (10 hours longer than the original), Part 2 never dragged or felt padded out thanks to the large cast and Naughty Dog’s efforts to give each of them the screen time and story arc they deserve. Bringing so many perspectives to the forefront beautifully illustrates the larger ideas and conflicts in this world.\nI Would Like to RageThose conflicts play out with some very familiar stealth, action, and puzzle sequences. That said, one of the biggest critiques of the first game is that its combat and puzzle segments weren’t deep enough to avoid repetition over its 15 hours, and Part 2 has taken major steps to remedy that and add variety to gameplay – some of which seem obvious in hindsight. For example, it’s silly to think that adding a jump button in 2020 could feel so fresh, but it most definitely proves to be key to Part 2’s many enthralling combat encounters. Ellie is far more nimble than Joel, able to jump, swing, and climb over and under things to more carefully avoid or stalk enemies. That not only made my options feel exponentially more varied, but also allowed the level design around these encounters to be more open and diverse at every step.\nFrom underground caverns to dilapidated office and apartment buildings to the lush, overgrown streets of a Seattle being reclaimed by nature, Part 2’s stealth combat is easy to understand but consistently exciting to try and master with every new fight. Part of that comes from the scope of its battlefields: they take place in areas like multi-tiered shopping malls or fragmented skyscrapers that offer what feel like naturally complex puzzle boxes. There was always plenty of room, both literally and mechanically, to sneak around and pick off enemies one by one, go in guns blazing, or (as usually happened for me) plan to be stealthy but get caught and scramble to narrowly escape danger.\nEllie’s ability to jump, go prone, dodge, and even run away from combat not only takes advantage of these large spaces, but also enables that improvisation within them, pushing you to adapt to any situation or meet a quick death. Enemies don’t just stick to set patterns; they’re reactive to the environment around them.While giving every human enemy a name and the ability to communicate with each other more effectively while searching for you seems somewhat superfluous at first, the practical application of it was always clear after I’d killed an enemy or two in any given fight. The Washington Liberation Front enemies, seeing a friend or loved one dead on the ground, would immediately switch up their search pattern, taking note of recently downed enemies and possible escape routes the killer could have taken from that spot. Simply hearing my enemies verbally work through their plans, rather than just going about their patrol routes, instilled so much more tension into every fight.\nLearning the ins and outs of each faction added another interesting layer to combat.Then there are the differences between the factions – learning the ins and outs of each added another interesting layer to combat. The Seraphites, battling with bows and arrows, use a whistling system to communicate, while the WLF members are more vocal and transparent, but carry a lot more firepower.\n“\n“\nAnd the Infected… well, they haven’t suddenly started talking, but their mob mentality is more threatening than ever. New enemies like the Shambler throw noxious spore bombs that cut off potential escape routes or obscure other enemies. The returning but more prevalent Stalkers are even scarier than before, pulling off a move Drax would be jealous of by making themselves invisible to Ellie’s returning radar-like Listen ability. They’ll use that silence to sneak up behind you, and when one attacks, it often means more are on the way. Fights with them, and a mixture of the many other Infected enemies with different abilities to take into account, led to several encounters that rivaled the best survival-horror experiences out there.This is all to say enemies feel vastly more intelligent and varied in this sequel, and the little details make all the difference in combat: when alerted, enemies will check every inch of a map, including under cars and around each bit of cover, and their increased responsiveness to changes in the environment meant I could rarely sit still or rely on just one weapon. I loved that incentive to not only shake up my strategy but also become more familiar with any given area as quickly as possible.\nI sometimes found myself choosing to be stealthy and non-lethal just to save myself from watching a brutal blow.And yes, despite all of the added nuance, Part 2 has some of the most bluntly brutal combat animations I’ve seen in any game, and it’s never played to a cartoonish degree the way something like Mortal Kombat does. It fits thematically with the tone, Ellie’s revenge-minded focus, and the violence those in power will use to control this post-pandemic society, but that doesn’t make the impact any less gruesome, and occasionally hard to stomach. The most frequent kill I witnessed was Ellie’s stealth takedown: a grab, stab, and slow, clumsy fall to the ground for every enemy I used it on. Shotguns are powerful and scary — just as Ellie can be knocked down, so too can an enemy. Choosing to fight – to graphically cut into an enemy’s throat or blast them against the wall with a shotgun – is tough to stomach in Part 2, intentionally so.\n“\n“\nAnd while it certainly reflects the reality of Ellie’s world, and its enemies reflect that character behavior back at you in powerful ways, I did sometimes find myself choosing to be stealthy and non-lethal just to save myself from watching a brutal blow. Avoiding combat entirely is often possible, but it’s rarely easy given how mobile and perceptive enemies are. I often had to sacrifice at least two or three enemies per encounter – especially when enemy dogs who can track Ellie’s scent are thrown into the mix.\nPart 2’s expansive environments aren’t just there to be sandboxes of death, though. The artfully detailed and realized locations tell layers of story, from the macro-destruction of a certain city district down to the posters and calendars hung on abandoned apartment walls. Some of the original Last of Us’ most interesting bits of backstory were found in scattered notes and diary pages, and the jump in detail for Part 2 astounded me. It seems as though every room has a story to tell, every office has a history, every store shows a place or group of people frozen in time. I spent more time than I’d care to admit studying abandoned D&D games in apartments, listening to ancillary conversations, and trying to read deteriorating book covers. Whether I found equipment and crafting materials or not, the thoughtful intent in each one of these objects and interactions made exploring feel valuable regardless.\nI never once had to grab a floating palette to serve as a raft for someone who couldn’t swim.Even better is that I never once had to navigate these areas by grabbing a floating palette to serve as a raft for someone who couldn’t swim, like the original so often asked us to do. Part 2’s environmental puzzles never feel as mindless as that – they have a lot more contextual challenges that make smart use of Ellie’s journey through skyscrapers, residential neighborhoods, sewers, plains, and more. From figuring out how to angle a rope to swing from one office to another locked room to navigating a perilous series of tripwires using Ellie’s new mobility to many more everyday tasks that take on new tension in a post-apocalypse setting, Part 2 makes much better use of its environment to offer unique, consistently engaging puzzles and platforming routes. And those clever designs are dressed with some of the most beautiful environments I’ve seen from the PlayStation 4/PlayStation 4 Pro generation.And while Part 2 is not an open-world game, it does include an open-world area that learns lessons from Uncharted 4 and Lost Legacy’s attempts at the same design idea, this time to much better effect. While those games presented areas of open, explorable wildernesses, they often didn’t have much to find there, making exploration feel somewhat aimless. In Part 2, though, a dilapidated district of Seattle offers years of lost history, a mixture of events frozen in time by the pandemic and those who have tried to survive here since. Its scope and scale won’t challenge Rockstar’s open-world games any time soon, but it shakes up the pacing in a needed way and is thoughtfully used by Naughty Dog to not only explain Part 2’s setting at large, but also allow for a number of welcome, discoverable character moments.\n“\n“\nIts scope and scale won’t challenge Rockstar’s open-world games any time soon, but it shakes up the pacing in a needed way.But even outside of that area, Jackson, other parts of Seattle, and more are gorgeous and memorable locations. The Wyoming countryside is lovely, too, whether it be mountains covered in bright snow or fields of wheat shining in the evening sunset. And sure, the Pacific Northwest is as rainy as you would expect, but Naughty Dog has taken the gloom of grey clouds and grey buildings and crafted something ominous, beautiful, and haunting. Lush vegetation grows over dilapidated storefronts and homes in the suburbs while the smashed, looming skyscrapers of the city form new, mesmerizing stone monuments. Seven years and a new generation has allowed Naughty Dog to create locations that, while very much like the ruined vestiges of civilization in the original, are so much more richly detailed, with more distinct and varied interiors, striking outdoor lighting, and inventive new locations that play to Seattle’s seaside setting.Evocative audio design, backed by the moving score of returning composer Gustavo Santaolalla, plays a big role as well. It all comes down to the little details: characteristically for the region, the oppressive thump of rain masks the terrifying noises of the infected that lurk outside; the slam of debris that blocks a doorway and the quiet creaking of an alternative exit; the slight hum of a silenced pistol versus the harrowing boom of a shotgun; and vocal performances from the guttural screams of the Clickers to the muttered self-reflection from Ellie as she kills an enemy.\n“\n“\nVerdict\nThe Last of Us Part 2 is a masterpiece worthy of its predecessor. Taking strides forward in nearly every way, Ellie steps into the spotlight and carries the sequel in a manner that feels like the culmination of everything that’s made Naughty Dog’s blockbuster storytelling so memorable since the original Uncharted on the PlayStation 3. It delivers a layered, emotionally shattering story on top of stealth and action gameplay that improves the first game’s mechanics while integrating a bit more of Uncharted’s greater mobility and action. But while Part 2 is a thrilling adventure, it still makes time for a stunning, nuanced exploration of the strength and fragility of the human spirit. The PlayStation 4 has one of its best exclusives in one of the generation’s best games.\nIn This Article\nThe Last of Us Part 2 Review\nmasterpiece\nThe Last of Us Part 2 is a masterpiece that evolves the gameplay, cinematic storytelling, and rich world design of the original in nearly every way.\nJonathon Dornbush\n10 Things We Noticed in Zelda Tears of the Kingdom - Video Feature\nIn this Legend of Zelda Tears of the Kingdom trailer breakdown, Logan Plant highlights Link's four new powers, along with bringing some speculation surrounding some hidden bits tucked away in the gameplay.\nResident Evil 4 Remake: The Mercenaries Mode - Leon S Rank Gameplay\nWe give the updated Mercenaries mode in Resident Evil 4 Remake a spin in this S-Rank gameplay clip, featuring Leon.

            "text": "There is much to admire in Naughty Dog’s ultra-dark revenge video game The Last Of Us Part II. And there is much to critique. The devs who poured their blood, sweat and tears into the game deserve praise for its technical achievements. The writers who mangled the story deserve the lumps that follow.\nDespite its gore and violence, The Last Of Us Part II is a beautiful game, with renditions of post-apocalyptic Seattle and Santa Barbara that are simply staggering in detail and scope. The sights and sounds of this game are lush and lovely, gruesome and harrowing. In terms of presentation, The Last Of Us Part II is easily one of the best of the generation.\nMeanwhile, the acting is—without exception—phenomenal throughout. Ashley Johnson as Ellie turns in another fantastic performance, with a great deal more of the spotlight this time around. Troy Baker’s Joel has a much smaller role, but he’s as good as ever. And man, both these two are just insanely talented. Watch this live performance of Wayfaring Stranger they put on:\nLaura Bailey, who plays the third main character in the game, Abby, is also excellent. Sure, her character is fairly loathsome, but Bailey is great.\nAlas, while the game is gorgeous to look at and listen to, and the acting is as good as any I’ve ever encountered in a video game, it falls apart when it comes to both gameplay and story.\nThe first game didn’t have much going for it in the gameplay department, either—neither game is particularly strong as an action/shooter, and each forces players to spend far too much time tediously picking up odds and ends in order to craft bombs and med-kits, and ammo for your routinely empty firearms. (There’s a setting that makes this somewhat less tedious in the sequel). When it comes to gameplay, both games are fine. Just fine. Not great, not terrible. Just fine.\nBut the first game’s lackluster gameplay was more than made up for by a compelling story filled with complex characters in a gritty, intriguing post-apocalyptic world. It didn’t hurt that it also had one of the best endings in video games, period.\nIt was an ending that deserved to be just that—the end of Joel and Ellie’s story, unresolved and bittersweet. Brittle and precarious and powerful all at once. A happy ending in many ways, but an unsettling one, too.\nJoel’s was a lie told out of love, but it was still a lie. He kept that secret for the same reason he rescued Ellie from the Fireflies. Because he couldn’t stand to lose his daughter. Not again.\nThat same lie kicks off the events in The Last Of Us Part II, but it quickly runs roughshod over everything we loved about the first game, trampling even our high opinions of the protagonists in the process. What follows is a too-pretentious-by-half story of nonsensical revenge and relentless violence. It masquerades at depth and meaning but fails to deliver either.\nBetter to leave us hanging than take us down this wallowing, nihilistic path of despair and misery porn. Unless you get off on that sort of thing, of course.\nAn Unnecessary Sequel\nUnfortunately, The Last Of Us Part II only follows in the original’s footsteps in the most generic ways. Chronologically, it comes after the first game and it takes place in the same post-apocalyptic America. In every other sense, it may as well be a completely new franchise. At least then it wouldn’t have so badly damaged the characters we came to know and care so much about in the original.\nIn the original, Ellie is a teenage girl who is the only person immune to the strange virus that’s caused this spore-based zombie apocalypse. Unlike every single other human, bites and spores don’t turn her into a monster. We don’t know why.\nJoel, who lost his own daughter tragically at the outset of the apocalypse, is tasked with bringing Ellie to the Firefly scientists where they hope to use her to find a cure. The Fireflies are freedom fighters. They’re here to help. Or so we’re led to believe.\nAlong the way, throughout the course of the game, Ellie and Joel become like family. It’s not an easy road, but they manage it together and in many ways Ellie becomes the daughter Joel lost, dragging him out of his long malaise and giving him something to believe in and to fight for. She’s spunky and funny and tough, and she awakens a new sense of purpose in the burned out, grizzled survivor.\nIn the end, when Joel and Ellie finally find the Fireflies, it turns out that the group isn’t all they were cracked out to be. The doctors are unethical murderers who decide that it’s just fine to sacrifice the one living person who is actually immune to the disease in order to create a vaccine (a completely absurd, anti-scientific, anti-medicine decision that exposes the Fireflies for the atrocious bastards they really are).\nJoel decides that sacrificing a young girl to save humanity is absolute crap and rescues her instead, killing some of the guards and doctors in the process. He does what every father would do in this situation—and what every ethical human being ought to do.\nThere is only one correct answer to the question “How many lives would you sacrifice to save humanity?”\nYour own. Only your own. It’s one thing to take life in order to save someone; it’s another to sacrifice an innocent in the hopes that you’ll save someone. So Joel takes lives in order to save an innocent. It’s unfortunate that he is forced to kill, but he couldn’t stand by and let it happen, either. He had no other ethical choice.\nEven if—and it’s a very, very big if—her death would have resulted in a vaccine, allowing it to happen would be cruel and immoral. And a doctor, above anybody else, should realize this. Certainly in our own fraught times we should understand just how tricky coming up with a vaccine is—and killing the one specimen that may hold the answer is not only cruel and immoral, it’s magnificently stupid.\nJoel lies to Ellie about it after the fact, telling her that it didn’t work, she wasn’t the answer. And off they go, riding into the sunset.\nIt’s the perfect ending. In my headcanon, I’m just going to pretend it’s the only ending.\nWhen Naughty Dog announced a sequel, creative director Neil Druckmann revealed that it would be a game about hate. The first was a game about love, the second hate. Like the tattooed fingers of Robert Mitchum in The Night of the Hunter.\nOne might wonder at this point, why you’d really even have to separate the two. Light is the left hand of darkness; love is the left hand of hatred. The first game had its fair share of hatred, after all. Unfortunately, the sequel really doesn’t bother much with love. When it does, it’s at its very best, but those moments are few and far between.\nThe first big problem with The Last Of Us Part II’s story is that there is very little about it that justifies its existence. It picks up a few years later, though there are flashbacks of the intervening years scattered about the game. We learn quickly where Ellie and Joel currently stand in their relationship. While the story itself is told in bits and pieces, jumping to different timelines, the basic premise is this:\nEllie has discovered that Joel lied to her and she’s mad about it. She’s mad that Joel didn’t let the Fireflies kill her in order to create a vaccine. She’s still mad at him when Abby, the daughter of the chief Firefly doctor, tracks down Joel and brutally murders him, exacting a ridiculously brutal revenge for her father’s murder. And right here, right in this one short paragraph, there is so much wrong that my head hurts even typing it out.\nFirst of all, the game seems to want us to think that Ellie is right and justified in her anger and that Joel is in the wrong. Not just about lying but about him saving her in the first place. The game suggests, in so many different ways, that Joel’s actions were selfish and wrong. There is an implicit sense, throughout the story, and especially in the way it attempts to empathize with both its angsty emo female leads, that we should accept that Joel was wrong. That his actions were somehow immoral.\nBut Joel was not wrong. The doctors who decided to throw out their entire ethical and moral codes by sacrificing a young girl in the off-chance that they might come up with a cure were wrong. Ellie is wrong to suggest that a person who loves and cares for her should simply stand by and watch as she’s murdered. That’s preposterous. Any parent knows this. Any parent would do the same thing as Joel. And any doctor worth a damn would never harbor such intentions, no matter how many zebras they save from barbed wire.\nBut in The Last Of Us Part 2, the doctor who decides to kill Ellie is portrayed as a good man who helps escaped zoo animals and loves his daughter. And his daughter, Abby, is somehow portrayed as justified in her brutal killing of Joel, and setup as an “equal” to Ellie in the game, given just as much (if not more) screen time by the time the credits role.\nI’ll get this out of the way right here: Abby’s revenge plot was deeply stupid from the start. At first, I didn’t even realize that this was the avenging daughter of the Firefly doctor because of how thin that rationalization would be. She doesn’t just kill Joel (who saved her life moments earlier, by the way) she makes him suffer. She wants it done slowly. And she does it with the support of a bunch of other people who, throughout the course of the game, are humanized and presented as sympathetic characters rather than the despicable monsters they are. (Later, Abby shows Ellie mercy despite her having killed several of those friends, which is kind of weird given the lengths she went to kill Joel . . .)\nIt’s one thing to get revenge because you watch your surrogate father beaten to death with a golf club, bloody and crumpled on the floor. It’s another to get revenge because someone killed your own murderous father while rescuing an innocent girl who he was about to kill.\nI mean, really? I get that you’d be upset that somebody killed your dad, but when the reasoning is “he was saving his daughter from certain death” that sort of takes the wind out of those vengeance sails, doesn’t it? Maybe if not for Abby, then for her compatriots who might, given a moment to think about it, consider Joel’s actions self-defense. And sure, you might want revenge, or you might shoot the guy if you run into him and act in a moment of pique, but tracking him down and then making him suffer while beating him to death with a golf club when you’re fully aware he did it to save his daughter? Give me a break.\nI’m just trying to puzzle out what kind of person goes this far out of their way to get bloody vengeance like this. A pretty evil person. Abby is evil right from the start. But the game and its creators don’t want you to think that. They want you to spend half the game empathizing with Abby. The other half of the game they want you to lose whatever respect you had for Ellie.\nThe Last Of Us Part II already makes it clear from the outset that we should have very little respect for Joel and his past choices. Then, instead of creating a sympathetic antagonist in Abby, they make her about as evil as possible and then ask us to see things from her point of view. It doesn’t work. The real victim of all of this is Ellie, however. I used to like Ellie quite a bit, but not by the time I finished this game.\nSo the whole game gets off to a rough start. It doesn’t get better from here.\nEllie and Abby are the two playable characters in The Last Of Us Part II. You play as Joel for a few minutes before he’s bludgeoned to death. In many ways, he’s the lucky one. At least we get to remember him as the caring father who saved Ellie and stuck by her through thick and thin. The game can try to convince us that he was in the wrong, but we know better. Joel is spared the next agonizing 25 to 30 hours, minus some flashbacks which are its finest moments (and a good template for what this game could have, and probably should have, been).\nEllie’s “death” is much more tragic, because the game proceeds to ruin her character in every subsequent scene, thoroughly destroying any semblance of who she once was and turning her into a relentlessly selfish, murderous jerk. All because somebody thought that a story about a cycle of revenge would be more interesting than a story about wandering through an abandoned museum.\nI bring that up because to me, the museum bit was the most powerful piece of storytelling in the entire game. In a flashback, Joel takes Ellie to a surprise. She tries to guess what it is along the way, and the two banter back and forth like the good old days.\nThe surprise is an abandoned museum. The first thing you see is a giant T-Rex outside its doors, and if you’re the exploring type you discover that you can climb up its back and leap off its head into the pool below. Maybe you do this two or three times just because it’s so light and breezy and you desperately need a break from grim and awful. It’s such a cool bit of storytelling. It’s so at odds with the rest of the game.\nOnce inside the museum, Ellie and Joel explore the displays. There are various dinosaurs and astronaut suits, and even an old rocket ship which you can go into and imagine you’re taking off into outer space. You find an old Indiana Jones hat (a little nod to Uncharted) which you can toss onto one of the dinosaur’s heads. It’s imaginative and beautiful.\nThe sequence takes a dark turn in the end, and that juxtaposition of whimsy and terror makes it by far my favorite part of the game. Joel and Ellie are still a team. They have some great bonding moments. There’s some laughs, a good scary bit and it’s done. I wish the entire game had been like this. Moments of beauty and moments of ugliness woven together in a kind of bleak harmony. Some contrast, some variety.\nInstead, it’s a game about two young women trying to kill one another, while everyone around them also tries to kill each other. You stab and/or break so many necks by the time it’s over, you start to feel a bit numb.\nIt’s a game about hate and don’t you dare forget it.\nLet’s Not Bicker And Argue Over Who Killed Who\nAfter Joel’s vicious murder, Ellie feels like crap. She wants revenge and so does Tommy, Joel’s brother. He sets out first and Ellie sets out a bit later, accompanied by her new girlfriend, Dina. Halfway through the game, you go back in time to when Ellie and Dina arrive in the city, but you play the next few days as Abby instead, seeing things through her eyes. This is an odd choice given how thoroughly we despise Abby at this point, and it never stops being an odd choice. While some of her story is interesting, she really isn’t. She’s a one-note character who, beyond being a murderer, does really crappy things to people she cares about. Abby sucks. A lot.\nIn Seattle, two factions do battle as Ellie and Abby traverse the city, Ellie searching for Abby to get revenge, while Abby looks for her wayward ex-boyfriend, Owen. The Wolves and the Seraphites (nicknamed the Scars) vie for control of the city.\nThe former is a group of former rebels who shook off the yoke of a tyrannical post-apocalyptic government and set up their own quasi-fascistic organization. Only now with burritos! They’ve taken in Abby and some other former Fireflies, like Owen. (They’re not a couple anymore, but Abby and Owen have sex in the game despite Owen’s current girlfriend being very, very pregnant. Because Abby is the worst).\nThe Scars, meanwhile, are a fanatical cult-like group—the kind that shows up in video games like this and in TV shows like The Walking Dead. They’re kind of like The Whisperers from AMC’s zombie drama, as in they’re so over-the-top it’s completely immersion-breaking. The game’s writers must have thought they were crafting a realistic post-apocalyptic group, but the Scars come off as cartoonishly vile and utterly preposterous.\nAlso, the Scars shoot arrows that are far more deadly than the most powerful gun in the game, so that’s a neat trick.\nSuffice to say, the Scars are a completely implausible group that cartoonifies the sequel in ways that simply didn’t happen in the first entry. There were some very bad people in the original Last Of Us, but I never rolled my eyes the way I did with the Scars.\nIn any case, most of the game—after the opening and before the final act—takes place in Seattle across a three day period. Ellie and Dina arrive in Seattle and start tracking down Abby. During that same period, Abby explores the war-torn city and we see how the Wolves vs Scars war plays out.\nThus begins a story of revenge and violence in which Ellie stabs a couple hundred men and women in the jugular a few times and Abby breaks countless necks. Between the two of them, Ellie and Abby must murder a few hundred people, but of course only Joel and Abby’s father’s deaths warrant retaliatory bloodshed. All those other deaths? No big deal.\nOh, and when you kill someone and another AI bad guy finds their body, they’ll call out the deceased’s name like it means something.\n“No, not Timothy!” “They killed Kenny!” “Brenda!!!”\nIt’s another little touch that’s designed to make the game’s world and people seem more real. It doesn’t work. At all. Hearing Generic Bad Guy call out the name of Dead Generic Bad Guy only made me chuckle and roll my eyes. I’m coming for you next, pal. This shiv’s for you!\nWe have the same half-dozen enemy character models repeated over and over again throughout the game, but I’m supposed to feel something—some sense of guilt, perhaps?\nNot hardly.\nI mean, the game doesn’t even give you a non-lethal option and stealth mechanics are severely limited so why not just murder everyone?\nThe Slog Of Slogs\nMeanwhile, pacing is a mess. The Last Of Us Part II drags on far too long with too many encounters, too many dramatic moments and too much redundancy. I’d take a game half the length with just a few more interesting set-pieces to replace all the endless slaughter.\nThere are a few named characters Ellie finds and kills as she tracks down Abby, and at least one of these encounters has oomph (when Ellie discovers that she’s killed a pregnant woman, having just found out about Dina’s pregnancy) but largely this sense that we’re supposed to feel bad for all this killing feels more like something Naughty Dog is hammering into us rather than part of a well-crafted story.\nI watched a bit of footage I’d captured the other day where Ellie stabs this guy in the neck four or five times and it’s just gross. It doesn’t make me feel bad it just feels completely gratuitous. I simply don’t care about any of these people I violently murder in The Last Of Us Part II, and honestly, neither does Ellie. That may be the real problem with the game’s violence. It doesn’t square with the game’s seriousness or flimsy attempts at some kind of message. It’s so nihilistic so much of the time, you get the sense that there is no message. Nothing learned, nothing gained. No meaning to be found, even when you get to the dregs.\nYes, we get a sense that Ellie is traumatized by all the violence. When Abby let’s her go for a second time, despite having just killed everyone Abby cares about (and despite Abby having proven already that she’s the vengeful type so this mercy makes no sense whatsoever) we follow Ellie and Dina and Dina’s new baby to a farmhouse where they’ve cobbled together a new life together. But what appears to be all peaches and sunshine falls apart when Ellie has a bad flashback. Tommy shows up and chastises her for not killing Abby. So Ellie gives up her nice little life and sets off again, to try to kill Abby again.\nBecause Ellie learns nothing in this game. She must have left behind two hundred corpses in Seattle, including all of Abby’s friends, but that’s not enough to sate her thirst for comeuppance, and she doesn’t realize, bafflingly, that it will never be enough. Revenge won’t bring Joel back and it won’t assuage her guilt at how she treated him and it won’t lead to a life of happiness.\nBut off she goes to California.\nMany people who aren’t super-fans of Naughty Dog were incredibly upset by the game’s ending. So was I, but for somewhat different reason. We’ll get to that in a second.\nAfter her stint at the farm, Ellie abandons Dina and the infant they were raising together to once again seek out Abby, this time in Santa Barbarra. It’s just another way the game makes you hate Ellie. Her pettiness, her bitterness, her endless self-obsession and selfishness. That the game feels it necessary to have Ellie try for revenge once, fail, and then go out again is pretty ludicrous from a narrative standpoint, not only extending the game for no good reason—it’s about ten hours too long—but making Ellie out to be even more unsympathetic in the process.\nIn any case, Ellie ditches Dina (who deserves better, quite frankly) and the child and heads to Santa Barbara. It’s a great location, all sun and heat compared to Seattle’s rain and gloom; orange and yellow instead of green and grey. Once again, Naughty Dog proves that it can craft some truly jaw-dropping environments. Your first moments in Santa Barbara are wonderfully scary and tense.\nBut once again we have another group of wicked bastards to contend with. This group is called The Rattlers. The Rattlers aren’t as psycho as the Scars, but they’re close. They keep slaves and crucify troublemakers down at the beach. In Naughty Dog’s apocalypse, life truly is nasty, brutish and short. Psychopaths and creepy cults are everywhere.\nThis group must have sounded good on paper but to me the Rattlers are just more cartoon villains for us to stab and shoot and blow sky high, this time with a silenced SMG in your arsenal. There must be a more nuanced take on the apocalypse that all these game and TV show studios could come up with, one in which people are complicated, and groups of people aren’t always so different from one another. But so far, only the Jackson, WY settlement seems to be comprised of real people with actual shades of grey.\nI’d say that Naughty Dog tried to make Abby and the Wolves complex, too, but they kind of botched that when they had them murder Joel in the very beginning. Every subsequent attempt to humanize Abby and her co-conspirators falls short thanks to that misstep.\nIn any case, back to Santa Barbara.\nThe sequence starts with Abby and her companion Lev searching for the Fireflies in Santa Barbara. We met Lev back in Seattle. He and his sister were Scars, but they were cast out and were going to be killed when Lev cut his hair. Lev, we discover, is biologically female but wants to identify as male, and the uber-religious Scars think this is an unforgivable sin. It’s a pretty ham-handed attempt at tackling the issue of trans people and tolerance in the game, simply because the Scars are so outlandishly awful. But Lev is a good character and Lev and Abby’s relationship is the one point of redemption in Abby’s entire arc, and one which I wish Naughty Dog had handled almost entirely differently. More on that later.\nAbby and Lev are looking for the Fireflies so they can rejoin Abby’s old group, and just when they’ve made contact over the radio they’re ambushed and taken prisoner by the Rattlers. You can tell right away that these are Very Bad Dudes.\nSometime later, Ellie shows up, following the lead Tommy gave her back at the farmhouse. She discovers the Resort and this new enemy faction after creeping through some very zombie-infested buildings. One thing this game does do very well is make the various spore zombies scary, as much through their terrifying warbling and screeching as anything. Naughty Dog’s sound design is matched only by their graphical prowess. Nobody can discount just how technically and artistically this game succeeds. It’s the writing, the narrative, where everything falls apart.\nAnd we come, at long last, to the ending.\nThis Is The End, Beautiful Friend\nDepending on how you play, you either sneak or blast your way through the Resort area until you free some prisoners and they tell you that Abby has already been taken and punished for trying to escape. So you head to the beach as the prisoners go to battle with their former captors (or what’s left of them after Ellie cleaved her bloody path through their ranks).\nShe walks down to the beach. It’s dark. The sounds of combat echo in the distance. The sea is draped in fog. Abby and Lev, along with countless others, are hanging from posts, basically crucified and on the verge of death, skeletal from starvation. It’s as grim and awful as anything we’ve seen up to this point.\nIt’s just that we’re all so very, very numb by now. Another fresh hell stuffed into 30 hours of grimdark violence, atrocity and betrayal. A powerful moment that needed to come much, much sooner. (Honestly, they should have scrapped California entirely and had Ellie find Abby strung up by the Scars in Seattle).\nStill, it’s probably the first time I felt real sympathy for Abby. No matter how much of a monster she was—a faithless friend, a brutal killer, a small-minded ruffian—it’s tough to see even your worst enemy starved, hanging from a post, dying slowly. And Lev was innocent. He didn’t deserve this fate. Nobody does.\nWhen Ellie cuts her down, and Abby carries Lev to a boat to make good their escape, and it looks like Ellie has finally realized that revenge really doesn’t make anything better, I was actually pleasantly surprised. There is a beauty in mercy. Even Abby showed mercy—not once, but twice—to Ellie, after all.\nAbby is not a sympathetic character and nothing the game tries made me like her, but I do want to like Ellie. Ellie taking revenge on Joel’s killer might feel good, but Ellie showing mercy makes her more human. It makes her a better person. It means that after all this blood and death and hate, she could come out the other side as someone who has grown and changed and run the gauntlet of suffering and still come out the other side with her self intact.\nIf she had simply turned around and left her to her fate, I could have accepted that ending as well. It would have been more cruel and Ellie would have been less humanized by it, but at least it would have been a decisive and powerful ending.\nOr if Abby were already dead, there would have been some poetic justice to that as well. Ellie’s hands would be clean. Well, not clean exactly but cleaner. I’ve heard it said those damned spots don’t come out.\nBut instead, Ellie cuts her down. And they go their separate ways, not friends or allies, but united in suffering and tragedy. An end to the cycle of violence. Something like resolution, however bitter and incomplete.\nOnly, no, not quite. We need some mud-wrestling, don’t we? We need to see the women get down and dirty. We need that sweet, sweet misery porn.\nWhat follows is the single worst moment in the entire game (aside from forcing us to play as Abby for fifteen hours of it, or the total character assassination of Ellie). Instead of cutting her down, showing mercy, Ellie decides that actually she still needs to get revenge. Wouldn’t want all that stabbing practice to go to waste, right?\nShe’s going to stab this woman, who has been starving to death hanging from a pole, until she bleeds out and dies. Only, not really. Nope. She’s going to stab and slash her a few times and then let her go again.\nFun times. This is really how I want to spend my video game time.\nHave Mercy\nNow, a lot of people are angry that Ellie didn’t end up going through with it, that she spared her sworn enemy. They hated Abby and think that a satisfying ending required Abby to die, and Ellie to kill her. I think that’s rubbish. Sure, it could have worked in different circumstances. If Ellie and Abby had met on equal terms, for instance. But this “I’m going to save you and let you live, oh never mind time to die, oh never mind again you can live” nonsense is just bad writing.\nRevenge can be fun. John Wick does “fun revenge” very well. I remember watching Braveheart for the first time and William Wallace’s revenge was thrilling. But the moral of the story in serious works of fiction is that revenge is bitter (not bittersweet) and never quite plays out the way you’d hoped. It creates a cycle of violence that hurts everyone caught up in its wake. Hamlet is consumed by his desire for revenge—prompted by the ghost of his father—but in the end it just means that everyone dies, including innocents like Polonius and Ophelia and, though she’s perhaps a little less innocent, Hamlet’s mother as well. Revenge, like that green-eyed monster, jealousy, is dangerous. Something to be avoided if at all possible. Even justifiable revenge—think A Time To Kill—can lead to all sorts of problems.\nWhat this game needed in the end was grace. The kind of strange, unsettling thing that comes over someone when they suddenly realize something profound and choose to take a different path. When Ellie sees her emaciated enemy hanging from a poll and, instead of feeling gleeful satisfaction, feels only horror and pity, she acted with grace and mercy and, in that moment, became the person we hoped she would become. It was never about killing Abby. It was about Ellie finding her own redemption.\nAnd then they throw it all away.\nTwo angry, beat up, half-dead murderesses slicing each other over and over again in the shallows, blood and saltwater spraying everywhere, until suddenly Ellie gives up and let’s Abby go. Again. I’m not one to usually criticize games for their violence, but this felt exploitative to me. And redundant. All that potential for mercy and grace lost.\nEllie already let her go! She already came to the conclusion that she should let Abby live when she cut her down! Why go through all that again? Why have this horrible, violent, senseless slasher fight if, at its conclusion, Ellie simply let’s Abby go again?\nThe ending could have worked with mercy or revenge as the outcome, but apparently the writers had trouble making up their minds about which direction they wanted to go, and decided to try and have their cake and eat it, too. The result feels sloppy, repetitive and frustrating.\nMore than anything, this game’s ending needed to not beat around the bush.\nEither cut her down and let her live (mercy) or have Ellie take revenge (leave her to die) or have her already dead when Ellie gets there (chance). You can’t have it both ways, all ways, whatever. If you want to end the game with a knife fight, do that. But don’t make Ellie cut her down first. Have them meet as equals. It’s too much like Indigo Montoya helping the Man in Black up the cliff just so he can kill him. Only not in the least bit funny.\nThe last scene, when Ellie returns home to an empty farmhouse, Dina and her baby long gone, is better. A fitting reward for Ellie’s selfish, self-destructive obsession with revenge.\nA game about hate, sure, but even more a game about loss.\nRequiem aeternam dona eis, Domine.\nNot everything about The Last Of Us Part II’s story was terrible. I loved all of Ellie’s flashbacks with Joel and Tommy. I might have even enjoyed Abby’s if her character deserved it.\nAs I noted further up, I also very much enjoyed the sights and sounds. Graphically, few games I’ve ever played can compare. For all its violence and misery, The Last Of Us Part II is a true beauty. Sound design, though, is what really makes it scary. When the game bothers trying to be scary it succeeds more often than not.\nGameplay gets bogged down at times by the lack of a full-fledged stealth system and somewhat dense AI, but there are still some exhilarating sequences and combat, while far from my favorite, can be tense and exciting. There’s simply too much of it, like there’s too much of just about everything here. Too much crafting, too much scavenging (though remember there’s an option to make that more tolerable), too much story and too many hours of game to get through.\nFor all my complaints—complaints I genuinely found made me dislike this game and everyone in it more and more the longer I played it, and the longer I stewed over it after—I still had something resembling fun while playing. I finished the damn thing, which is more than I can say for a lot of games.\nI also really enjoyed the entire frightening intro sequence with Yara and Lev, and those characters in general. If only Abby had had some sort of dawning realization about Lev and her relationship with Lev made her better understand Joel’s actions. She could have let go of some of that hate. If Abby had realized that protecting Lev from Isaac and the WLF was basically exactly what Joel was doing by rescuing Ellie from her dad and the Fireflies (only he knew Ellie a lot longer) we might have actually had a story with some interesting dynamic character arcs.\nActually, the more I think about it, the more I wish that The Last Of Us Part II had never been about Joel and Ellie at all, and that the entire thing had been the story of Abby and her desire for revenge and how that transformed into understanding and forgiveness for her father’s killer as she grew into the role of protector and surrogate mother for Lev. She could have found empathy along the way, and chosen to spare Joel’s life, sparing Ellie her own story of revenge and horror, and saving all four characters in the process.\nPerhaps a game about hate could have turned into a game about love, after all.\nP.S. This was a strangely challenging review for me to write. I didn’t get a review copy so I was late to actually playing it, but even after I finished the game I had a hard time putting pen to paper. I finished my first draft of this review weeks ago and then found myself unable to come back to it. I’m not entirely sure why.\nIn one sense, it’s because the game left me with such conflicting feelings. It’s clearly a very good game in many ways, and yet also sort of horrible at the same time. And even though I ultimately found the tale of revenge and violence too pretentious and not nearly as effective as its creators hoped, I was still haunted by it. It had emotional resonance even while not really standing up to scrutiny. So my apologies for the very late review, but sometimes that’s how it goes. Writer’s block is a helluva thing.\nP.P.S. I wrote that first P.S. a couple weeks ago and still didn’t publish this thing for some reason. Today I went back in and edited a lot of it. I’m probably still not entirely satisfied, but oh well. I’m going to publish it now, come hell or high water.",

            "text": "This truly was a great game, the overall design and gameplay was a major step up from the original with improved controls, better weapon interface and aiming controls, the archery interface was greatly improved over the original. The game is also perfect in its presentation. The graphical fidelity is off the charts and is the absolute best that the PS4 has to offer, Ghost of Tsushima and Uncharted 4 are the only two that come close. I liked how the game took a break from its linear design every now and then and let you wander around in larger and more open environments. Overall the combat and enemy placement strategy is very well done in this game and what is even more well done is the boss design. The Rat King might just be the greatest boss ever put in a horror game and even rivals the greatest and most memorable bosses from Dead Space, Resident Evil and even the first Last of Us game.\nSo yes the gameplay has improved, just as it has improved over every singly Naughty Dog Third Person Shooter all the way from Uncharted 1 in 2007, but all the infamy of this game that is still rather new all lies in the narrative. This will obviously be a spoiler heavy review since I am going to discuss major details right ahead.\nThe Last of Us: Part II is a revenge story at its core and is very different thematically from the previous. What made the original game so popular and beloved was that it was a perfect mixture of light and darkness shown in extreme polar opposites. Showing the full spectrum of the best and worst of humanity and how genuine glimmers of hope and joy can outweigh the odds of the heaviest forms of darkness and despair. Last of Us 1 is highly regarded as the perfect video game narrative and not just the best in gaming history but even rivals some of the greatest in all of fictional media. Everyone loves a good story of hope and genuine humanity, and is exactly why Part II has become so polarised and hated by a lot of people. Those two elements are almost completley missing from it.\nI do have to hand it to Naughty Dog for doing something different, you don't just want a carbon copy of the original and it hard to top that particular hope driven story anyway, so what do you do differently next time around. Well the revenge driven plot is a popular route to take movies with films like John Wick being very popular and raking in a lot of money. There is something very satisfying about revenge and definitely can satisfy your darker primal and more primitive emotions when you see a movie character lay carnage on the ones that made them suffer. So why not do that in a video game, I don't really see many video games that have taken this plot choice this extremley before, and you think it would be a satisfying experience. Well yes and no.\nThe main shocker of this game is the choice of killing of Joel only about 2 hours into the games story which becomes the inciting incident for the entire story. The cruelty of the scene is so brutally raw, that it's no wonder why so many fans were upset. I don't really get upset when I see a fictional character get killed off, because that's all they really are. A fictional character in a fictional story. I do agree that it was pretty distasteful though to have him thrown away to the side like that so quickly. As the same time though, it is a pretty brave choice to do this and I also have to applaud them. This isn't some happy feel good tale, this is The Last of Us, it's of course going to be a dark story and yes you will probably feel upset by what happens in it.\nSo the murder of Joel starts Ellie's journey of tracking down the killer, who is Abby. I kind of feel that the second reason why people were upset by this game is what this leads up to. As I said before, revenge is an extremely primal emotion and can be extremely satisfying and addictive. Many people were probably feeling a bit of a high in the games leadup to the encounter with Abby hoping that it would the moment the player gets to kill her and deliver some form of hard hitting and satisfying justice. But this does not happen. The game then subverts your expectations and makes you play Abby herself in her shoes instead. Taking you back a few days to the exact same time when Ellie began her vengeance driven hunt.\nI for one was confused at first. But I actually grew to like this part of the game, as it shows the player to not be so quick to judge people you know nothing about. Even if what they've done is evil or horrific. Sure, what Abby did was evil, but you begin to see why the life she led and the type of people she was associated with drove her to make that choice.\nI think I should talk about the factions that are in this game. It's focused around 3 different groups. The Boston Outpost where Joel, Ellie and her freinds are from which I will call \"Team Ellie\". They are mainly presented as the \"good guys\" and the people that the game defaults you to root for. Then there is the \"WLF\" which is a military based faction that Abby is assigned with that are against what Joel did in St Mary's Hospital in the finale of the first game. These are presented as the villains at first but then leaves it up to you of just how good or evil they really are after you understand their motivations.\nThat leaves you to the third and final faction in the game. The Seraphites. These guys are just completely and utterly insane. They are a primal extremist and religious cult who will simply destroy anyone who gets in their way or doesn't believe their views. They are basically nothing more than ruthless animals that are brainwashed beyond any hope of reason by their dogma. The scariest thing about them is that you never learn exactly what it is that they believe in, you are only given hints of just the extent of how intensive and the dogma really is based around.\nYou will be fighting a lot of these in Abby's portion of the game, and the moral narrative can become very confusing but also very interesting as you start to wonder which faction is more evil. How evil Abby is as a person truly, and whether anyone can find redemption for what they've done.\nYou also see how Ellie's humanity and goodness becomes slowly destroyed as she just cannot let go of her fixation of exacting vengeance on Abby, and it's hard to watch such a likeable character in the first game start to go so horribly dark and evil aswell.\nSo basically the underlying message of The Last of Us 2 is that seeking revenge or vengeance is ultimately not worth it, no matter what it may be about, because it will ruin you and you will not feel a sense of satisfaction or reduction if you try and sort things out this way. I think however one way this game could have been improved is that if it was choice driven like Mass Effect, BioShock or Undertale, where the story could have gone in different directions if you attempted to practice mercy or forgiveness on Abby instead of trying to kill her. Instead what you get it a 25 hour long linear one tracked slaughterfest as you watch the most likeable and light driven character of the first game become broken by her own evil and warped sense of justice and how vengeance and revenge destroys all.\nI myself enjoyed the ride, but I can see why many will find this a journey that they will loathe start to finish. Maybe Naughty Dog can make Part III a choice driven game, how hard that might be. It would be very interesting if they concluded the story in this way, because from the way this game ended, it looks like there is a bit more to tell.\n11 out of 14 found this helpful.\nWas this review helpful?

            "text": "Release date: June 19, 2020\nPlatform(s): PS4\nDeveloper: Naughty Dog\nPublisher: Sony Interactive\nThe Last of Us 2 (opens in new tab) has consumed me. It's the last thing I've been thinking about as I've gone to bed, and the first thing that enters my head when I wake up. I've relived entire sequences in my mind, marvelling at their exquisite design, and wondering what I could have done differently. Its many, many unforgettable cutscenes are burned into my brain as though they were real memories, so evocative in their fierce, emotional resonance that they now hold a regular presence in most of my dreams, not to mention my nightmares.\nI've spent hours just trying to process everything I've played, coming to terms with its densely packed story, and discovering new avenues of appreciation for its craft. What I'm trying to say is that The Last of Us Part 2 is exceptional, and quite possibly the best game I've played this generation.\nAs a heads up, this review is completely spoiler free, so I won't be discussing any plot details outside of what Naughty Dog has already shown so far.\nNew world order\nIf 2013's The Last of Us (opens in new tab) was a road trip turned twisted coming of age story, The Last of Us Part 2 is its revenge western companion piece. Set five years after the events of her pan-American odyssey with Joel, an indescribably traumatic opening episode leaves Ellie hellbent on a crusade to hunt down those responsible for a seemingly unforgivable crime. This pursuit takes our teenage heroine away from the rural pastures of Jackson County and deep into the urban overgrowth of Seattle, a city that experienced a very different kind of societal breakdown to The Last of Us' Boston, and thus poses its own unique threats to Ellie's survival.\nI won't divulge any more details beyond that, but suffice to say that what starts out as a fairly straightforward tale of retribution morphs into something far more complex, surprising, and sinister. As with the original game, Naughty Dog cunningly exploits the interactivity of its medium with masterful assuredness, forcing players to take a cold, hard look at every action they make as Ellie, with all the discomfort and distress that entails.\nThe resulting 25 hour campaign is as full of controller-dropping 'holy crap' moments as it is the quiet, contemplative scenes of immense poignancy that the studio is known for, many of which are enough to leave a lump in the throat, if not render you a bawling wreck on the couch. As a contemplation of the thin line between justice and vengeance, and an uncomfortable plunge into the darker shades of the human psyche, The Last of Us Part 2 is unforgiving in its depiction of violence, nihilism, and the nebulousness of morality in a world without laws.\nAt the heart of it all, however, is Ellie, once again textured with incredible warmth and humanity by Ashley Johnson, in the kind of performance that we'll still be talking about years from now. The complexity of suffering is no easy thing to depict on screen, but Johnson's ownership of Ellie's character throughout it all is nothing short of awards worthy, aided seamlessly by Naughty Dog's cutting edge facial animation technology, which lets even the slightest change in body language speak a thousand words.\nEllie is surrounded by an equally compelling cast of characters, too, with new additions like Shannon Woodward's Dina, Stephen Chang's Jesse, and many others quickly proving themselves to be as well-rounded and multi-dimensional as the game's returning cast of familiar faces. Speaking of, Troy Baker steals some of Part 2's best scenes as Joel, showing us new sides to the character that enriches and complicates the relationship we developed with him over the course of the first game. If you thought The Last of Us' giraffe scene was a tear jerker, boy does this sequel have some treasures for you.\nSleepless in Seattle\nThe Last of Us Part 2's story is one of great scale and intricate nuance, then, and the same can be said for its world. Naughty Dog has stretched the parameters of its linear game design to create environments that always feel like part of something larger than you are, yet are still crammed to the gills with the kind of handmade detail typically only reserved for more compactly structured single-player experiences.\nYou can spend hours poring over the digital seams of every building, forest, and cavern, not just out of a desire to scavenge as much craftable scrap material as Ellie can carry, but to soak up the atmosphere and enjoy the bespoke minutiae of Naughty Dog's handiwork. Every place has a story, offering a window into both the world that Ellie never knew, and the one she's all too familiar with, all told authentically through deftly placed artefacts, heuristic clues, and cleverly devised organic moments that bring each space to life.\nNaughty Dog's environmental design still gently guides you along the critical path even with all that added emphasis on exploration, though, and never in a way that feels forced, or draws you out of the illusion. The sense of pace and flow that underscores each level as a result is impeccable, each mission resembling a playable tapestry that builds and crescendos at a tempo that always feels unpredictable and compelling.\nIt helps that Ellie is now able to navigate terrain far more competently than Joel ever could, smashing windows, abseiling off walls, and jumping from precarious heights to enter previously unreachable areas, allowing Naughty Dog to challenge players with more diverse environmental puzzles that enrich combat and exploration. These new gameplay mechanics are hardly novel ideas to the video game discipline, but they're deployed in The Last of Us Part 2 with the same level of care and dexterity as every other, all working in tandem to conjure a distinct sense of place anchored in that patented Naughty Dog approach to authenticity.\nIt should go without saying, of course, that The Last of Us Part 2 is the PlayStation studio's best looking title yet, and quite possibly the most visually impressive game we've seen on the PS4 to date. When sunlight flickers through the fern flanked forests rustling gently against the breeze, or the Seattle skyline burns red in the ambient hues of dusk, it's a thing of abject beauty, and you'll have no choice but to make use of Last of Us Part 2's helpful in-game photo mode.\nClicking into place\nThe Last of Us' guerilla style combat, too, has similarly been sophisticated to heighten the breakneck, jittery tension that permeates every skirmish. That's largely thanks to some of the most advanced enemy AI you'll ever have the (mis)fortune of brushing up against, who - like everything else in The Last of Us Part 2 - look and act disturbingly lifelike.\nAdversaries call each other out by name, adopt revised strategies in reaction to your behaviour, and deploy new tools such as hunting dogs to sniff Ellie out from cover. Thankfully, Ellie can more easily float between stealth and open combat than Joel, able to use decade's worth of post-apocalyptic overgrowth as natural cover, or manoeuvre between small gaps to evade enemies and get the drop on others.\nWhen you are caught out, and you almost certainly will be, fights descend into a messy trade of gunfire, explosives, and physical blows. It's here where things get extra stressful, particularly when the combat enters close quarters, and The Last of Us' nauseating depiction of raw violence refuses to let you inure to the full weight of your actions, the agonising screams and jugular death rattles of your victims haunting your memory long after you've killed them.\nThe next evolution of The Last of Us' infected, meanwhile, are more terrifying than ever before. The now iconic throat percussion of Clickers may still be enough to send a shiver down your spine whenever they fall within earshot, but just wait till you hear the guttural moans of Part 2's walking toxin bombs, the Shamblers, or find yourself backed into a dark room with… well, I'll let you discover the rest for yourself.\nNaughty Dog leans unexpectedly hard into the horror side of its survival horror subject matter, amplifying the fear factor in ways that surprise, impress, and spook in equal measure, likely to leave even the most habituated gore hounds with their hands shaking. Thankfully, Ellie has plenty of choices at her disposal to stay two steps ahead of her aggressors. New craftable tools, from explosive arrows to trip mines, embellish the improvised warfare with more opportunities for collateral damage, while the addition of skill trees - unlocked via Supplements and Hobbyist Magazines found across Seattle - offer players yet more agency in making those tough calls about where to best spend resources.\nWeapon workbenches are also back, rendered in insanely fastidious detail, and Part 2 expands The Last of Us' returning arsenal of firearms with a number of surprising new additions that I won't spoil here. That said, all boast the mechanical rigour you'd expect from Naughty Dog's tactile gunplay, always feeling impactful when a shot lands but never reliable enough to get you from point A to B through sheer force alone.\nAll of these systems and mechanics operate together seamlessly in The Last of Us Part 2 like gears in a clock bound by a distinct, singular vision, conjuring up an experience that never feels anything less than an exemplary feat of impeccable game design.\nIf there's perhaps one area where The Last of Us Part 2 can be faulted, it's for occasionally getting lost amidst the reeds of its own ambition. Like that of Uncharted 4 (opens in new tab), the scale of Naughty Dog's plot can fall into the habit of overwriting itself, losing its momentum out of a need to tie up every story thread or emphasise a thematic point that had already been made hours ago.\nThat deviation from its narrative focal point is rare at best, and doesn't undercut the impact of what is otherwise an incredibly powerful cautionary fable, but the game's layered, prestige television-style structure is excessive to the point of exhaustive at times. Relatedly, if the ending of The Last of Us was controversial for all the right reasons, Part 2's doesn't quite land with as much subversive tact, though does nothing to undo the resonance of the journey leading up to its final scene.\nBut no masterpiece is perfect, and The Last of Us Part 2 is absolutely a masterpiece, have no doubt. There is so much more about this game that I'm desperate to sing its praises for, but simply can't without spoiling anything beyond what's already been shown. Daring, uncompromising, and unlike anything I've played in a long, long time, Naughty Dog has created its most progressive interactive adventure yet.\nThe Last of Us Part 2 not only justifies its existence as a sequel most didn't think was necessary, supplementing and elevating the timeless qualities of its predecessor, but stands confidently apart as an entirely different beast, one bearing its own fangs that bite with just as much force. The lasting achievement is nothing short of extraordinary, and a game we'll be looking back on for decades to come.",

            "text": "The Last of Us Part II isn’t fun. Over the game’s 20-hour runtime, I often found myself wanting to quit because the violence became unbearable. I didn’t want to bash that lunging dog with a hammer or slice at that defenseless woman with a knife. I certainly didn’t want to watch a religious zealot’s head explode into a grisly cloud because of my well-placed shotgun blast. There are scenes so upsetting that they didn’t just make me uncomfortable; they made me question why I was playing this game at all.\nYet, I’m glad I pushed through — because those dark, disturbing moments are what make The Last of Us Part II so powerful. It’s not just a game about violence. It’s one that grapples with the impact of that violence and shows players the consequences.\nThe Last of Us Part II is a sequel to the acclaimed PS3 game, which transformed developer Naughty Dog — then known primarily for lighter fare like the Uncharted series — into a studio able to tackle more serious and resonant stories. On the surface, the two games are similar. The original starred Joel, a haunted man who latches on to 14-year-old Ellie as a daughter figure, in a quest that sees them traverse a post-apocalyptic America in search of safety. It ends with him making a devastating choice to protect someone he cares about.\nThe sequel is centered on Ellie, now 19 and settled in a relatively safe community in Wyoming. She has work, friends, a love interest. She struggles with Joel’s overprotective nature. Aside from the regular patrols to clear out infected monsters, it’s almost idyllic. But a few hours into the game — for reasons I won’t spoil — she sets off for Seattle with vengeance on her mind.\nThe first half of The Last of Us Part II feels like exactly what it is: an upgraded version of the original game. It’s still a third-person action / adventure game where everything around you is dangerous. Seattle’s many buildings are filled with unsettling zombie-like creatures: ones that are blind and move by sound, forcing you to be quiet and slow, others that scream in a horrifyingly human way and will stop at nothing to kill you. The city is in a state of war. Two factions — a militant organization known as WLF and a religious group called the Seraphins — fight constantly over conflicting ideologies and limited resources. Ellie’s quest puts her directly in the middle of this turmoil.\nPlaying The Last of Us Part II is reminiscent of Uncharted 4: A Thief’s End. Both games are essentially more robust and polished versions of their predecessors, and TLOU2 borrows liberally from Nathan Drake’s final adventure, from the wide-open but linear levels to the combination of gunplay and stealth. Even the way you pick up objects and turn them over in your hands is identical. The difference is tone. While structurally and mechanically similar, the two games differ in terms of how they make you feel. Uncharted 4 is a sunny, lighthearted adventure with the occasional emotional breakthrough. TLOU2 is its antithesis: dark and oppressive with only rare, all-too-brief moments of hope.\nIt’s dark and oppressive with only rare, all-too-brief moments of hope\nMuch of your time is spent stalking around areas full of enemies, and these encounters differ quite a bit depending on who you’re up against. Fighting against zombies is stressful — the sound design makes the monsters particularly scary — but killing inhuman creatures never made me feel guilty. People were a different story. Maybe it’s because I played TLOU2 as stealthily as possible, but I never became comfortable with the way Ellie would grab victims from behind, tell them to be quiet, and then stab them in the throat. It felt close and personal in a way I didn’t like, despite seeing it happen dozens, possibly hundreds, of times over the course of the game. There’s a heaviness to the combat. Things happen slowly and deliberately, giving you a chance to consider what you’re doing. You can get by without killing some people, but no matter what, Ellie will kill a lot of people during your time with the game. Even worse were the trained dogs. The game forced me into scenarios where I had no choice but to kill a German Shepherd, using savage weapons like spiked bats and pickaxes. It still makes me uneasy thinking about it.\nViolence in games isn’t anything new. There are plenty of titles that try to use brutality as a way to make players feel something, anything, in a game, whether it’s Hotline Miami or Call of Duty. Much of what I’ve described could be said of the original The Last of Us. What makes the sequel different is the way it makes you question your actions. You don’t just kill people; you see the repercussions.\nThe Last of Us Part II manages this in a few ways. For one, you can see the literal toll the experience takes on Ellie’s body; by the end, she’s a mess of blood and scars and other various ailments. She’s a far cry from the curious teen she was in the first game. But the most powerful part of the story is how it shows both sides of the conflict. For the first half of the game, you see Ellie in the same light as any other video game hero. Sure, she’s killed an unfathomable amount of people, but her pain is understandable. She’s angry and scared and will do almost anything to make that feeling go away. She’s convinced that killing a particular person will ease her guilty conscience. From the perspective of everyone else, though, she’s a terror: a ghost-like killer, somehow making her way into heavily fortified places and leaving a trail of corpses in her wake. The people she’s chasing aren’t monsters; there are times when I hated some of them, but that changed. Things get cloudy. It’s hard to say too much without delving into serious spoiler territory. But by the end, Ellie isn’t the hero she thinks she is. She’s not the same person she starts out as.\nThe process isn’t without issues. There’s some dissonance between what happens in the game and what happens in the cutscenes, for instance. There are times when Ellie will kill a dozen people with little reaction during an action sequence, only to completely lose her composure after a single kill in a scripted cutscene. It’s jarring. The game tries to up the ante in a very forced way by giving almost every NPC a name; if you kill someone, you’ll hear their friends calling for them as soon as they realize they’re missing. Hearing someone call “Shannon!” for the 20th time pulled me out of the experience because it didn’t feel natural. It was like I was being told to care about these people (who, by the way, were trying to kill me).\nThere are other awkward moments when TLOU2 attempts to cover its video game-ness. As beautiful as the levels are, they’re also very clearly designed with a specific purpose in mind; the platforming sections have lots of jumps and things to climb on, whereas combat areas are full of cover and tall grass to obscure Ellie’s movements. You know what’s coming by the layout of the world. Perhaps the most blatant example of this conflict between the game’s desire to immerse you in its world and its inherent game-y nature is the passcodes, a video game staple. In order to open safes or certain locked doors, which you do a lot, Ellie will need to find the corresponding code, which is almost always scrawled down on a nearby piece of paper. This happens so often that it becomes comical; at one point, she even finds a code scrawled in blood on the floor. These aspects aren’t inherently bad, and they’re not unique to TLOU2, but they stand out in a game otherwise so focused on immersion.\nWhen TLOU2 does succeed, which is often, it’s incredible. The moment-to-moment action is tense and brutal. Even though it made me uneasy, I kept pushing ahead to see what would happen next, hoping to find one of those scarce moments of peace. One of the best parts of the game is the boss fights. There are a handful of pivotal conflicts throughout the story, but they don’t play out the way typical video game boss battles do. It’s not about you facing the biggest, baddest enemy there is. (There are some of those, but the most memorable conflicts are different.) Often, you are the aggressor, the more powerful one, exerting your will on someone weaker or in a desperate situation. It turns the tables in a way that makes combat a key storytelling tool.\nThat’s not to say TLOU2 is all gloom. There are light moments amid the dark. Many of these come in the form of flashbacks when you see Ellie and Joel in happier (though still post-apocalyptic) times, like exploring a museum or learning how to play the guitar. The story expertly uses these moments and specific objects to remind you of better times. You’ll see items pop up, like a stuffed giraffe or a collectible coin, that are linked to a specific memory. Even in the midst of a ruined world, these moments still made me smile.\nEllie is also, thankfully, not alone in her journey. Her love interest, Dina, is a charismatic and honest counterpart to Ellie’s more headstrong personality. Watching their relationship deepen is one of the few heartwarming parts of the story. It’s also just nice to have her along for the ride. TLOU2’s world is so dark and oppressive that I felt more comfortable having someone, even a virtual companion, with me. I keenly felt the times when Dina wasn’t there. The same goes for Jesse, another member of the Wyoming commune who tags along for extended parts of the story. The AI-controlled companions aren’t especially useful in combat, but their presence is reassuring nonetheless.\nBut this isn’t a story where Ellie simply gets her revenge and then rides off into the sunset with her girlfriend. The Last of Us Part II does not have a happy ending. Again, it’s hard to say too much without getting into direct spoiler territory, but her single-minded focus on vengeance and her inability to let go cost her a great deal. All of those terrible things she had to do — the decapitated corpses, the bloody hammers, the dead dogs — had a price. And that fact that you’re directly involved in those moments makes it all the more heartbreaking.\nBy the end of a big blockbuster game like this, my mind usually jumps to what will come next or puzzles over some of the mysteries in the story. With The Last of Us Part II, I was glad it was over. Just like Ellie, I was exhausted.\nThe Last of Us Part II launches on the PS4 on June 19th.",

            "text": "Time played: 30 hours\nPlatform: PS4\nThis review contains spoilers for The Last of Us.\nTroy Baker tried to warn us. The voice-over actor, who portrays Joel in The Last of Us series, told us that we weren’t ready for The Last of Us 2 – and he was right. Whether you’ve caught spoilers, watched trailers or just have your own expectations of what The Last of Us 2 will entail, you won't be prepared for the emotional impact of this stunning sequel – and there’s nothing like experiencing it first-hand.\nThe Last of Us 2 is a captivating masterpiece. Not only does it improve on its predecessor, but it trumps every PS4 game that has released this generation. That’s down not only to the emotive and nuanced storytelling, which confidently exceeds the boundaries of what we know games can be, but in the way the game takes a critically-acclaimed formula and elevates it beyond what we could have imagined. And it does so without submitting to the tropes we’re so used to seeing in games.\nBut this exploration of new ground doesn't mean that developer Naughty Dog has strayed from the core elements of the series. Infected still lurk in the shadows of desolate buildings, we're still presented with stunning, lost worlds that only offer pockets of exploration off the beaten track, and we again become emotionally tied to the beautifully developed characters laid before us.\nHowever, with The Last of Us having been released seven years ago, there are plenty of welcome adjustments and additions to modernize what could, in the original game, often be a clunky experience. In The Last of Us 2, combat is more fluid but measured, taking into account not only how a character would approach a situation, but how their physicality informs their strengths and weaknesses, while small but vital improvements to weapon and skill upgrades allow for more control over your playstyle.\nAll these aspects come together to create a sequel that won't disappoint, and which will have you torn but enraptured from cutscene to cutscene. It's been a rocky road to The Last of Us 2, plagued with delays and spoiler leaks, but we can assure you that it’s been worth the wait. If there's one more current-gen game you pick up this year, make it The Last of Us 2.\nThe Last of Us 2 price and release date\n- What is it? The sequel to the critically-acclaimed The Last of Us\n- Release Date? June 19, 2020\n- What can I play it on? PlayStation 4\n- Price? Standard edition is roughly $59.99/£49.99/AU$69\nA history of violence\n- Explores tribalism and revenge, and blurs the lines of morality\n- Further develops the relationships built previously\n- Avoids tropes and stereotypes\nThe Last of Us saw grizzled smuggler Joel tasked with escorting angsty teenager Ellie through a post-apocalyptic United States on a mission to find a militia group known as the Fireflies, who are residing in the Massachusetts State House outside the quarantine zone. During the journey, it comes to light that Ellie is immune to the infection that has ravaged the globe, and that the Fireflies want her so they can attempt to develop a cure. But when it turns out that the Fireflies at that location have been killed, Joel and Ellie travel to Jackson County, Wyoming to enlist the help of Joel's brother Tommy, an ex-Firefly, to locate the group.\nTurns out the Fireflies are in Saint Mary’s Hospital in Salt Lake City, Utah. So, long story short, the pair travel to the hospital, where they find the militia group. However, Marlene, the head of the Fireflies, tells Joel that Ellie is being prepped for surgery and that, in order to find a cure, the infected part of Ellie’s brain must be removed – which would ultimately kill her.\nJoel, who's definitely not on board with this plan, kills all the Fireflies and flees with Elllie, who, on this long journey, has become like a daughter to him. The pair return to Jackson, but Joel lies to Ellie about their escape, telling her that the Fireflies had found other immune people and that they couldn’t find a cure, so she was free to go.\nThe Last of Us 2 picks up the story roughly four years after its predecessor. Ellie and Joel now live alongside Joel's brother Tommy in a settlement in Jackson County, where they've built lives the best they can considering the dangerous and unpredictable state of the world.\nHowever, the relationship between Ellie and Joel is becoming strained, with Ellie having doubts about what really happened with the Fireflies, and Joel struggling to loosen the reigns on the (now grown) woman that he once put his life on the line to protect.\nImmediately we become immersed in the lives of the characters again, even though their relationship has changed drastically from when we left them. Naughty Dog leverages the bond we developed with Joel and Ellie in a way that has you truly feeling the heartbreak on both sides.\nAfter a series of harrowing events, Ellie leaves Jackson in search of revenge, heading to Seattle in pursuit of members of a new militia group that has popped up in place of the Fireflies: the Washington Liberation Front (WLF or Wolves for short).\nWe're not going to tell you any more than that about the subsequent events in this review, because you really do need to experience it first-hand. Every emotional sequence is better played than spoken about – trust us.\nMoral minefield\nWhile The Last of Us primarily explored the relationship between Ellie and Joel, The Last of Us 2 goes far beyond that. You'd be forgiven for thinking this is a simple bloody revenge story, and Naughty Dog could have fallen into that trope.\nInstead, we embark on a story that blurs the lines between the 'good guys' and the 'bad guys', often in a way that's hard to digest, and in which an 'us versus them' mentality becomes much more complicated when everyone is simply out to survive. More connects us than separates us, and Naughty Dog's nuanced storytelling exposes parallels between Ellie and those she sees as the 'other' in subtle but powerful ways.\nPerhaps the hardest pill to swallow is that we're forced to watch Ellie lose herself and what she cares about as a result of a vendetta, while being complicit in her violent actions, and then witness the consequences of those actions for others.\nWhile other games have dipped their toes in the waters of fleshing out 'enemy' characters, providing them with a tragic backstory or some redeeming characteristic, The Last of Us 2 goes a step further. You feel empathy for the other side, and your feelings about the protagonists shift; it's uncomfortable, and a true testament to Naughty Dog's storytelling.\nEvery line in The Last of Us 2 earns its place, carefully considered and carrying emotional weight, with beautifully scripted scenes the inquisitive will stumble upon, but which players in a hurry could miss entirely.\nThis thoughtfulness runs through the veins of the game. We see a degree of diversity that shouldn't be an accomplishment for game in the modern age. We're presented with diverse body types, often atypical of the bikini-clad women we still often see in modern media; a range of ethnicities, avoiding the lazy stereotypes often assigned to them; and there's an exploration of gender and sexuality that doesn't feel forced or disingenuous, and which avoids the pitfalls of familiar tropes.\nWe're not in Jackson anymore...\n- Rewarding pockets of exploration\n- New collectibles\n- An improved and more detailed world\nThe Last of Us 2 shows us in more detail the stunning world we fell in love with the first time round. While you can't explore every location as thoroughly as the curious among us might want to, you'll want to take time to soak up the grim atmosphere, particularly the smaller details, before venturing down the linear path set before you.\nAnd that's not to say there aren't areas to investigate. There are little pockets of exploration available when you need to scavenge resources and collectibles, and often, taking advantage of these can lead to you triggering scenes you could have otherwise missed entirely, and which add layers to the lore and character development. We implore you to take in as much as possible but, as Naughty Dog previously said, there are plenty of scripted scenes you'll probably miss the first time around; this is a game that demands to be played again.\nThe variance in locations will come as a welcome change for those who grew tired of the rehash of desolate apartment buildings on offer in The Last of Us, often varied only by seasons. Instead, there are changes in both the environments you explore and in the ways you can use them to your advantage in combat – which we'll come back to.\nWhile exploring isn't mandatory in The Last of Us 2, players who choose to can expect a more fleshed-out experience. There are artifacts, often in the form of documents, which give further insights into the game's story, while those who love to collect items can pick up trading cards along the way.\nThere's also an occasional safe – with a code likely nearby – that will grant you lots of handy resources. And you're going to want as many of those as you can grab for crafting and upgrades.\nSmall but key improvements\n- More traversal options\n- Improved skill upgrade options\n- Upgrades tailored to your playstyle\nPerhaps our favorite improvement over The Last of Us is to the upgrade system. Where The Last of Us saw Joel collecting supplements to improve specific abilities, The Last of Us 2 offers different skill branches, allowing you to use supplements to upgrade specific branches of abilities such as stealth, precision and explosives. You can unlock new branches by finding training manuals – but these are easy to miss, so keep your wits about you.\nAs Naughty Dog previously warned, resources are in short supply, and so you need to be a bit more picky about what you choose to upgrade than you might be in another game.\nThis also applies to weapon upgrades, which can be unlocked with scavenged materials. Each time you find some of these materials you only get a handful, and each weapon upgrades requires a considerable amount. In addition, workbenches are few and far between – and when you do find one, you may be frustrated to find that you don't have enough materials to upgrade anything.\nWhile it can be difficult to choose what to upgrade, these improvements do allow you to adapt Ellie more to your playstyle. In addition, there are more crafting options generally, including different arrow types, alongside health kits, mines and the ability to make melee weapons deadlier. It really depends how you want to play.\nOutside of crafting and upgrades, traversal has also been improved. You're frequently presented with small puzzles that you must solve in order for your character to climb over walls and access buildings out of reach. To maneuver around these new areas you've got a few more traversal options, such as rare occasions to utilize ropes, a dedicated jump button (finally) and the ability to both crouch and crawl – handy for hiding under vehicles and in long grass. They're small but welcome changes that gives traversal somewhat of a fresh coat of paint.\nPost-apocalyptic arsenal\n- New dodge ability and other combat options\n- More emphasis on calculated combat\n- Combat is fluid and weighted to physicality\nNo two ways about it: the Last of Us 2 is a violent affair. While the violence isn't gratuitous, and plays a part in the overall narrative, you're going to need to get used to the fact that Ellie pretty much slices and dices everyone she encounters.\nBut simply going into combat full-throttle isn't always the best idea in The Last of Us 2. Instead, we found that taking a more calculated, stealthy approach seemed to result in better outcomes – and there are plenty more combat options to facilitate that.\nFor example, in an instance where Ellie was surrounded by bow-wielding Seraphites (a hostile cult, known by the nickname 'Scars'), rather than going in ham-fisted, we took advantage of the tall grass to conceal ourselves, using a bow and arrow to pick off stragglers, and distractions such as bottles to separate individuals from their pack. Popping down a trap mine or two also helps – these essentially work as a remote bomb that blows up when enemies get to close, as they did in the first game – as does Ellie's listening ability (inherited from Joel), with enables you to detect danger even in dimly lit scenarios. The option to stealth-kill enemies is back too, naturally – providing that you can get close enough without being detected.\nBut combat isn't always necessary, and you can use the environment to sneak past enemies, by climbing under cars or through tall grass. It's really up to you how you want to play, in most instances.\nIf you're someone who prefers a bit more action, you can go in guns blazing, but we advise retreating when things get too hairy, as it can be a bit impractical – and potentially fatal – to have to change between ammo types or weapons, or to craft much-needed materials such as health kits, in the middle of a firefight.\nHowever, the new dodge ability means that (if timed right) you can quickly move out of the way of melee attacks before landing your own punishing blow on an enemy. While Ellie is quick and agile, and able to move around often undetected before landing a lethal blow on an unsuspecting enemy, her physicality doesn't lend to heavy-handed close-up combat.\nSo, if an enemy gets too close, it's good to have an upgraded melee weapon on you with which to fend them off, but there are occasions when you'll need to resort to frustrating bouts of button-pushing to loosen yourself from their grasp – something that will be familiar to those who grappled with the Infected in the first game.\nSpeaking of the Infected, while they aren't necessarily the main threat in The Last of Us 2 (that honor goes to humans), they do still pose a threat. While you'll run into your old foes such as Clickers, Bloaters and Runners, there are also a few new Infected species to deal with – including the Shambler, who has a nasty habit of releasing toxic fumes everywhere when it gets too close.\nWhile the Infected are ever present in The Last of Us 2, the main narrative is never about them, and nor do they detract from it; instead they act as a reminder of the type of world you're inhabiting – in case you forgot.\nStrides in accessibility\n- Most aspects of the game can be adjusted to suit player requirements\n- One of the most accessible games to date\n- Over 60 accessibility features\nThe Last of Us 2 is one of the most accessible AAA games we've seen to date, boasting more than 60 accessibility features in total. These are available from the main menu, and offer players the option to adjust a variety of aspects of the game to suit their needs, whether that's implementing text-to-speech and audio cues, visual aids, anti-motion sickness measures, or improving combat accessibility.\nThere are also advanced options that focus on fine-motor impairments and hearing, as well as others to benefit low-vision and blind players. These options are something we believe should be in every game, and to see them in one of the biggest games of 2020 is most welcome. You can learn more about the full range of accessibility options at the PlayStation Blog (opens in new tab).\nVerdict\nIt's hard to put into words why you should play The Last of Us 2 without spoiling the aspects which make it truly great.\nWhile the long-awaited sequel seemingly starts out as a run-of-the-mill revenge tale, it becomes more nuanced, and Naughty Dog's vision begins to come to light. And, while this may take a few hours to become clear, the pacing is perfect for the story that's unfolding.\nThe Last of Us 2 can be a hard pill to swallow sometimes – it's heart-wrenching and sickening on occasion, and it'll put you through the emotional wringer.\nIt's worth noting that this is a much longer game than the first, weighing in at roughly 30 hours, depending on how much exploring you want to partake in. If you're not invested in the story, it could seem like a slog – but for those who are it's almost like two games in one, a threequel and sequel rolled into one fully-fledged story.\nEvery twist and turn is a surprise, and even if you've seen spoilers there are plenty of important plot-points which weren't touched upon in leaks – and what leaks there have been won't detract from your experience. We often found ourselves thinking that we knew what was around the corner, only to be greeted with something entirely different. A lot of that is down to Naughty Dog's (successful) attempts to throw us off the scent, utilizing fake voice-overs and clever edits to paint a different story in trailers and showcases to what you find in the game.\nThe Last of Us 2 may not be for those who haven't played the original, but for those who've grown to love these characters, and this world, it's a more than worthy continuation of a beautifully told story, built upon in ways we didn't imagine, and with all the care we wanted.\n- The Last of Us 2 gate codes: how to open the main gate\n- The Last of Us 2 safe codes: all locations and combinations revealed\n- The Last of Us 2 training manuals: all skill branch locations",

            "text": "The Last of Us Part 2 depicts the future, yet it fails to escape its own past.\nThe sequel feels like a time capsule from 2013, the year the first game was released in real life and the year of the fictional in-game zombie outbreak. The Last of Us Part 2 seems doomed to walk in a well-worn circle, unable to break out of the ever-thickening carapace forming along its skin, just like the victims of the Cordyceps fungus that you fight throughout the game.\nThat is the game’s central problem, and what makes so much of it such a challenge to get through: This is a story about characters who seem unable to learn or grow, and more specifically, unable to consider the humanity of the people they kill. If you already think violence isn’t the answer to many of the world’s problems, the repeated lesson that killing is bad makes the game almost maddening.\nI don’t have any problem empathizing with the people who I’m asked to kill in video games. The Last of Us Part 2 must think I’ll struggle with it, though, since it doles out all sorts of reasons why I should feel regret about the murder spree its characters have embarked upon. But the game’s larger problem is that the characters themselves don’t ever seem able to catch up with me.\nWhat’s worse is that the characterization of Ellie makes it seem like she should also understand this part of the journey. I kept expecting her to grow and turn away from a life of constant violence, but she never picks up on the obvious didactic nature of the game she’s in, even as the designers beat you over the head with a very simple lesson about the value of human life.\nPart 2 is a game about not rising above revenge or violent urges in general. It’s filled with characters dedicated to never seeing the bigger picture beyond themselves. Although the game’s backdrop is a global pandemic, and although it reaches toward the idea of larger injustices by depicting two warring human factions — the cult of the Seraphites, and the militaristic Washington Liberation Front — it is really just a story about a teen girl, her damage, and her apparent belief that the only way to get over that trauma is murder.\nA lot of murder.\nA history of bad decisions\nPart 2 opens as Joel, the gruff protagonist from The Last of Us, tells his brother his darkest secret, the secret that may have doomed humanity. After transporting a teenager named Ellie across the country, and learning along the way that she’s likely the only person immune to the fungus, Joel is told that doctors will use her brain tissue to create a vaccine that will keep all living humans safe, but that the process will kill her. It’s a fascinating moral conundrum: What is the value of one young girl measured against the whole of humanity?\nAnd so Joel murders everyone in the hospital, and saves the unconscious and unaware Ellie, with whom he’s formed an unshakable, paternal bond — a bond that leads him to doom the rest of the planet by saving her life. When Ellie wakes up and asks what happened, Joel lies. The doctor just ran some pointless tests, he tells her. But, he says, there are plenty of other immune people at the hospital (there aren’t), so maybe a vaccine could still happen someday (nope, not now).\nEllie doesn’t seem to believe him, but the credits roll regardless. Joel and the player are left with the unsettling knowledge that a lot of innocent people just died, and that more will fall victim to the fungus and the zombies it creates, all so that one very well-loved teen girl can live. Ellie didn’t have a choice in that decision, and neither did the player. You have to go along with Joel on that one in order to get to the end of the game.\nIt’s a decision that robs the player and Ellie of agency, and the in-game world of a cure, and you better believe it has consequences that didn’t end with the credits on the first game.\nPart 2 puts us into Ellie’s shoes. Finally, she has the chance to make decisions for herself, and will perhaps even learn the truth about what happened at that hospital. That would present another interesting, challenging question for anyone: How do you live knowing that your life was bought by dooming the world? How do you have a healthy, mutually supportive relationship with the man who murdered innocent people just to save you? And is there a way to do so that doesn’t involve going on your very own murder spree?\nThat direction would force the creative team at Naughty Dog to rethink its own parameters, to go beyond the 2013 conceit of The Last of Us, which invited players to question Joel’s motives but nonetheless forced them to enact those murders along with him if they hoped to see the end of the game.\nIt’s an outdated way to criticize the violence of games, and the complicity of those who play them. Remember 2013? That was the year after Hotline Miami came out, a game with themes that would also appear in its contemporaries — Spec Ops: The Line, BioShock Infinite, and The Last of Us. The Last of Us Part 2 even includes a Hotline Miami reference, so the writers were clearly aware of what they were doing here.\nThose were all games that pushed you to feel bad about all the violence that your grizzled white-dude protagonist visited upon others, often for ill-defined reasons, even though the games themselves gave you no choice. Few games had questioned their own body count until that point, but suddenly, in the early 2010s, they were all reacting to the state of in-game stories in the same way: by forcing the player to do things, and then blaming them for doing that thing, even though the player had no other way to proceed.\nThe Last of Us Part 2 gives us a grizzled-beyond-her-years white teen lesbian in the lead role, which is a refreshing change, but the conceit remains the same. Ellie can finally make her own decisions, but just like her dear old surrogate dad, she has a propensity for thinking in the short term and prioritizing her own more animalistic needs for revenge and relief from pain, no matter the human cost. And she’ll be dragging the player along with her, because you have no damn choice but to get homicidal, no matter how much the game wags its finger in your face saying how bad you’re being.\nThe game’s new heroine may give the impression of some larger progressive message, but it’s just a way to change the instruments, if you will. The song itself remains the same.\nThe gorgeous places you’ll visit (to do your murders)\nThe Last of Us Part 2 is the latest game that exists at the cross section of shaky moral ideas and an incredibly high level of craft.\nThe sequel takes place in a post-apocalyptic version of Seattle in the year 2038, long after the city’s famous landmarks have crumbled into disrepair, their exteriors overgrown with lush greenery, their interiors crawling with monsters that hunger for human flesh. Meanwhile, various factions of survivors have cropped up, each of them scrapping and murdering one another for territory and resources. It’s all presented to the player with incredible detail and lifelike animation, creating a visually believable vision of a very dire future in which nature is in control and humans are barely hanging on.\nEllie traipses through sun-dappled forests, rides her horse over glittering streams, and explores moss-covered storefronts and sprawling suburban homes. She finds handwritten notes from humans desperate to scrawl something out before they succumb to their own infection, or get overrun by some warring human faction or the violent, infected monsters. She scribbles notes of her own in a journal as well, including lyrics for original songs she may someday set to music with the guitar she gets early in the game — a gift from Joel.\nThe Last of Us Part 2 luxuriates in depicting the best parts of being alive in a way that’s somewhat rare, even in games with this kind of budget and scope. The game depicts characters falling in love, discovering a well-hidden post-apocalyptic weed stash, and trying to come up with the worst possible puns. Ellie and her best friend (and crush) Dina live in the walled-off area of Jackson County, Wyoming, with a community of human survivors, along with Joel, his brother Tommy, and Dina’s ex-boyfriend Jesse. They have something close to an actual, relatively safe home during a time when such a thing seems almost impossible, and one night they share a very public kiss during a barn dance attended by most of the community.\nThings don’t go well for them after that.\nThat’s because The Last of Us Part 2 also luxuriates in its depictions of pain, suffering, and death. An older man at the barn dance interrupts the girls’ tender moment to spit at Dina, telling her that she’s a “loud-mouthed dyke,” just like Ellie. Now, if Ellie lost her cool and attacked this guy, I’d get it. She doesn’t, however, so I’m not sure what the moment actually accomplishes, other than to remind us that people are still homophobic after the apocalypse.\nInstead, outsiders to Ellie’s “family” are presented as the true danger, and her rampage against them is blood-curdling in its gruesomeness. The previews for the game have already shown some of the graphic violence in store; the one in which the Seraphites try to lynch one of the characters is a good example of the level on which Part 2 operates. It’s going to show you the bad stuff, and it’s going to rub your face in it.\nSome of Ellie’s enemies have trained attack dogs, and it’s hard to avoid killing them. Even if you do manage to avoid it, though, there’s eventually a cutscene with a quick-time event that forces you to kill a dog, to hear the animal’s sharp, confused yelp as you smash her skull in with a metal pipe.\nThat wouldn’t be enough suffering, however. Naughty Dog has to make sure you feel horrible, so you’re later treated to a flashback in which you play fetch with that same dog, scritching her behind her velvety little ears. If Naughty Dog makes you feel bad enough, maybe next time you won’t do ... the thing the game forces you to do?\nThe Last of Us Part 2 delivers these moments of emotional whiplash over and over again. If you ever feel good, victorious, or strong at any moment while playing this game, just know that you will later be feeling very, very bad, and it will happen very, very soon.\nThis effect is mirrored in the game’s combat design, which echoes the story’s themes by repeatedly shoving you away from power, and toward fear, uncertainty, and weakness.\nThe combat in The Last of Us encouraged you to explore an area slowly, scrabbling for resources in abandoned buildings while staying hidden from potential threats. It was always better to attack enemies one at a time, whenever possible. Not much has changed in that respect, although the difficulty spikes are much smoother this time around, making the experience feel a lot less punishing, at least mechanically.\nEllie is a tiny, terrifying gymnast; she’ll leap from a hidden spot in the grass to slice open an enemy’s throat or crowbar their head open, exuding all the cold precision of a lifelong killer. She’s quick and methodical, covering ground in seconds if she has to by jumping, climbing, smashing through windows, squeezing through crevices, and pulling dumpsters up next to rooftops to better traverse less-than-hospitable areas. In houses and structures, she’ll find small caches of ammo and resources that she can cobble together into health packs, trap mines, and so on.\nIdeally, planning will always beat passion, as there’s little more satisfying than setting up a couple of trap mines, throwing a bottle at a horde of infected humans to incite their wrath, and letting them walk right into your death cave. A close second would be nailing a silent headshot with the bow and arrow, or perhaps just sneaking up on a series of clueless, shambling infected people and taking each one’s wallet (that is to say, ammo or bandages) as you go down the line, chuckling all the way to the bank.\nEllie’s abilities strain at the seams whenever you alert a group of enemies to your presence, though, so it’s best to avoid doing so. A petite teen girl like Ellie gets her most methodical murdering done by hiding in the shadows, taking on opponents in turn, as opposed to charging into the fray, guns blazing.\nStill, Part 2 will sometimes railroad you into a battle with a bunch of opponents who’ll come at you simultaneously, or it will throw a couple of big and formidable enemies your way that can’t be beaten through stealth or cleverness. These moments look cool, since they’re splashy set-pieces, but they almost never feel good to play. Not when compared to the moments in which Ellie can plan out her whole attack from the shadows and then unleash it like a trained, capable assassin.\nIt’s the rhythm of the game’s narrative, and how it impacts your tactical choices, that keeps you from ever getting the upper hand. Part 2 includes several flashbacks, and the story is often told out of order, so the version of Ellie you’re controlling may not have access to the weapons or abilities you’re used to.\nThis was annoying at first, but I’d get the hang of whatever new weapons or items I could access within a few minutes. I learned, over time, never to get too comfortable with any of my setups or loadouts before the game took it all away from me. The designers always seemed to want to knock me back down a peg whenever the violence or combat began to feel too good.\nIt makes sense conceptually. This isn’t a world where things are yours to keep; this is a world in which you find what you can and use it for as long as possible before it breaks or you find something better. This frequent shifting ensures that Ellie stays forever in danger.\nNaughty Dog did something fascinating with the game’s difficulty levels, however, giving the player a huge number of options about how they’d like to play. There’s no catch-all “easy mode” or “hard mode,” but rather a collection of settings you can turn up or down.\nYou can adjust your allies’ health, for example, or increase the number of items Ellie finds while scavenging, while still leaving the enemies just as strong. Or you can go in the opposite direction, and decide you want to fight more able enemies and find fewer resources. If one encounter’s giving you trouble, you can bump enemy strength down right then and there, then change it back once you’ve gotten past the area giving you problems. You can save the game, or load an old save, at any time. This ability to almost roll your own difficulty level makes Part 2 significantly easier to play than its predecessor, if you need, or want, it to be.\nIt will, however, be just as emotionally draining. There is no accessibility slider for that.\nMuch of the game’s story revolves around the aftermath of the decision Joel made in the hospital at the end of The Last of Us — not in terms of the big-picture ways in which it affected the entire planet, but rather, the extremely micro ways in which it has affected the personal feelings of Joel, Ellie, and a few other characters, as each of them learns the truth.\nThe problem is that Part 2 becomes torture to play if you already disagree with Joel’s decision, or, heck, even if you just had some doubts about whether it was the right call. “Feel bad about the fact that you’re doing all of this,” the creative team seems to whisper to you, again and again, describing things I already didn’t want Ellie to actually do, but had no choice in if I wanted the game’s story to continue. I was never given any other options, but that didn’t stop the game’s writing for blaming me for its own story. Would the designers feel better, would I be less complicit, if I just refused to buy or play the game at all?\nThis game couldn’t exist if Ellie could just let go, or learn to meditate, or find a cognitive behavioral therapy workbook, or something. This is not a story of healthy humans finding happiness and building a community together, nor is it a story about someone who learns to love and trust others again despite experiencing absurd levels of trauma and loss. It is a story of a young woman who learned the wrong lessons from her surrogate father, and thus believes the ends justify the means. And the means will almost always include inflicting violence on others.\nEllie embraces the role of antihero, just as Joel did, and Naughty Dog makes its queer woman protagonist act just as violent and self-involved as the legions of grizzled straight-white-dude video game protagonists who have preceded her. There’s something that feels off about that straightforward swap here; it’s a missed opportunity to explore how the rage of a marginalized character might take on a different form, and what that form may look and sound like. I felt so much hope at the idea of embodying Ellie instead of Joel in this game, but the entire arc she follows was an arc that I easily could have imagined Joel taking instead of her.\nThat felt disappointing, but not entirely unrealistic. Self-absorbed white teenage lesbians certainly exist, and they’re out there, wearing Chucks and writing mediocre poetry in their journals, just like Ellie does in this game. All the other characters seem like real people, too, even if they might make some shitty choices. But hey, people make shitty choices. It’s kinda what real people do. Part 2’s naturalistic dialogue, bespoke animations, and exploration of subtle body language allow it to cut much deeper when, inevitably, several of these folks die in gruesome, arguably needless ways.\nAnd why? Sure, the real world is brutal and horrific, and this post-apocalyptic fictional world, all the more so. Yet humans can learn and they can change, and that’s what makes a story satisfying, even if it’s a sad one. I wanted these characters to realize and overcome their flaws, to transform in some way, however small. But, again, Part 2 doesn’t tell a story about that. It tells a story about a cycle of violence that no one can escape, and especially not me, the person playing the game. Ellie is trapped, somehow unable to grow, learn, or change, and I’m stuck with her.\nA glimpse at a future worse than our present\nThe writing in The Last of Us Part 2 emphasizes that even the most justified of grievances can grow like a cancer and destroy us, if we let it. That’s the story that the game wants to tell — a story of someone infected by something they don’t have the tools to stop. It makes poetic sense, given that the game is about a brain-eating fungus, as it turns out that Ellie doesn’t need to be infected to turn into an absolutely monstrous killing machine.\nBut when the game gave me more and more information about Ellie’s opponents, painting them as fully realized humans who also deserved to live, the effort felt wasted. I was already convinced that Ellie was handling things the wrong way, and that Joel had made a terrible mistake in the first game. The Last of Us Part 2 didn’t need to force me to kill a dog in order to get me to see that it’s bad to kill dogs. But, of course, it still made me do that. Just to be sure I really got it. I felt annoyed, not reflective. Like, come on, you think I need this much convincing? Does Naughty Dog think we’re all out here killing dogs, unaware that doing so is a horrific cruelty?\nThis story seems to think I need to experience ridiculous levels of virtual violence in order to believe that maybe, just maybe, Ellie should have learned a little more about her enemies’ personal situations and motivations before slamming a baseball bat into their skulls.\nPlaying The Last of Us Part 2, a game that supposes that humans will enact violence upon one another to their dying breaths, is a very strange thing in 2020. Naughty Dog created a world in which people across America react to a massive structural crisis by dividing and disconnecting from others, rather than uniting together to demand something better — not just for themselves, but for the most marginalized people in their communities.\nI see a widespread level of selflessness and an intense care for the preservation of human life in the real 2020, in fact, and an increasingly loud demand for a society that meets that need. Our systems have failed, in large part, but individual people remain strong and kind. Things have rarely been worse, but there is hope to be found in the actions of average folks fighting to do the right thing. We don’t need a video game to rub our noses in hatred and violence to know that other people who are just trying to survive aren’t the real enemy.\nThe Last of Us Part 2 depicts individual people who are instead ruthless, capable, yet self-absorbed, and whose perception of violence is limited to how it affects them and their chosen family members. They are almost unbelievably unable to see the bigger picture. Part 2 ends up feeling needlessly bleak, at a time when a nihilistic worldview has perhaps never been less attractive. Its characters are surviving, but they’re not learning, and they’re certainly not making anything better.\nMaybe the most surprising thing that The Last of Us Part 2 offered me was the surety that, while the game was made with great skill and craft, we are actually much, much better than Naughty Dog thinks we are.\nThe Last of Us Part 2 will be released June 19 on PlayStation 4.

            "text": "‘Before you embark on a journey of revenge, dig two graves.” So goes the saying popularly (if spuriously) attributed to Confucius – a proverbial truth that The Last of Us Part II explores, unflinchingly and sometimes gruesomely, for 30 hours. It is difficult to explain how exactly it does this without robbing players of the chance to experience it for themselves, but I will say this: no video game has ever gone to these lengths to humanise the enemy, or to interrogate the violence that it asks the player to perform.\nWe play as Ellie, a 19-year-old born a few years after a fungal illness devastated human civilisation, turning the afflicted into shambling, deformed husks and the world’s cities into overgrown relics. Since the events of The Last of Us (2013), she has been living in a stable community of survivors, making friends, learning the guitar, kissing girls at dances. But a traumatic event drives her to leave the relative safety of Jackson on a revenge mission that takes her to the remains of Seattle.\nThe city has been ravaged first by the military, then by the infected, and finally by nature. Vegetation grows through the cars rooted to the highway and rusting skyscrapers preside over ominously empty streets. Abandoned storefronts and apartment buildings might hide notes from doomed former residents, scrap with which to fix up Ellie’s weapons or craft improvised explosives and health kits – or dormant infected ready to tear her to bits. Before long, she comes into contact with the remaining human residents of the city: the remnants of a well-equipped militia and the unsettling followers of a brutal cult, whistling creepily to each other as they hunt Ellie down.\nThere is shooting and molotov cocktails, and even a flamethrower at one point, but there is also an awful lot of hiding, running away, and creeping through long grass, desperately hoping not to be found. This isn’t a game that makes you feel powerful. Ellie can take care of herself, but I spent much of this game feeling horribly imperilled. It is usually difficult but possible to sneak past undetected or run away from fights, but good luck finding the best paths through knots of soldiers or navigating a subway station full of zombies on your first try.\nMore often, I was forced into desperate, scrabbling combat, trying not to get overwhelmed, wasting bullets in a panic. Very occasionally this felt slightly farcical; once I was stuck hiding on top of a shipping container, having exhausted all my ammo for every weapon, waiting for an opening to dash to the door I needed to get through to end the scene. But more often it feels intense and dramatic; immense relief descended on me every time I made it through a scene unscathed. This game pulls the occasional horror trick on you, sending you falling through a floor into a dark basement full of zombies or confronting you with horrendous Resident Evil-inspired new variants on the infected, but the scariest parts for me were when I was probing through seemingly empty buildings, or hiding in a corner praying that guard dogs wouldn’t sniff me out.\nThe violence is extreme, sometimes uncomfortable, and consequential. It’s hard to feel too bad for shooting, bludgeoning or blowing up the grotesque and suffering infected as they run at you, gasping, moaning and making hideous clicking noises, but when Ellie is choking a struggling human enemy, grim-faced, it’s not pleasant to watch. In video games we are accustomed to an action-movie suspension of disbelief in relation to body counts, and to a straightforward moral assumption that the player characters whose perspective we inhabit are the goodies, and that the people on the other side of the aiming reticle are the baddies. The Last of Us Part II challenges both of these assumptions.\nThis isn’t a straightforward violence-is-bad story. As in most zombie fiction, violence is baked into this world and our interactions with it. Instead, it’s about the motivations for that violence, the endless cycles of retribution that pull individuals or whole populations down into destructive spirals, and what it takes to break those cycles. There were parts of it that I had to endure rather than enjoy, furious or disgusted by what characters were doing – and, by extension, by what I was doing. There will be many players who don’t like where this story takes them, but by God, it’s emotionally effective. I was obsessed with it from the first hour, and now that I’ve finished it, I haven’t been able to stop thinking about it for days.\nThis effectiveness is the result of some fine acting from The Last of Us Part II’s human stars, and the immense technical skill on show in translating those performances to the screen. Never for a moment did the awareness that I was watching 3D models interact with each other intrude on my experience of this story. You can see every scar, scratch and micro-expression on their faces, read their body language, hear the venom or fear or conflict in their voices – and these characters are, not incidentally, the most diverse set to feature in a game as big as this. It is rare in games for the moments when you’re not playing to be as memorable as those when you are.\nThe writing is extremely good, not only the dialogue but also the masterful use of flashbacks and other narrative devices to flesh out personalities and motivations, having you revisit scenes and places in new contexts that make you see things differently. Chases, shootouts and horribly tense forays through long-abandoned, zombie-infested buildings are balanced with quiet (or quietly devastating) scenes where all you do is talk and look around. The game’s graphical and technical accomplishments are just as key to its power: everything from the animation to the scene-setting, every building and battered piece of furniture and tiny trinket that makes up this post-apocalyptic Americana, is meticulous and astounding.\nThis is an unlikely comparison, but now that I’ve had some time to absorb The Last of Us Part II, it reminds me thematically of Shadow of the Colossus, another game about how consuming grief and anger can be. I was similarly poleaxed by that game’s clever manipulation of the player’s power, the way it also used the language of video games to make you think twice about your actions. The Last of Us Part II is another story that could only work as a game, the kind of challenging, groundbreaking work that comes along two or three times a decade.\nThe Last of Us Part II is out on 19 June; £49.99.",

            "text": "‘The Last of Us Part II’ Is a Dark Game for a Dark Time\nSet in a violent, tribal, pandemic-ravaged world, the long-awaited Naughty Dog epic will leave you damaged — and awed.\nSupported by\nAt the climax of The Last of Us, a blockbuster 2013 video game that is superficially about a zombie-fungus apocalypse but is really about the lengths a parent will go to protect a child, you are forced to kill a doctor. This doctor is not a threat. He stands there limply, holding a scalpel, so technically he’s not unarmed — but you’ve got a gun and the gameplay has made it clear, after hours of close fighting, that your character could subdue the man peacefully if he wanted.\nVideo games are constructed around choice, and when I played the game for the first time, I expected one here. A lot of games, including highly ambitious ones, present you at various points with a kill-the-guy/don’t-kill-the-guy binary, allowing you to shape at least a part of your character’s morality. At this juncture of The Last of Us, however, there was nothing but a glaring lack of alternatives. The only way to move the story forward — and reach an ending in which I’d already invested 14 emotionally debilitating hours — was to murder the pleading doctor while his colleagues screamed “No!” and called me an animal.\nThe sequence helped establish The Last of Us as one of the most successful games in the medium’s history, a high-water mark of both artistic achievement and commercial viability. The title sold more than 17 million copies, won numerous Game of the Year awards, and is being developed into an HBO series.\nNow, seven years later, a sequel is debuting under a staggering load of expectations. The Last of Us Part II goes on sale Friday, needing to meet critics’ high standards and appeal to an audience broad enough to recoup hundreds of millions of dollars in production costs. If the game succeeds, it would help establish The Last of Us as an enduring and lucrative pop culture franchise.\nFor Naughty Dog, the Sony-owned studio behind the series, the safe thing to do from a financial standpoint would have been to continue the first game’s story in a predictable way that kept fans happy, as the makers of Marvel and Star Wars movies have done so profitably. But The Last of Us Part II does nothing of the sort. (Warning: Stop reading here if you want to know nothing about its plot.) Instead, the punishingly bleak sequel kills off the original’s main character and turns the secondary hero into a villain. It takes violence to a level that is uncomfortable even by the standards of video games, and seemingly does everything in its power to make gamers feel bad about the act of playing it.\nRisky creative decisions like these are part of how Naughty Dog — which is based in Santa Monica, Calif., and also develops the treasure-hunting series Uncharted — has established itself as gaming’s pre-eminent producer of cinematic, story-based titles. This commitment to Hollywood-grade, linear narrative sets the company apart in an industry that is otherwise trending toward games based on repetitive online competition (such as Fortnite) or endlessly explorable open-world “sandboxes” (like the Grand Theft Auto franchise). The approach entails certain pressures and risks. While its games are in development, Naughty Dog tries to erect a wall of secrecy around the plots — holding reviewers to tight nondisclosure agreements and even deceiving fans with misdirection — until everything is revealed through a clean and choreographed release.\nThe path to today’s unveiling, though, has been anything but controlled. First, The Last of Us Part II missed its February target date because it wasn’t ready; then, the coronavirus prompted a second delay. For the studio, the global pandemic was actually a minor issue compared with what happened next. In late April, someone leaked a video spoiling major plot points, including the murder of the original title’s main character, who’s beaten to death by a muscular woman. Some fans, erroneously assuming the killer to be transgender, pelted the game’s creators with putrid tweets and death threats.\nChaotic though the process has been, having the misogynistic politics of Gamergate in the mix has only contributed to the sense that The Last of Us Part II is premiering with eerily perfect timing. The game’s story is about entrenched tribalism in a world undone by a global pandemic. As you play the game, walking through empty spaces, scavenging for items that used to be commonplace, listening to characters describe the fall of society with a sense of loss, you feel emotionally in sync.\nEven if you don’t play the title, you’ll probably start to hear about it. Craig Mazin, the creator of the 2019 mini-series “Chernobyl,” had his pick of projects to pursue after that series won 10 Emmys; he decided to develop The Last of Us for HBO based largely on the poignant brutality of its ending. “I’ve never experienced anything that viscerally made me question the value of love,” he said.\nMr. Mazin recently played an advance copy of The Last of Us Part II, and is now working through it a second time. He’s biased, of course, but in his estimation the sequel’s finale is on par with the original. “I’m still thinking about that ending,” he said. “There are endings where you think ‘Well, that’s perfect,’ and that’s that. And then there are endings that make you start to think about your relationship with the character and — really — your relationship with narrative itself.”\nMost of the early reviews from critics are similarly awed. The Last of Us Part II carries a 95 rating on Metacritic, with cautions like “uncomfortable” and “misery simulator” giving way to pronouncements like “one of best video games ever made.”\nA cheap sensation turned art\nThe Last of Us and its sequel belong to a gaming genre known as “survival/horror.” You spend a lot of time sneaking through dark rooms while enemies lurk in the shadows and suspenseful music thumps in your ears. Assailants pop out from corners; zombies tear at faces and rip out necks. The action is startling and stressful, flushing the body with adrenaline to a degree that you feel like you’re living inside an “Alien” movie.\nThe premise of the first game is that in September 2013, a strain of the Cordyceps fungus, a real-life organism that can take over the bodies and minds of ants, jumps to humans. People who get infected are disfigured and hungry for flesh; billions die and society crumbles. Many of the game’s missions are built around a search for some suddenly precious item — a gallon of gas, a medical kit. Bullets are scanty and your character is usually outnumbered in battle, so you expend a lot of effort sneaking up on enemies and conserving resources with clandestine stabbings.\nVideo games operate through what people in the industry call mechanics — the actions that allow a player to navigate the world and give a game its logic and structure. Shooting enemies, sneaking past guards, crafting Molotov cocktails, searching for items with which to level up: These are all mechanics, and they work by creating an emotional response, similar to the dopamine rush of social media, that compels people to spend hours immersed in a digital realm.\nAnyone who has gobbled up pellets in Pac-Man is familiar with this thrill. For the most part, it’s a cheap sensation, guided by stress and the meaningless accrual of points. In the best games, however, the ones that get talked about as art, mechanics enhance the story and deepen the emotional pull.\nThis does not have to be complicated. Braid, a basic two-dimensional game by the designer Jonathan Blow, employs a time-manipulation mechanic in which players solve puzzles by rewinding the game and undoing their deaths, to tell a story about regret and forgiveness. Playing it, you feel connected, however abstractly, to the universal desire to replay life with the benefit of hindsight.\nAs games have gotten more sophisticated, fans have tended to accept that violence is part of the medium — but they have also begun expecting options to avoid bloodshed, or at least have it make artistic sense. Naughty Dog’s Uncharted series, about an Indiana Jones-like figure who knows a ton of history and goes on treasure quests, has been criticized for its “ludonarrative dissonance” — that is, the story and characters don’t match the action. It makes no sense, players have argued, to have a protagonist presented as a charming Everyman in cutscenes (pre-recorded, unplayable video clips), and then require him to blithely murder thousands of people when you’re holding the controller.\nWith The Last of Us games, the studio gets past this critique by making violence seem logical. Playing them, you don’t question why the characters kill so often because the postapocalyptic setting is a place where people literally eat each other to survive.\nThis is not a purely aesthetic exercise. Video game content, meaning physical and downloaded games, generated $35.4 billion in U.S. revenue last year, according to NPD Group. This means world-building is the same as franchise-building. And since so many of these franchises involve killing things, what sets Naughty Dog apart — the reason it can spend years creating enveloping narratives that adapt well to prestige TV — is that its stories are regarded as the thinking person’s gore.\nIn the first installment, you play as Joel Miller, a hardened smuggler whose daughter died in the fungus outbreak. His task is to ferry across the country a 14-year-old girl named Ellie, who is immune to the pathogen and holds the key to a vaccine. Joel kills zombies and tortures cannibals, and at first he seems like a run-of-the-mill butcher of the sort you can find in any number of other games.\nWhat makes Joel different, and The Last of Us popular, is the relationship he builds with Ellie. In between the splatter is a genuinely affecting story of a closed-off man who allows the void of his daughter’s death to be filled, such that when you kill people as Joel, you don’t feel like a psychopath. You feel like a protective dad.\nEach working diligently to kill the other\nThe Last of Us Part II is about hate, using stories of revenge as an extended metaphor about cycles of violence. The game does this through a novel device that Naughty Dog took extreme pains to keep quiet, prohibiting journalists from mentioning it in advance reviews even after those April hackers revealed it: You play the game as a pair of mortal enemies, switching sides and perspectives.\nNeil Druckmann, The Last of Us II’s director and Naughty Dog’s chief creative force, was born in Israel in 1978 and lived in the West Bank as a child before immigrating to Miami. The influence is clear. The sequel begins with a paramilitary named Abby killing Joel with a golf club for reasons that aren’t made clear. This prompts Ellie to find Abby and avenge Joel’s death. The backdrop is a long-running conflict between two tribes that war over land and have recently seen a cease-fire agreement break down. Each side blames the other for firing the first shot.\nMr. Druckmann co-wrote the game with Halley Gross, a screenwriter who has worked on HBO’s “Westworld.” He said the story was inspired by a video he saw around 2000, in which two Israeli reservists were killed in Ramallah while a crowd cheered. “I was intrigued-slash-horrified how easily my mind was able to tip into these dark, violent thoughts, and I realized that’s not just me — that’s universal,” he said in an interview.\nAt some point, Mr. Druckmann became enamored with the conceit of having players inhabit two enemies and experience the same story from opposing perspectives. Halfway through The Last of Us Part II, players switch from Ellie to Abby, and discover that the latter has sound reasons for revenge. As the game progresses, the appeals to empathy are steadily amped up, introducing you to Abby’s friends and family, using conversations and extended flashbacks to plunge you deep inside their stories. One of the more cruel twists of viewpoint is a sequence in which you stab a vicious dog as Ellie and soon find yourself playing fetch with the animal as Abby.\nWhereas the first game uses carnage to strengthen your character’s relationship with a digital teenager, The Last of Us Part II stuffs you with pain and guilt, making you commit heinous acts as one person, then experience the repercussions as another. This is made even more exhausting by a battery of digital tricks that make you feel absolutely horrible about what you’re doing. From the sound of blood leaving the body to characters who grunt “No” just before you do what they’re begging you not to do, the violence is detailed and graphic. Even the normally anonymous hordes that you destroy between plot points are made semi-human by Naughty Dog’s insistence on giving every single one of them a name, so that whenever you down an enemy, others cry out to them individually — “Jack!” “Evie!” — as they realize a friend is gone.\nIn its best moments, The Last of Us Part II is a feat of empathetic storytelling. Over the course of the narrative, I really did go from hating the Abby character to understanding her motivations and eventually flat-out rooting for her. But by forcing you to act out both characters’ atrocities and reconcile with all the death you’ve inflicted, the game ends up in territory that is fairly cynical.\nLeigh Alexander, a former gaming journalist who co-founded Red Queens, an independent studio based in the United Kingdom, argues that this level of darkness is a natural result of big-budget game studios’ twin constraints: They aspire to tell deeper stories, but these stories are still tethered to the mechanics of a weapon. Thus, it’s become a race to the darkest bottom in which each new release features a world more evil than the last, and each new antihero more nihilistic than the one before them.\n“The only way to make stories about violence more realistic is to make them grueling,” Ms. Alexander said. “And I can’t see the spirit of play in there.”\nThe coronavirus era’s twisted cousin\nBetween battles, The Last of Us Part II has players explore post-apocalyptic settings, collecting weapons and supplies. It’s during these breaks in action — which can last an hour or more, depending on how much exploring you do — when The Last of Us Part II feels most like the coronavirus era’s twisted cousin. As the music chilled out and battle noise quieted, I found myself wandering around the desolate streets, admiring photorealistic scenes of nature reclaiming Seattle.\nThere are boarded restaurants and empty conference rooms, and characters routinely remark on the world as it used to be. In one scene, a character asks another what the vast halls of an aquarium must have felt like packed with kids. In another, Ellie and a friend walk through the remnants of a comic book convention. Not all of this is sad: One of the game’s sweeter scenes is a moment where Ellie plays her girlfriend Dina a song with a guitar she finds in an abandoned music store.\nNaughty Dog revealed Ellie’s sexuality in 2014, in a short interstitial game called The Last of Us: Left Behind. Social media bottom-dwellers protested in the usual manner of bombarding Mr. Druckmann’s Twitter account with bigotry and making YouTube videos accusing him of a “social justice warrior” agenda. When one fan asked Mr. Druckmann to leave his personal politics out of his games, he replied: “No can do.”\nAny thought that he would back away from the issue in the second game was dispensed by a 2018 game trailer that showed a passionate kiss between Ellie and Dina. Gay characters are not new to games — hundreds of independent titles explore themes of sexuality and gender identity — but Ellie stands out because she is the protagonist of an aggressive, big-budget game aimed at the medium’s core male audience.\n“It has L.G.B.T. representation at the center of the game,” said Bonnie Ruberg, a professor of film and media studies at the University of California, Irvine. “On the business side, it represents at least one company’s willingness to step up and say, ‘We are going to put the money and time into this representation.’ Because historically, that’s the line studios use to avoid it — they say, ‘These games are so expensive to make that we don’t want to alienate our core player base.’”\nBottling up the plot\nBetween work delays, pandemic delays, spoilers and a March investigation by the gaming site Kotaku that called out the company’s punishing culture of overwork, Naughty Dog has been the subject of so much bad news that The Onion created a satirical running narrative of its problems. Mr. Druckmann said he’s unconcerned about any of this undermining sales, and the data seems to be on his side. Sony recently announced that pre-orders were unaffected by the leak, the title is No. 1 on Amazon’s video game best-seller list, and analysts are projecting that eventually, The Last of Us Part II will rank among the most successful games ever released for the PlayStation 4 console.\nMr. Druckmann said that Sony’s marketing department would have preferred less secrecy before launch so that consumers would have more details to be excited about. But as a writer, he said, he had decided it was more fun to keep things hidden, bottling up the plot until that big day of release when everyone rushes to find out what happens at once. “It was extremely frustrating and demoralizing,” he said of the leak.\nIn the days after the spoiler video was uploaded, he reminded himself of the thing that anyone who’s tried to expound on a game to a friend eventually realizes: The good ones are so immersive that there’s really no way to explain them, much less spoil them, because they must be played to be understood. Becoming Ellie, and then Abby, will leave you surprised, frustrated, challenged and hurt — maybe even damaged. It isn’t much fun, but neither are sad movies. The ones that endure are the ones you don’t forget.\nAdvertisement",

            "text": "The Last of Us Part 2: The most emotionally corrosive video game ever\nInverse Score: 8/10\n“Fuckin’ video games,” a character sighs halfway through Naughty Dog’s The Last of Us Part II.\nOne can’t help but agree with the exasperated, self-aware sentiment. Fuckin’ video games indeed.\nThe Last of Us 2 is a game that demands conflicted feelings. It engenders adoration for the brilliant graphics, compelling acting, and substantial gameplay. But the story made me feel utterly miserable, even if I really admire it.\nThe least subtle game in history, The Last of Us 2 feels like a golf club to the head. The game that's caused stress nightmares made me love its ambition, but I sort of hate it for the emotional labor involved.\nExtensive spoilers for The Last of Us and The Last of Us Part II follow.\nIn the first Last of Us, protagonists Joel and Ellie feel like real people in a dismal world where the Cordyceps brain infection wiped out most of the population. Society has crumbled. Zombies are everywhere. Ellie, who’s immune to the virus, is the key to developing a vaccine, but the vaccine would kill her. So Joel murders dozens of people to save Ellie. The game doesn’t cast judgment on his choice, so we’re left to answer this moral question ourselves: Did Joel do the right thing?\nThe price we all pay for Joel’s sentiment is The Last of Us Part II, which metes out the consequences of the first game’s perfect ending.\nA brilliant, surprising story with hollow characters\nThe sequel steps back into this world five years later when a moody, adult Ellie embarks on a quest for revenge to the ruins of Seattle after a new character named Abby murders Joel with a golf club while Ellie is forced to watch.\nThe Last of Us 2 starts out as a revenge story but spends an exhausting 24 hours of gameplay trying to convince us that this is not supposed to be fun. Joel killed Abby's father at the end of the first game, and then we’re asked to play as Abby for the second half of this one. Last of Us 2 is her revenge story in equal measure.\nThese shocking, broad strokes were the focus of a devastating batch of leaks that surfaced in April. At face value, it seems infuriating: A total stranger kills our hero from the first game, and then we’re supposed to play as her for 12 hours!?\nThose seemingly divisive narrative choices produce a result that’s brilliant. Even if the parallels drawn between these characters are about as subtle as Abby’s 7-iron, they’re still artfully done.\nOver the course of the game, Ellie grows more enraged. She’ll later growl obscenities like “Eat shit…!” at a woman whose throat she’s just slit. Ellie is so consumed by violent revenge that she’d blindly risk, and spend, the lives of her friends.\nHailing from a Seattle community where everyone is supremely kind, particularly to dogs, Abby embarks on an overlapping adventure where an innocent teenager helps quell her simmering rage and restore a sense of humanity. We’re meant to see the obvious mirror to Joel and Ellie’s dynamic in The Last of Us. Abby is also a super-buff badass who spent three solid years power-lifting in the Seahawks’ workout room. (Really. The Washington Liberation Front is headquartered in a stadium.)\nBoth of these women are enraged by the trauma that's happened to them in life, justifiably so.\nThe big picture gets more compelling the longer you stare it, but the characters seem to lose depth as this franchise continues.\nEllie, Joel, and other Last of Us characters feel “real” because of their nuanced array of emotions. Their decisions are sometimes astonishing, but they’re always believable. Most characters in The Last of Us 2 feel one-note by comparison. Even if characters look more realistic than ever, they often don’t feel like it.\nEngaging gameplay, short on innovation\nThe Last of Us 2 has developer Naughty Dog’s signature polish, but it all feels a bit outdated despite the beauty rendered in the pixels. There’s very little that feels innovative in the gameplay.\nThere are new guns, characters, weapons, and enemies to fight. But the core loop of looting and shooting before squeezing through some crack in the wall gets repetitive when trapped on the railroaded plot. Last of Us 2 is a pretty game, but it by the end, you just want it to be over.\nThere are moments that represent a leap forward for video game storytelling, even for a AAA title. For instance, you’ll spend much of Ellie’s first day in Seattle entirely on horseback, exploring a small “open-world” area of the city. You’re given a map and the freedom to wander, which felt like a genuine surprise. There are ruins to be combed through, letters and notes full of lore to discover, and even a shotgun tucked away in a bank.\nIt’s a shame that after a few short hours of exploring, your horse is blown to smithereens by a landmine. Thus ends the wandering.\nHad The Last of Us Part 2 committed to an open-world concept or more diversity in the action sequences, or better characterization, it may have truly been a perfect game. Naughty Dog plays it a bit too safe, investing all the creative energy into the plot.\nThis meditation on the cycle of violence is just too heavy\nGame Director Neil Druckmann has repeatedly said The Last of Us 2 is “about the cycle of violence” and intends to leave the player feeling “repulsed by some of the violence they are committing themselves.” The sense of horror we feel is exacerbated when the leveled-up graphics and state-of-the-art motion capture work make the violence that much more visceral.\nExperiencing this world through Ellie and Abby’s dual perspectives challenges us to think more deeply about the violence we perpetuate in video games. By slowly revealing Abby’s backstory as an unapologetic, brave woman, we sympathize with the enemy, more so in the moments where The Last of Us 2 gives a name and a history for almost every single enemy — even the dogs.\nSimilar to stories like Star Wars: The Last Jedi that buck fan expectations and tear down our heroes, The Last of Us 2 drags players outside of their comfort zones so they can grow and see the world from more diverse perspectives.\nEven when The Last Of Us 2 makes you uncomfortable, it’s worthwhile.\nMost of the game’s harshest critics discuss unlikable characters unable to grow or reckon with the consequences of their actions. That’s frustrating when we remember the nuance of the first game, where compelling character arcs made Joel and Ellie feel larger than life. Instead of taking this approach to character arcs, Part 2’s narrative arc forces us to grow and change instead.\nThis unconventional narrative winds up feeling like a cautionary tale or parable about the cycle of violence that’s so exhaustive and repetitive in its refrain that I can’t help but wonder: Is the journey worth it?\nThe answer is yes, because The Last of Us 2 is a must-play game, but you’ll probably only want to play it once. 8/10.\nINVERSE VIDEO GAME REVIEW ETHOS: When it comes to video games, Inverse values a few qualities that other sites may not. For instance, we care about hours over money. Many new AAA games have similar costs, which is why we value the experience of playing more than price comparisons. We don’t value grinding and fetch quests as much as games that make the most out of every level. We also care about the in-game narrative more than most. If the world of a video game is rich enough to foster sociological theories about its government and character backstories, it’s a game we won’t be able to stop thinking about, no matter its price or popularity. We won’t punch down. We won’t evaluate an indie game in the same way we will evaluate a AAA game that’s produced by a team of thousands. We review games based on what’s available in our consoles at the time. For instance, we won’t hold it against a video game if its online mode isn’t perfect at launch. And finally, we have very little tolerance for junk science. (Magic is always OK.)",

            "text": "The Last of Us Part 2 Review\nVerdict\nThe Last of Us Part 2 is a masterful swansong for the PlayStation 4, and arguably the finest, most accomplished project Naughty Dog has ever embarked on. It’s far more than a traditional sequel, taking the original’s core message and expanding upon in ways that will be looked back on as brave, ambitious and undeniably controversial.\nPros\n- A deep story that builds upon the original\n- Ellie’s story and the tales of those around her are all touching and nuanced\n- Combat is viciously satisfying\n- Sets a new benchmark for diverse representation in gaming blockbusters\nCons\n- Small parts of campaign could have been paced more gracefully\n- Certain villains could have benefitted from further development\nKey Specifications\n- Review Price: £49.99\n- Release Date: June 19, 2020\n- Platform: PS4\n- Developer: Naughty Dog\n- Genre: Action\nBut this resolution was pushed aside when Naughty Dog announced a sequel, which would be a direct continuation of the original’s events. The gates of a tale with ambiguous closure were now blown wide open, with Joel and Ellie once again placed at the forefront. To my jubilant surprise, it more than exceeds expectations, subverting storytelling conventions to tell a broad, emotional story that is the best Naughty Dog has ever produced.\nRelated: Best PS4 Games\nThe Last of Us Part 2 opens in the idyllic future we all dreamed of after the first game. It’s been five years, and the two have forged a new life in the picturesque mountains of Jackson, Wyoming. Relationships and routines have been formed as Joel reconnects with his family and Ellie becomes more confident in herself as a fledgling artist amongst a new circle of friends.\nBut reasons you’ll come to uncover have caused them to drift apart, a void they’re both afraid can never be filled. From here their relationship is analysed in some fascinating ways, bonds we once thought sacred are torn apart and scrutinised in ways that force you to contextualise actions previously set in stone. I won’t delve into any spoilers here, but it’s beautifully depicted in a way that will pluck at your heartstrings with the finesse of a machete.\nThe core narrative thrust is brought into the limelight after Ellie witnesses a traumatic, life-altering event, placing our heroine on a path for revenge that will force her to confront her past and contemplate whether or not this reckless cycle of violence will truly bring her happiness, or if she is simply carving an inevitable monument to her own self-destruction.\nEven with lovers and friends helping her along the way, I began to question her actions and whether I, as the player, was complicit in all this even when I wanted to put down the controller and walk away from it all. Ellie deals in indiscriminate violence to track down those who wronged her, even when the human beings she dispatches are humanised with journals scattered across the map and dialogue that cements their own existence in this world.\nRelated: Ghosts of Tsushima\nThe moral dichotomy between my own feelings and Ellie’s thirst for vengeance were constantly echoed as the story moves forward, forcing me to analyse the relationship I’ve built with this character and what she truly believes in. I’ve never had a blockbuster challenge me like this before, presenting a quandary that concludes in one of the greatest final acts the medium has ever seen.\nI’m forbidden from delving too deep in this review, but rest assured that The Last of Us 2 houses so many surprises, even with the controversial leaks that have dominated online discourse in recent months. Much like Uncharted 4: A Thief’s End before it, Naughty Dog has filled marketing and trailers with red herrings so devious that even the most hardened fans of the original won’t see them coming.\nThe relationship between Ellie and Dina, the latter being our heroine’s primary love interest, is touching and realistic throughout the campaign. While her sexuaity was explored briefly in Left Behind, and sadly resulted in the death of her childhood sweetheart, The Last of Us 2 does a far better job of portraying queer relationships as a subject of normality.\nEllie is a young woman, and we see her struggling with her identity throughout the campaign as she awkwardly discusses crushes with Joel and deals with roadblocks many of us are familiar with in life. It’s a smultzy, touching slither of romance in a story oftentimes devoid of hope, and it’s worth stepping back and admiring these moments for what they are – morsels of happiness these characters cling onto while waiting for the next tragedy to strike.\nLGBT representation throughout The Last of Us 2 sets a new benchmark, especially in the AAA space, and Naughty Dog should be commended for it. I will admit it is somewhat exhausting to see a post-apocalyptic hellscape more accepting of queer identities than some parts of modern society, but perhaps this hard reset of society has put aside prejudices that once held us back. If the end of the world ever comes, at least we’ve got that to look forward to.\nRelated: Cyberpunk 2077\nIf the brutality of its predecessor left you squeamish, The Last of Us 2 will not be an easy pill to swallow. It’s drenched in violence both literally and figuratively, challenging you to overcome its vicious depiction of human suffering through performing it yourself and realising where the limits lay. Armed with a switchblade, Ellie can swiftly murder any poor soul or corrupt infected that crosses her path. That is, so long as she moves quietly enough.\nStealth is a far more viable tactic this time around, with the majority of environments awash with overgrown foliage you can dive into, crawling past mercenaries and infected waiting for the perfect moment to strike. Some encounters can be avoided entirely, leaving your adversaries to search fruitlessly for a ghost that has long passed them by. Being spotted is a common occurrence though, so you’ll need to emerge from your shrubbery fortress and face the music.\nFortunately, Ellie is more than capable of murdering everything in her path. Perhaps too capable. Pulling the trigger of firearms results in a bloody explosion of flying body parts and gut-wrenching screams, while each bout of melee combat feels like a genuine fight for survival. Stepping over enemies as they writhe in pain, clutching the aching wounds where their limbs used to be never fails to shake your resolve, purposefully gratuitous in a way that services the game’s wider themes.\nThe areas you’ll explore across Downtown Seattle are abundant in their variety, embracing a sense of verticality where Ellie can use her increased range of movement to deal with threats from above, below and on a level playing field. This is the best combat system Naughty Dog has ever created, possessing a level of impactful weight which makes every fight feel like a multifaceted triumph, with so many tools at your disposal that simply experimenting with them is a joy.\nRelated: Horizon Zero Dawn 2\nGeneral flow remains largely unchanged when compared to the original, it’s simply been enhanced and refined in a way that will honestly make it difficult to return to Joel and Ellie’s fledgling effort without feeling like something is missing. Crafting items such as traps, arrows and healing kits in real-time adds a venerable level of tension as you desperately search for resources in the heat of battle. On hard difficulty, I was always on the cusp of having nothing to defend myself, having to use everything I had to make it out alive.\nNaughty Dog is a master of knowing when to give the player room to breathe, putting aside violence in favour of quieter, more contemplative moments that serve the narrative. The Last of Us 2 is full of such glimpses into its characters’ lives, pulling from the past, present and future to showcase what makes their fight for survival so important. You’ll go from adoring certain characters to absolutely despising them, or perhaps even the opposite, since you’re expected to draw your own conclusions and think about what isn’t shown.\nYears have passed since we last spent time with Joel and Ellie, and throughout the campaign you only view small snapshots from the months they’ve spent building a new life, trying desperately to leave the past behind while being inexplicably defined by it. It’s a bittersweet affair, and one that had me crying, laughing and even shouting at the screen in hopeless desperation. I can’t think of a blockbuster that has twisted my emotions like this, leaving me eager to discuss its thematic importance with whomever I could.\nRelated: Everything we know about PS5\nVerdict\nThe Last of Us 2 is a masterful swansong for the PlayStation 4, and arguably the finest, most accomplished project Naughty Dog has ever embarked on. It’s far more than a traditional sequel, taking the original’s core message and expanding upon in ways that will be looked back on as brave, ambitious and undeniably controversial.\nBut the impression it leaves behind is palpable, and one I hope future blockbusters will aspire to replicate. Its approach to diversity, mechanical execution and unwillingness to hold the player’s hand even in its darkest moments build to a closing chapter that will leave you in stunned silence.",

Set five years after The Last of Us (2013), the game focuses on two playable characters in a post-apocalyptic United States whose lives intertwine: Ellie, who sets out in revenge for a murder, and Abby, a soldier who becomes involved in a conflict between her militia and a religious cult. The game uses a third-person perspective; the player must fight human enemies and cannibalistic zombie-like creatures with firearms, improvised weapons, and stealth.\nDevelopment of The Last of Us Part II began in 2014, soon after the release of The Last of Us Remastered. Neil Druckmann returned as creative director, co-writing the story with Halley Gross. The themes of revenge and retribution were inspired by Druckmann's experiences growing up in Israel. Ashley Johnson reprises her role as Ellie, while Laura Bailey was cast as Abby. Their performances included the simultaneous recording of motion and voice. The developers pushed the technical capabilities of the PlayStation 4 during development. Gustavo Santaolalla returned to compose and perform the game's score. Development reportedly included a crunch schedule of 12-hour workdays.\nFollowing some delays, partly due to the COVID-19 pandemic, The Last of Us Part II was released on June 19, 2020. It received critical acclaim, with praise for its gameplay, audio design, score, performances, characters, and visual fidelity, though its narrative and themes divided critics. It was the subject of review bombing on Metacritic, with some players criticizing the story and characters; discourse surrounding the game became adversarial. Part II is one of the best-selling PlayStation 4 games and the fastest-selling PlayStation 4 exclusive, with over four million units sold in its release weekend, and over ten million by 2022. It won more than 320 Game of the Year awards and received multiple other accolades from awards shows and gaming publications.\nGameplay[edit]\nThe Last of Us Part II is an action-adventure game played from a third-person perspective featuring elements of the survival horror genre.[1][2] The player traverses post-apocalyptic environments such as buildings and forests to advance the story. The player can use firearms, improvised weapons, and stealth to defend against hostile humans and cannibalistic creatures infected by a mutated strain of the Cordyceps fungus.[3] Control intermittently switches between Ellie and Abby;[1] the player also briefly controls Joel in the opening sequence.[4] The nimble nature of the player character introduces platforming elements, allowing the player to jump and climb to traverse environments and gain advantages during combat.[5] The player can break glass objects such as windows to access certain areas or obtain supplies.[6] Some areas are navigated by horse or boat.[3][7]\nIn combat, the player can use long-range weapons such as rifles and bows,[3][8] and short-range weapons such as pistols and revolvers.[5] The player is able to scavenge limited-use melee weapons such as machetes and hammers,[9] and throw bricks and bottles to distract or attack enemies.[10] Collected items can be used to upgrade weapons at workbenches[11] or craft equipment such as health kits, Molotov cocktails, and makeshift silencers.[1] The player can collect supplements to upgrade skills in a skill tree; training manuals found throughout the environment unlock additional skill tree branches, allowing upgrades to attributes such as the health meter, crafting speed, and ammunition types.[12]\nThough the player can attack enemies directly, they can also use stealth to attack undetected or sneak past them.[1] \"Listen Mode\" allows the player to locate enemies through a heightened sense of hearing and spatial awareness, indicated as outlines visible through walls and objects.[10] In the cover system, the player can crouch behind obstacles to gain advantages in combat, and can also crawl in a prone position to evade enemies.[13] Hostile enemies use artificial intelligence; they may take cover or call for assistance, and can take advantage when the player is distracted, out of ammunition, or in a fight.[14] The player may be impaled by an arrow, which will progressively decrease their health meter and disables Listen Mode until removed when in cover.[15] Player companions, such as Dina, assist in combat by killing enemies or announcing their location.[16] The game also introduces guard dogs that track the player's scent, which can be visualized in Listen Mode.[1]\nPlot[edit]\nJoel Miller (Troy Baker) confesses to his brother Tommy (Jeffrey Pierce) his responsibility in preventing the Fireflies attempting to find a cure for the Cordyceps fungus pandemic by saving Ellie (Ashley Johnson) from an operation that would have killed her. Four years later, Joel and Ellie have built a life in Jackson, Wyoming, though their relationship has become strained. While on patrol, Joel and Tommy rescue a stranger, Abby Anderson (Laura Bailey), from an Infected horde. They return to an outpost being used as a temporary hideout by Abby's group, former Fireflies now part of the Washington Liberation Front (WLF), a militia group based in Seattle, Washington. The group attack Joel and Tommy; Abby seeks revenge against Joel for killing her father, the Firefly surgeon (Derek Phillips) who was to perform the operation on Ellie. Meanwhile, Ellie and her girlfriend Dina (Shannon Woodward) leave Jackson in search of the brothers. Ellie enters the WLF outpost and witnesses Abby beat Joel to death. She swears revenge.\nTommy sets out for Seattle to hunt Abby, and Ellie and Dina follow him. After escaping a WLF ambush, Ellie reveals her immunity to Dina, who in turn reveals she is pregnant. The next day, Ellie pursues Tommy alone and encounters Jesse (Stephen Chang), Dina's ex-boyfriend, who followed them to Seattle. While searching for Abby's friend, Nora Harris (Chelsea Tavares), Ellie encounters the Seraphites, a religious cult locked in a battle with the WLF over control of Seattle. Ellie tracks down Nora and tortures her for information on Abby's location, which traumatizes Ellie. The following day, she kills two more members of Abby's group, the pregnant Mel (Ashly Burch) and her boyfriend Owen Moore (Patrick Fugit). A flashback reveals that, two years earlier, Ellie traveled to the Firefly hospital in Salt Lake City and learned the truth. Devastated, she cut ties with Joel. In the present, Ellie's group is ambushed by Abby, who kills Jesse and holds Tommy hostage.\nThree days earlier, Abby learns that Owen, her ex-boyfriend, has gone missing while investigating Seraphite activity. Abby searches for Owen and is captured by the Seraphites. She is rescued by Yara (Victoria Grace) and Lev (Ian Alexander), Seraphite siblings who have been branded apostates after Lev defied Seraphite traditions. Though Yara suffers a broken arm, Abby leaves them to find Owen who, disillusioned with the war, plans to sail to Santa Barbara, California, where the Fireflies may be regrouping. Abby returns to rescue Yara and Lev, and travels across Seattle with Lev to retrieve medical supplies from the WLF hospital so Mel can amputate Yara's arm. After the surgery, Lev runs away to convince his devout mother to leave the Seraphite cult, forcing Abby and Yara to pursue him. They find him in the Seraphite settlement, where Lev has accidentally killed his mother in self-defense. The trio flee as the WLF begins an assault on the Seraphites. Abby betrays the WLF to save Lev, and Yara sacrifices herself to allow Abby and Lev to escape. The pair return to find Owen and Mel dead and a map left by Ellie leading to her hideout. An enraged Abby shoots Tommy, impairing him, and brawls with Ellie and Dina, overpowering them. At Lev's insistence, Abby spares them and tells them to leave Seattle.\nSeveral months later,[17] Ellie and Dina are living on a farm, raising Dina and Jesse's son, though Ellie suffers from post-traumatic stress. When Tommy arrives with information on Abby's whereabouts, Ellie leaves to find her, despite Dina's pleas to stay. Abby and Lev arrive in Santa Barbara searching for the Fireflies, who they discover are regrouping at Catalina Island, California, but are captured, tortured, and left to die by the slave-keeping Rattlers. Ellie arrives at Santa Barbara and rescues the pair. Threatening to kill Lev, Ellie forces Abby to fight her, during which Abby bites off two of Ellie's fingers. Ellie overpowers and nearly drowns her, but has a change of heart after having a flashback of Joel, and ultimately spares her. Abby and Lev sail to the Fireflies. Ellie returns to the farmhouse and finds it empty. She tries to play Joel's guitar with her damaged hand, recalls her last conversation with Joel in which she expressed her willingness to forgive him, and leaves.[18]\nDevelopment[edit]\nEarly story concepts for The Last of Us Part II were conceived during the development of The Last of Us in 2013.[19][20] Naughty Dog began development in 2014, soon after the release of The Last of Us Remastered.[21] By August 2017, with the release of Uncharted: The Lost Legacy, the entire 350-person team at Naughty Dog had shifted to develop Part II.[22][23] Neil Druckmann led development as creative director and writer, reprising his role from The Last of Us and Uncharted 4: A Thief's End (2016).[24][25] Anthony Newman and Kurt Margenau were selected to be co-game directors for Part II,[26] overseeing gameplay elements such as level design and mechanics.[27] For the final months of development, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the team operated via remote work arrangements.[23] In total, approximately 2,169 developers across 14 studios worked on the game.[28]\nDruckmann wrote the story with Halley Gross.[23] The team experimented with different plot structures and considered scrapping the project until they settled on an idea that mirrored the first game;[29] Druckmann said that whereas The Last of Us is about the extreme measures one would take for love, Part II is more about how far one would go to bring justice for those they love.[30] The themes of revenge and retribution were inspired by Druckmann's experiences growing up in Israel, where violence was a frequent topic.[23] He recalled watching footage of the 2000 Ramallah lynching, and how, after hearing the cheering crowds, his mind turned to violent thoughts about bringing the perpetrators to justice.[31][32] He wanted the player to feel a \"thirst for revenge\" before making them realize the reality of their actions.[23] Druckmann said other themes include tribalism, trauma, and the pursuit of justice.[30] Artists at Naughty Dog traveled to Seattle to analyze the architecture, vegetation, materials, topography, lighting, and capture photorealistic textures.[29][33]\nAshley Johnson and Troy Baker reprise their roles as Ellie and Joel, respectively, while Laura Bailey was cast as Abby.[34][35] The actors' performances were recorded at a studio in Playa Vista, Los Angeles using performance capture, recording motion and voice simultaneously.[36] Gross noted that a goal of the writers was to \"create the most multifaceted characters you've seen in games\".[33] She particularly wanted to explore the multifaceted behavior of Ellie, showing her power as well as her insecurities.[37] The change of player character from Ellie to Abby was inspired by the change from Joel to Ellie in the first game, though emphasized in Part II due to its focus on empathy.[38] Druckmann wanted the player to hate Abby early in the game, but later empathize with her.[39]\nThe developers pushed the technical capabilities of the PlayStation 4 when creating Part II, adding more enemies and larger environments than in previous games.[20] Druckmann noted that any drops in detail would ruin the sense of authenticity, which required consistent optimization of the technology.[29] Improved artificial intelligence (AI) allowed for deeper connections with characters and the creation of bonds through gameplay.[40] The Last of Us Part II was originally planned as an open world game with hub worlds, but later game transferred to a more linear style as it better served the narrative.[41] Naughty Dog wanted to increase the accessibility options introduced in Uncharted 4 to ensure that all players could complete the story, and the developers attended conferences and worked with advocates.[42]\nGustavo Santaolalla returned to compose and perform the game's score, as he had done with the first game,[43] while Mac Quayle contributed to combat music.[23] The developers received permission to use the songs \"Future Days\" by Pearl Jam and \"Take On Me\" by A-ha.[44] To achieve the sound of the Shamblers, the team hired voice actors Raul Ceballos and Steve Blum, and used items such as grapefruits to create the explosion sounds. The dialogue team referenced whistled languages such as Sfryria and Silbo Gomero for the Seraphites' whistling, and hired actors Stevie Mack and Lisa Marie to provide the whistles in three styles.[45]\nAccording to a report by Kotaku's Jason Schreier, the development included a crunch schedule of 12-hour work days. This continued after the game was delayed. Schreier suggested that development was slowed due to the enormous turnover of employees following the development of Uncharted 4, with few veterans left on the team. Some of the developers allegedly hoped that Part II would fail and prove that the working conditions were not viable. Publisher Sony Interactive Entertainment granted Naughty Dog an additional two weeks of development for bug fixes.[46] Druckmann felt that he had failed to find the correct balance for employees on Part II, and said the studio would receive external assistance for future projects.[47]\nRelease and promotion[edit]\nThe Last of Us Part II was announced at the PlayStation Experience event on December 3, 2016.[34] At E3 2018, Druckmann said that Naughty Dog was refusing to announce a release date until the game was \"very close to release\", to avoid disappointing fans.[48] During Sony's State of Play presentation on September 24, 2019, Naughty Dog announced a release date of February 21, 2020.[49] On October 25, Druckmann announced a delay to May 29, 2020, to \"bring the entire game up to a level of polish we would call Naughty Dog quality\".[50] On April 2, 2020, Sony announced that the game was almost complete but had been indefinitely delayed to due to logistical problems caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.[51] In late April, several videos leaked online, showing cutscenes, gameplay, and significant plot details. Druckmann tweeted that he was \"heartbroken\" for fans and for the team, who had devoted years to development.[52] On April 27, Sony announced a release date of June 19, 2020.[53]\nThe first trailer was released alongside the announcement, showcasing the return of Ellie and Joel.[54] The second trailer, released in October 2017 as a part of Paris Games Week, revealed Abby, Yara, and Lev.[55][56] Dina and Jesse were first shown in a presentation at E3 2018.[57] A trailer was featured in Sony's State of Play presentation in September 2019,[58] which preceded additional marketing to celebrate Outbreak Week—the week in which the fictional outbreak occurred in the original game.[59] A story trailer was released on May 6,[60] followed by an animated commercial on June 3,[61] and the final pre-launch trailer on June 10.[62] Naughty Dog replaced and altered characters in the trailers to conceal story events; Druckmann cited the marketing of Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty (2001), which concealed its protagonist in trailers, as an influence.[63]\nNaughty Dog announced the special edition versions in September 2019.[64] The game was featured in its own standalone State of Play presentation on May 27.[65] From May 13 to June 3, Naughty Dog released a series of videos about the development.[66] The game was banned in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, attributed to the countries' conservative traditions regarding homosexuality.[67] An update on August 13 added a permadeath mode, a new difficulty level, and gameplay modifiers.[68] For The Last of Us Day[a] in September 2020, Naughty Dog announced new merchandise for the game, including a vinyl soundtrack, board game, statues, and posters.[70] A performance update was released on May 19, 2021, allowing gameplay at 60 frames per second on the PlayStation 5.[71]\nReception[edit]\nCritical

Us Part II received \"universal acclaim\" from critics, according to review aggregator Metacritic.[72] It was praised for its improved gameplay,[1][2][75] graphical fidelity,[2][5][74] cast performances,[73][76][77] characters,[1][5][7] audio design,[5][76][78] and music,[74][79][80] though critics were divided on its narrative and themes.[7][8][74][78] Jonathon Dornbush of IGN called it \"a masterpiece worthy of its predecessor\" and wrote that \"it delivers a layered, emotionally shattering story on top of stealth and action gameplay that improves the first game's mechanics [... and] still makes time for a stunning, nuanced exploration of the strength and fragility of the human spirit\".[5] Game Informer's Andy McNamara concurred, calling it \"the best narrative game I have played\" and \"a sequel unlike any other, taking video game storytelling to new heights.\"[74] Kaity Kline of NPR wrote that it \"made me very aware of the little things in my life that I take for granted, the kinds of things you don't appreciate until they're ripped away forever\".[81] GameSpot's Kallie Plagge called it \"beautiful and devastating\", and wrote that \"the more I reflect on it, the more I appreciate the story and characters at its core\".[1]\nGame Informer's McNamara felt that the writers conveyed the themes \"with careful nuance and unflinching emotion\".[74] Destructoid's Chris Carter and VG247's Kirk McKeand applauded the use of minor dialogue to echo the themes.[7][73] Sammy Barker of Push Square particularly praised the use of flashback and overlapping stories;[76] The Guardian's Keza MacDonald concurred, describing the narrative as \"emotionally effective\".[77] Conversely, GameRevolution's Michael Leri thought that the flashbacks were evidence of pacing problems.[75] Alex Avard of GamesRadar+ felt that the narrative lost its momentum during its need to finalize every story thread.[2] USgamer's Kat Bailey found the latter half slow, and that the game was five hours \"too long\".[8] Bailey also criticized the dissonance between the statement against violence and its necessity during gameplay.[8] Polygon's Maddy Myers and Kotaku's Riley MacLeod wrote that the game repeatedly delivered its themes without allowing the player any agency in their decisions.[3][13] Rob Zacny of Vice wrote that, despite the amount of narrative moments, \"it doesn't have much to say\".[78] Also writing for Vice, Emanuel Maiberg wrote that the attempts to parallel the Israeli–Palestinian conflict through the WLF and Seraphites were poor, particularly in its allegorical representation of two equal sides.[82]\nMcKeand of VG247 described every character as \"complex and human\".[7] Destructoid's Carter felt empathetic to the main characters,[73] a sentiment echoed by IGN's Dornbush, who found Ellie's development particularly \"riveting\".[5] Andrew Webster of The Verge praised the relationship between Ellie and Dina, though noted some dissonance in Ellie's behavior between gameplay and cutscenes.[83] GameSpot's Plagge wrote that Abby's characterization led to a deeper connection to her than to Ellie, but found her character development incongruous with her \"onslaught of combat against human enemies\".[1] Kotaku's MacLeod and VentureBeat's Dean Takahashi appreciated the diversity of characters;[13][84] Oli Welsh of Eurogamer praised the representation of female and LGBT characters, calling it \"a game about women\".[80] NPR's Kline lauded the game's ability to \"connect with every character, not just the main characters\".[81] Push Square's Barker wrote that the supporting characters \"establish themselves extremely swiftly\",[76] and Game Informer's McNamara found their occasional absence alarming, having grown close to them.[74] Conversely, some critics felt that the new supporting characters lacked the higher quality of the main characters and of Naughty Dog's previous work;[8][75] Yannick Le Fur of Jeuxvideo.com wrote that characters such as Jesse and Manny were simply used to advance the narrative.[85] Polygon's Myers and Vice's Zacny criticized the characters' inability to learn from their mistakes.[3][78]\nCritics praised the cast's performances, particularly that of Ashley Johnson, Troy Baker, and Laura Bailey.[7][73][76][77] Welsh of Eurogamer found Johnson's performance as Ellie to be \"standout\" due to her depiction of \"rawness, vulnerability, and rage\".[80] GamesRadar+'s Avard considered Johnson's portrayal of suffering \"nothing short of awards worthy\", and found that Baker \"steals some of Part 2's best scenes as Joel\" by adding complexities that enrich the character and relationships.[2] Dornbush of IGN wrote that Johnson added nuance to every element of Ellie, and commended Woodward's performance as Dina, especially during quieter moments.[5] VG247's McKeand found that the performances made the narrative more powerful.[7]\nAvard of GamesRadar+ felt that the new gameplay mechanics were added with a level of care to ensure an authenticity that Naughty Dog is known for.[2] GameRevolution's Leri lauded the cohesiveness between gameplay and narrative, and the former's ability to create empathy.[75] Plagge of GameSpot appreciated the intensity of combat and wrote that \"Ellie's movements are smooth enough that they almost look scripted\".[1] VentureBeat's Takahashi found the combat more diverse than its predecessor's.[14] IGN's Dornbush similarly felt that the combat gameplay and puzzle elements had been improved, praising the intelligence and variation of enemies.[5] Avard of GamesRadar+ described the enemy AI as \"some of the most advanced\" of any game.[2] McKeand of VG247 considered the level design better than other Naughty Dog games,[7] and McNamara of Game Informer felt that it improved combat scenarios.[74] The Verge's Webster admired the action but noted some \"awkward moments when [it] attempts to cover its video game-ness\".[83] Polygon's Myers found the combat an unsubtle messenger for its statement on violence;[3] Kotaku's MacLeod wrote that the \"pace of the combat sometimes felt like punishment\".[13]\nMany critics felt the graphics were among the best of any PlayStation 4 game.[2][5][74][75] Kotaku's MacLeod wrote that the nature in Seattle is \"gorgeous and awe-inspiring\",[13] and Push Square's Barker declared the art department \"among the best in the industry\".[76] The Guardian's MacDonald described the graphics as \"meticulous and astounding\".[77] Dornbush of IGN appreciated the world's ability to tell additional stories.[5] GameRevolution's Leri considered the environments more realistic than the first game's, and praised the technical elements, such as frame rate, lack of load times, and realistic lighting.[75] Carter of Destructoid felt that the seamless animation of minor facial expressions humanized the characters to a new level.[73] McNamara of Game Informer similarly lauded the realistic-looking characters.[74] VentureBeat's Takahashi commended the improvements to Naughty Dog's already impressive engine.[14] Zacny of Vice found Seattle too similar to Boston and Pittsburgh from the first game,[78] and Christopher Byrd of The Washington Post wondered if the detail was worth the \"human cost\" of Naughty Dog's crunch culture.[86]\nBarker of Push Square described the sound design as \"stunning\", identifying the 3D audio as a technical feat he would not have expected until PlayStation 5.[76] Vice's Zacny found that the audio design made settings feel more lifelike in a way that the visuals occasionally failed to do.[78] IGN's Dornbush similarly felt that the sounds added realism, and praised Santaolalla's \"moving\" score.[5] McNamara of Game Informer found that the music added tension.[74] Kevin Dunsmore of Hardcore Gamer wrote that the \"haunting and subtle melodies blend into the world seamlessly\".[79] Eurogamer's Welsh praised the score for its combination of banjo and electronics.[80]\nAudience response[edit]\nThe game was the subject of review bombing on Metacritic, resulting in a user review score of 3.4/10 at its nadir.[87][88] Reporters noticed the review bombing occurred shortly after the game launched, too early for users to feasibly have finished it;[89] some suggested that the reviews were based on the incomplete plot leaks.[85][88] Many of the negative reviews criticized the characterization and plot;[87][89] some complained of \"social justice warrior\" politics, with vitriolic responses to LGBT characters.[85][87] CNET's Daniel Van Boom wrote that the review bombers did not represent the majority of players,[90] while Kotaku's MacLeod identified thousands of positive user reviews; the latter wrote that Metacritic's opaque system, which emphasizes scores over critique, comprised only \"a bunch of meaningless numbers and a lot of rage\".[89]\nSome players criticized Joel's death in the opening hours, perceiving a discrepancy between his cautious nature in the first game and his more trustful and protective attitude in Part II.[91][92] Den of Geek's Matthew Byrd wrote that Joel had protected young women in the past, so his trusting of Abby in Part II was not \"entirely unreasonable\".[91] Sam Clench of News.com.au also argued that Joel's time in Jackson had realistically made him less cynical over the years.[92] A number of players considered Joel's brutal and undignified death \"disrespectful\";[92][93][94] Clench rebutted that it was realistic, as most real deaths occur at unfortunate times, and described the scene as \"extremely strong, purposeful writing\".[92] Josh Hawkins of Shacknews wrote that Joel's death was a fitting retribution for his brutal actions and murders.[94] Some players felt the marketing, which had altered and replaced characters in trailers to conceal Joel's death and Abby's role, was intentionally deceptive;[90][91][93] Druckmann responded that Naughty Dog had intended to preserve the game experience, \"not to bamboozle anyone or get their $60\".[63]\nA subset of players criticized Abby and disapproved of her playable chapters as they had expected to control Ellie for the majority of the game.[91][95][96] Collider's Dave Trumbore felt Abby had been unfairly maligned by audiences who had failed to understand the story's message.[97] Some players criticized Abby's muscular physique, and theories spread online that she was transgender; The Independent's Amy Coles and Polygon's Patricia Hernandez argued that this perception was a result of the lack of body diversity in games, and that the story showed Abby had the resources to achieve her physique.[96][98] Coles observed that these arguments were propagated by \"a loud and determinedly misogynistic subset\" of players.[96] Laura Bailey, who played Abby, became the target of online death threats in response to the character;[99] Naughty Dog released a statement condemning the threats, and Bailey was supported by James Gunn, Ashley Johnson, and Craig Mazin, among others.[100]\nSome members of the transgender community objected to the representation of Lev, a transgender supporting character. Criticism focused on villains using Lev's deadname, that the character was created by cisgender writers, and the use of trans stories as tragedies.[101][102] Stacey Henley of VG247 responded that Lev's deadname is used sparingly and that Ian Alexander, a transgender actor, provides the character's voice and motion capture.[101] Writing for Paste, Waverly praised the choice to have Lev played by a transgender actor, but felt there was too much emphasis on his gender identity and the suffering he experienced for it. Waverly felt that \"Lev's story isn't made for trans people, but to give cisgender players a space to connect with their guilt and pity for trans people\".[103] Henley wrote that, while Lev's story is imperfect, it is \"a major step for trans characters in gaming, [and] focuses on a highly charismatic and central character who is far more than this transness\".[101] Kotaku's MacLeod saw Lev's character as simply a way of acknowledging that trans people exist in the game's universe and wrote that it was up to the player to create their own meaning from the character.[104] Alexander acknowledged the writers \"might have missed the mark a little bit\" regarding the use of Lev's deadname but felt Abby's response[c] reflected the importance of allowing trans individuals the agency to discuss their gender on their own terms.[105]\nA year after the game's release, Collider's Trumbore identified a subset of players continued to criticize the game and its legacy, comparing it to some audience complaints about Star Wars: The Last Jedi (2017), though recognized it was \"quieter\" than at launch.[106] In July 2021, a user of a subreddit focused on denouncing Part II claimed they received death threats from fans of YouTube channel Girlfriend Reviews, who had posted positive videos about the game; following target harassment from the subreddit, Girlfriend Reviews discovered the threats were fabricated by the user.[107][108]\nDeveloper response[edit]\nPolygon's Hernandez observed that the discourse surrounding The Last of Us Part II had become adversarial, with \"bigots\" attacking the game for its diverse cast and Naughty Dog becoming defensive.[109] Vice's Zacny claimed that, in response to his critical review, Sony contacted him on behalf of Naughty Dog to discuss his criticisms, which they disagreed with; Zacny said the discussion, while cordial, was unusual from a large publisher. On Twitter, Druckmann expressed disapproval for journalist Jason Schreier after he mocked a comparison of Part II to the 1993 film Schindler's List. Baker responded to another comment from Schreier, that \"video games are too long\", with a quote from US president Theodore Roosevelt about critics being less valuable than creators.[109] Hernandez concluded that this was \"not an environment that is conducive to encouraging honest reviews or critical discussion, which is ultimately a disservice to the game itself\".[109] Bailey of USgamer wrote that the strict review embargo prevented meaningful discussion of the narrative.[110] Druckmann acknowledged that the embargo had been enforced as a result of the plot leaks, as he had felt that reviews discussing plot details would have become more harmful and widespread than the leaks themselves.[63]\nAccolades[edit]\nThe Last of Us Part II won more than 320 Game of the Year awards,[111] which several outlets claimed broke the record set by The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt (2015);[112][113][114] it was later surpassed by Elden Ring (2022).[111][115] The game was awarded from outlets and shows such as Den of Geek,[116] Digital Trends,[117] Electronic Gaming Monthly,[118] Empire,[119] Entertainment Weekly,[120] Game Informer,[121] PlayStation Blog,[122] Push Square,[123] and the Titanium Awards.[124] It was named runner-up by several other publications.[125][126][127][128] The Last of Us Part II was ranked among the best games of its generation by Game Informer,[129] GamesRadar,[130] and IGN.[131] At the 38th Golden Joystick Awards in November 2020, it won all six awards for which it was nominated: Ultimate Game of the Year, Best Audio, Best Storytelling, Best Visual Design, PlayStation Game of the Year, and Studio of the Year for Naughty Dog.[132] It led the nominees for The Game Awards 2020 with 11 nominations,[133] of which it won seven, the most in the show's history: Game of the Year, Best Game Direction, Best Narrative, Best Audio Design, Innovation in Accessibility, Best Action/Adventure, and Best Performance (for Bailey).[134]\nThe Last of Us Part II was nominated for 24 awards at the National Academy of Video Game Trade Reviewers Awards, the most in the show's history;[135] it won eight, including Outstanding Direction in a Game Cinema, Franchise Adventure Game, Lead Performance in a Drama (for Johnson and Bailey), and Supporting Performance in a Drama (for Baker).[136] It was nominated for 13 awards at the 17th British Academy Games Awards, the most in the show's history,[137] winning for Animation, the publicly-voted EE Game of the Year, and Performer in a Leading Role (for Bailey).[138] It led the nominees at the 24th Annual D.I.C.E.

The game plays great, nothing spectacular, just solid. Combat is meaty and sufficiently brutal and really doesn't shy away from gore and graphic injuries. You wont be blown away by how it plays but this isn't a game about beautiful controls and insane combat. Voice acting, character models, facial expressions, dialogue and music is all really top notch, probably the best i've seen in fact. This game really does drag you into it's world and holds your attention like few other games that i have ever played have managed to do.\nNow, onto that story... This story will not be for everyone (i'll try not to spoil anything.) The Last of Us 1 & 2 portray a brutal world where the dark side of humanity is laid bare. This is a post apocalyptic world filled with death and misery. It is also filled with beauty and hope. Naughty Dog constantly seeks to play these themes off against one other. Horrible things happen to characters that you like. Characters that you like are often shown to do morally dubious actions which they themselves often wrestle with. TLoU is a world where there are bad guys and there are good guys, but the lines are often blurred as even our heroes have to do terrible things in order to survive. There are consequences to peoples actions in this world, even if they were well intentioned. TLoU 2 takes that one step further by making the player step into the shoes of someone who appears at first to be a blatant bad guy. Even by the end, the actions of said character did not sit well with me, even though i understood their justifications for them. There is no black and white in this game, no right and wrong, just different shades of grey, and a cast of characters wrestling with their morals and emotions in a world that pushes them to both their physical and mental limits. This is not a happy story, there is no ending where our heroes walk off into the sunset to live happily ever after. It is a story of pain, loss, grief, death, anger, revenge, beauty and love. It warns us about the pitfalls of being consumed by rage and an all encompassing desire for revenge. It's a tough story to tell and a delicate line to walk. It is a very adult story that does not shy away from making the player think and question themselves over the actions of the characters. I, personally, think Naughty Dog did a fantastic job in telling it. You may disagree, but there is so much done right in this game that i would say that is worth buying and playing just to see for yourself.\nI love this game. I think Naughty Dog were always going to struggle to produce a sequel to such a successful and beloved game that had such a divisive (yet brilliant) ending, and still manage to keep everyone happy. I feel like some people were always going to be left feeling disappointed by the story no matter what they came up with. If you're one of those people, that's ok, and you're perfectly entitled to that opinion, but you know deep down that this is never a 0/10 game, not in a million years. Even if you dislike the direction they took this game it's still a 6/10 at worst. Worth a play through at least once just so you can spend some more time in this incredible world that Naughty Dog have created. For me, however, this is easily a 9.5/10. The first one still edges it for me, but in all honesty that's most likely just a bit of nostalgia talking. This really is one of the best games made for this generation of consoles, and may even be the best. You'll have to decide that for yourself though.",

            "text": "The Last of Us: Part 2 is finally here after seven years (and a few extra weeks) of waiting. Joel and Ellie's harrowing adventure on the PlayStation 3 had one of the most talked-about endings in gaming history and many thought the story would stop there.\nLast of Us 2 delves deeper into the dramatic climax of the first game, the way Joel's decision impacted him and his relationship with Ellie. The sequel's emotional resonance relies heavily on you having played the first game, and even if you have, it's probably worth refreshing yourself.\nBuy The Last of Us: Part 2 on PS4\nThe Last of Us 2 PS4 review\nThis time, we pick up with Joel and Ellie a few years after the events of the first game. Ellie is a sleeve-tattooed adult and they're both comfortably settled in Jackson County alongside Joel's brother Tommy, his wife Maria and a massive town of people. Life is pretty good with parties, regular supply runs and sensible missions to clear nearby infected.\nEllie learns the guitar thanks to Joel, which you can play yourself during several moments by strumming the touchpad. Hopefully there'll be videos of more musical players picking out whole songs with this mechanic soon.\nInevitably, things soon go bad after the opening hours of the game. If you're lucky enough to have avoided the recent leaks, there are some really effective surprises. We won't spoil them now, but even if you've been spoiled, there's still so much great stuff to experience.\nOverall, The Last of Us: Part 2 is a game about revenge and forgiveness, themes which permeate through the story arc of numerous characters. The enemies mourn the death of their comrades and dogs when you kill them, while warring gangs constantly look for reprisals. However, the real impact of death is best exemplified in the main story.\nThis time, we meet Dina, Ellie's love interest who you'll remember her kissing in the E3 trailer, plus Jesse, Dina's ex-boyfriend who also lives in Jackson. But there's also significant stretches of the game where Ellie is alone.\nSome of the greatest moments from the first game were the witty back-and-forth between Ellie and Joel, from that cheesy joke book to interesting perspectives on being a teenager in a post-apocalyptic world – like why would you not eat food if you have it!?\nBuy The Last of Us: Part 2 on PS4\nSadly, Ellie has grown quite gruff and serious, much like Joel, and her conversations with other characters don't punctuate the horror with quirky levity as the original did. You'll spend long stretches in silence, which can make the constant hunting for essential crafting items seem hollow and repetitive.\nThankfully, the overall story is strong, if convoluted slightly by the various time jumps, but they do help deliver the biggest narrative payoffs. The finale isn't as powerful as the original, but this game definitely feels like a worthy companion to the first game and not a cash-grabbing sequel. This story feels like it completes the picture.\nThe Last of Us 2 PS4 review – gameplay\nGameplay hasn't been overhauled massively from the first time around, but it has been honed across traversal, combat, crafting and upgrading skills.\nEllie is very quick, she can sprint, climb walls and ropes, jump, swim (huzzah), and even lay prone or crawl while taking potshots at enemies, very similarly to Metal Gear Solid.\nThe new dodging function also allows Ellie to swerve melee attacks from man and monster alike, although we didn't find ourselves needing to use it much, as it's often easier to kill enemies with a calculated headshot.\nEllie's starting arsenal is very similar to Joel's; her hunting rifle returns, along with a pistol, revolver, a short pump-action shotgun and the biggest new addition, her hunting bow – a seemingly new essential weapon in modern gaming.\nThere's some meatier weapons down the line, including a crossbow, flamethrower and silenced machine gun, but as with the first game, you get them so late – luckily, there's a New Game+ mode, where you can carry over all your upgrades.\nThere are a few ways to approach combat in the game. If you're stealthy, you'll want to dispatch enemies with arrows, your pistol (if you craft a degradable silencer) or take down enemies by hand with your unbreakable knife – yep, not more crafting shivs for Ellie this time around.\nThe bow is ideal for silently dispatching enemies, but crafting enough arrows can be tricky. You'll likely ditch the stealth once you unlock Ellie's devastating Rambo-style explosive arrows, and we wouldn't blame you.\nYou can also take down enemies from range with the hunting rifle or Molotov cocktails, lay craftable explosive proximity traps or simply run and gun. We often found ourselves beginning encounters stealthily, until we inevitably fumbled and had to start shooting.\nThe game adds a few new enemies including Stalkers, sneaky and quick enemies which are hard to spot using Ellie's listen mode. Plus Shamblers, which push out big acid clouds. The human enemies are split between the WLF (Washington Liberation Front) military-style gang, who occasionally use dogs to track you down, and Scars (Seraphites), a back-to-basics cult who use more axes and bows.\nOutside of combat, the bulk of your time will be spent working your way through areas, occasionally by horse or boat, or searching for items. Upgrading is the same as the first game, with scrap used to improve guns with attachments and all-purpose pills used to improve your many abilities.\nYou'll need to find various combat manuals before unlocking the relevant skill trees, but we found more than enough pills to max out the skills we liked by searching areas thoroughly.\nThe skills improve things like crafting speed, melee strength and the amount of items you can create. You can also improve the explosive range of weapons and your aiming stability. Thankfully, each of these little improvements are pretty noticeable in gameplay, so nothing feels like too much of a waste.\nThe Last of Us 2 PS4 review – the end of the world never looked so good\nWe reviewed the game on a standard PlayStation 4 console, so some of the graphical fidelity might be stronger on a PS4 Pro. Nevertheless, the game looks stunning and is certainly a huge leap compared to the PS3 original and the remastered version.\nSnow leaves realistic footprints, water runs like in real life and looks convincingly murky when you're forced to dive into it, which is handy, as you spend most of your time soaked in the game's main setting of Seattle.\nThe world's buildings, roads, shops and rivers have crumbled in so many ways, while nature has taken hold in a much more visible way. The game really doesn't feel like you're moving through blocky levels that have been designed, so the variety across the locations of Seattle, Washington, Jackson and Wyoming is really impressive.\nHowever, our two biggest takeaways graphically from The Last of Us 2 were the facial animations and gore. The former sees playable characters and NPCs reacting to conversations, weather, heights and combat in real time, which is damn impressive. The tone of the conversations Ellie has are reflected on her face, as is the impending doom of those that she kills.\nSimilarly, the gore in this game is horrifically realistic, enemies lose limbs, heads and get separated from their bodies entirely after explosions and using the shotgun, their blood, brains and sinew paint the areas they die in. Given its realistic setting, this could definitely be the goriest game we've ever played – and we count the likes of Manhunt, Doom: Eternal and God of War.\nThe Last of US 2 – Verdict\nThe Last of Us: Part 2 definitely feels like a passionate, all-consuming companion to the first game. Plus, there's progressive LGBTQ+ representation through Ellie's relationship with Dina, as well as a trans character later in the story, which is too rare in video games.\nThe campaign is a massive journey, which took just over 30 hours to complete on the standard difficulty. Sadly, the first game's online mode Factions doesn't return, but the developer has explained it might return to the format at some stage so fans can experience \"the fruits of our team's online ambition\".\nOverall, The Last of Us 2 is going to be divisive. Naughty Dog has made brave narrative choices for its difficult second album, which we massively respect. We would just have liked to have seen the same applied to the gameplay. It's still solid and thrilling, and if you loved the first game, this is a must-play.\nIt's not as groundbreaking, but equally as heartbreaking.\nThe Last of Us: Part 2 release date: June 19, 2020\nAvailable on: PS4\nDeveloper: Naughty Dog\nPublisher: Sony Interactive Entertainment\nBuy The Last of Us: Part 2 on PS4\nDigital Spy reviewed The Last of Us: Part 2 on a standard PlayStation 4 console.\nDigital Spy now has a newsletter – sign up to get it sent straight to your inbox.\nLooking for more TV recommendations and discussion?

            "text": "It's hard to talk about some of the greatest games of this generation without mentioning the absolute masterpiece that is The Last Of Us. The story of Joel and Ellie is masterfully told in every way, and it was clear that such an amazing title demanded a sequel, otherwise the fans would've been sent into an uproar.\nThis sequel was finally delivered by Naughty Dog this year in the form of The Last Of Us Part 2, which was released to a rather mixed reception. Critics and fans have wildly different opinions on this sequel, but there's no denying the fact that The Last Of Us Part 2 is a technical masterpiece that has shown just what the modern age of gaming is capable of doing.\nUpdated on July 31, 2022, by Ritwik Mitra: The Last of Us series features a duology of two games that took over the gaming world by storm when they were released. While the reception to The Last of Us Part 2 has been pretty divided, the first game was hailed as a masterpiece that players absolutely loved. Both titles are great in their own right, but there are certain aspects where one game overshadows the other. Keeping this in mind, here's an in-depth comparison of both games and where each title excels.\n20 The Last Of Us Part 2: Great Attention To Detail\nThe Last of Us Part 2 shows just how far motion capture technology and graphical fidelity have come in modern times. The game looks absolutely gorgeous, with the amazing facial expressions of the characters making everything seem all the more real.\nIt also helps that the attention to detail for every environment is also incredible. Full-blown stories are present in the background of every area, and it's the player's choice whether they wish to check out these finer details for themselves or not.\n19 The Last Of Us: The Evolution Of Joel And Ellie's Relationship\nJoel and Ellie are two of the most likable video game characters of all time. A big part of why they have such an allure of their own is the amazing character development of them both and how it ties into their dynamic.\nJoel is a jaded individual who finds it scary to get close to Ellie after what happened to his daughter. Meanwhile, Ellie is just looking for someone to rely on after the fate of the world was put on her shoulders. The way these two people get over their own personal demons and form an everlasting bond makes for a great time indeed.\n18 The Last Of Us Part 2: Brilliantly Conveys The Brutality Of Combat\nCombat has always been a strength of both games in the series. However, The Last of Us Part 2 stepped it up quite a bit when it came to conveying the brutality of fighting other humans.\nEach enemy has their name, and other foes react emotionally to the death of their comrades. All of this combines to make combat way more intense, brutal, and conflicting than ever before, which is perfect for the themes that The Last of Us Part 2 wishes to convey.\n17 The Last Of Us: Excellent DLC\nThe Last of Us was a brilliant game in its own right, but Naughty Dog didn't just stop there. They also released the Left Behind DLC for the game, which did a great job elaborating on what Ellie did when Joel was wounded, while also exploring her backstory.\nThe DLC is quite heartwarming and cements why Ellie is such a beloved character. Left Behind is a piece of the story that is almost critical to enjoying the overall experience of playing The Last of Us.\n16 The Last Of Us Part 2: Stealth Gameplay Is Highly Immersive\nIt's only a given that technical advancements would lead to a game's sequel being better than its predecessor in terms of pure gameplay. However, the strides that The Last of Us Part 2 has taken should definitely be commended.\nStealth gameplay is a huge part of The Last of Us, and the sequel expands upon this even more. Players can go completely prone and slowly whittle down enemy groups as each member gets increasingly horrified by the shadows that haunt them.\n15 The Last Of Us: Horror Elements\nThe second game focused too much on the theme of hate to make the zombies much of a threat. This meant the horror aspects were toned down in favor of the brutality of human nature. The first game was better in this regard as the zombies were made to be a force.\nIt also had the benefit of introducing these monsters, meaning players weren’t prepared to face them based on previous experience. The game also laid out environments where facing the hardest kinds of zombies could mean instant death, making these moments filled with tension.\n14 The Last Of Us Part 2: Realistic Graphics\nThe passage of time obviously contributed to The Last of Us Part 2 being higher in terms of quality here, but the realism certainly was a thing of its own. The first game didn’t stand out among other games of its generation, which wasn’t the case with the sequel.\nThe Last of Us Part 2 is remarkable in making things out to be realistic, as character models not only look lifelike but also interact with one another this way. This is what enabled the gritty environment to come across that way.\n13 The Last Of Us: Soundtrack\nThere’s a terrible beauty in exploring the world in the first The Last of Us, as the music that accompanies these moments truly sets the stage for heartstrings to be pulled. The second game had flashes of brilliance in this area but not the seamless nature of the first.\nThe original game didn’t take the soundtrack to high-octane levels, instead focusing on the dystopian world and how being in such a place would sound. Of course, the melancholic sequences have the right track playing in the background to capture the right emotional gut punch.\n12 The Last Of Us Part 2: Better Villain\nThere was no one villain in The Last of Us, with several characters appearing infrequently to antagonize the characters. However, the second game had the theme of hate down so well that the lines between who the villain is supposed to become blurred.\nBoth Ellie and Abby can be considered the antagonist if viewed from each other’s point of view. This makes the villain aspect twofold for the game since there’s no real hero and only the choice of the player over who they want to favor.\n11 The Last Of Us: Originality\nThe concept of the series was presented in the first game, and the second only built upon this. Things like the characters working together, the sequences where players have to navigate them during emotional moments, and the overall setting were introduced here.\nThe Last of Us Part 2 wouldn’t have felt as special had it been a different game, so it has the first game to thank for carrying forward this goodwill. Original aspects in gaming are what made The Last of Us stand out, and it remains this way even after the second title’s release.\n10 The Last Of Us: Perhaps The Greatest Intro In Gaming\nNaughty Dog has a reputation for creating games that have come to define the console they're on, with Crash Bandicoot being a pretty notable exception. Similarly, when it comes to the PlayStation 3, one of the first games that people think about that has made this console iconic is undoubtedly The Last Of Us. However, to achieve this landmark again, Naughty Dog had to start the game off on a strong note, and they did so in spectacular fashion.\nSarah might've only had a few minutes of screen time, but that was enough to show the loving bond between her and Joel. This made her tragic, unforeseen death all the more emotional for the player and Joel alike.\n9 The Last Of Us Part 2: Pushed Modern Hardware To Its Very Limits\nAs was the case with the first game, The Last Of Us Part 2 was also released at the tail end of the PS4's lifespan. This was a calculated decision on Naughty Dog's part since it allowed them to refine the visuals to a T.\nThe sheer level of graphical and technical fidelity present in the game makes it abundantly clear that The Last Of Us Part 2 has truly made the most of the PS4's hardware to boost its aesthetics.\n8 The Last Of Us: Introduced Unique Gameplay That Still Feels Like A Naughty Dog Game\nOne of the biggest struggles surrounding The Last Of Us was figuring out a way to revamp the gameplay that would fall in their comfort zone, yet feel nothing like the energetic battles in the Uncharted series.\nThe result was a slower, yet more engaging combat system that rewarded players who took their time and analyzed the situation instead of bursting into the scene and wasting all of their firepower.\n7 The Last Of Us Part 2: Refined The Gameplay\nThe Last Of Us Part 2 knew better than to fiddle around with the original game's mechanics or add some other convoluted mechanics of their own which wouldn't fit with the overall structure of the game.\nThe end result was a gameplay system that felt familiar, yet had been refined to such an extent that each encounter and gameplay moment just felt more satisfying. Of course, it certainly helped that the environments around which players could roam had been opened up to a substantial extent.\n6 The Last Of Us: Its Protagonist\nThe Last Of Us may have its critics, but there's one point that even the game's biggest critics have to acknowledge: Joel is an incredibly well-written protagonist who is a ton of fun to play as.\nEven after his morally dubious actions at the end of the first game, people can't help but love Joel for being so layered and relatable.\n5 The Last Of Us Part 2: The Dynamic Between Ellie And Abby\nWhile the presence of Joel is sorely missed throughout The Last Of Us Part 2, the game's bold risk to have two protagonists certainly pays off.\nControlling both Ellie and Abby is a joy, with the subtle differences in gameplay being just enough to make both characters feel like unique individuals.\n4 The Last Of Us: Storytelling\nIt would be impossible to talk about The Last Of Us without mentioning the elephant in the room: the game's story. At a time when zombies were becoming a tired trope, The Last Of Us served as a breath of fresh air for the genre, mainly due to the amazing tale it weaves.\nUnlike most cliched tales that have become all too commonplace in gaming, The Last Of Us decided to explore humanity as a whole. Suffice to say, the end result pretty much speaks for it.\n3 The Last Of Us Part 2: Bold Risk-Taking\nRegardless of all the controversy that the game might've faced since its release, one thing holds true for The Last Of Us Part 2: it took a huge risk in its narrative, a tendency that is dying out in modern video gaming, where every developer chooses to play it safe to pander to people as opposed to letting their creativity shine.\nIn this environment, the risk that The Last Of Us Part 2 took led to the game being a hot topic of conversation in the gaming community, an instance that is quite rare.\n2 The Last Of Us: The Universal Acclaim\nAt the end of the day, perhaps talking about how great The Last Of Us is is pretty unnecessary.\nAfter all, one need only look at the sheer amount of praise heaped onto this title by critics and fans alike to understand that this game is truly special. This is a game everyone who enjoys gaming should take a shot at playing.\n1 The Last Of Us Part 2: A Glimpse Into Gaming Evolution\nWhile this might've already been mentioned before, attention definitely needs to be drawn towards the sheer technical mastery present in The Last Of Us Part 2.\nThe sheer number of accessibility options present in The Last Of Us Part 2 is just one of the many ways in which this game is shaping the way gaming will evolve over time, while a number of its gameplay mechanics also show how the gaming industry has evolved to the point where technical excellence has augmented these gameplay loops to a whole new level.\nThe Last Of Us Part 2 is available for PlayStation 4.",

            "text": "‘The Last of Us Part II’ is The Most Disappointing Video Game I Have Ever Played: Here’s Why\nThe Last of Us Part II is one of the toughest gaming experiences I’ve ever endured, and writing about that experience is equally difficult. I loved the original Last of Us despite the story far outshining the gameplay, but thought it didn’t need a sequel. The ambiguity of Ellie’s final word, “Okay,” before the credits rolled earned The Last of Us a top spot for best video game endings of all time. Despite my fondness for that nearly perfect ending, I immediately lapped up the announcements and press events and trailers leading up to the release of The Last of Us Part II, for it’s so easy to want more from an intellectual property you care a lot about. Along the way to the release of Part II, I avoided ubiquitous plot leaks but was aware of the controversy and backlash from those who had been exposed to the story details. It was the most anticipation I had felt towards a game since Death Stranding launched, and that’s what made the gut-punch of playing it unbearable.\nI don’t hate The Last of Us Part II for the commonly cited reasons that circulate around the internet. It’s disgusting that Naughty Dog’s members who worked on the game have received hateful and threatening messages in response to this game. Furthermore, the sort of hate that is being leveled at the game itself is primarily homophobic, misogynistic, and transphobic in nature – attitudes beneath contempt. Unfortunately, that disturbing and abusive behavior has been conflated by Naughty Dog – and Neil Druckmann in particular – with respectful criticism of the game itself, notably the writing and pacing issues that I personally found grating. Moments in this game are exceptional, thus the devil deserves to be given its due before exorcising it.\nWhat ‘The Last of Us Part II’ Gets Right\nThe first thing to be said in praise of The Last of Us Part II is the staggering attention to detail throughout the entirety of the game. Naughty Dog is nearly unrivaled in environmental creation – Uncharted: The Lost Legacy being a paragon of this proficiency – and thus it is no surprise that The Last of Us Part II lives and breathes design sophistication. This sophistication most notably carries over into animations, with an unbelievable amount of contextual reactions of the game’s multiple characters such as Dina, Ellie’s partner, scavenging a shop alongside the player instead of just wandering about. Simple gestures like Ellie covering her breath in tense situations similarly sell the protagonist’s character model as well. When scrutinizing the technical components of this sequel, practically any praise that could be aimed at well-executed game design could be found within The Last of Us Part II. It stands at the peak of what the Playstation 4 has been capable of, completely dwarfing its predecessor in every conceivable way – apart from narrative.\nThe gameplay has also been refined in ways that address nearly every critique that I harbor towards the original game. Part II’s gunplay is smoother and tighter. Enemies respond in more tactful ways, flanking you and using dogs to help sniff out your location. The weapon variety has been expanded. You no longer have to manually craft a shiv, since Ellie upgraded to a permanent pocket knife. Even the notorious Naughty Dog crate puzzles have been drastically reduced; when they are present, they actually take a bit of quick thinking as opposed to just pointing an analog stick in a direction. From top to bottom, the mechanics of traversal and combat have been completely polished and upgraded from the original game. This is easily the most fluid gameplay system that Naughty Dog has ever authored.\nI also found the first four to six hours to be precisely what I wanted from a sequel to The Last of Us, narratively speaking. The interactions between Joel and Ellie are at the heart of why I fell in love with the original game, and the sequel’s introduction expands on how that relationship has developed in the wake of Joel’s lie at the end of the original game. In Part II, I became immediately invested in the new characters, the town of Jackson, and the ways in which Ellie had matured. Though I would have preferred no sequel, these first few hours are more than I could have hoped for in a follow-up effort. But here’s where things get complicated when parsing criticism from vitriol in the discussion around The Last of Us Part II.\nWithout being exposed to the leaks about the story, I deeply knew that Joel must die in the sequel. I haven’t felt that sort of narrative certainty since predicting Dumbledore’s death in the Harry Potter series. It just brought appropriate closure in the same way: men who did morally objectionable things in the name of their conception of righteousness eventually facing the consequences. Unlike many people I have seen online, I was not angry at the writers for killing off Joel. In fact, the brutality and bluntness of the scene in which he is murdered is incredibly powerful and well-executed. Troy Baker has repeatedly referred to this scene as one of the most important in his acting career, and rightly so given the gravity of Joel’s gut-wrenching demise. I don’t intend to dismiss the emotional reaction of those who took Joel’s death as a surprise, but that narrative decision is not a criticism that I hold towards this game.\nFurthermore, I think one of the oft-laid criticisms against this game’s pacing is overblown. It is inelegantly handled, to be fair, but some of the flashbacks provided against the game’s parallel narrative are the best scenes in the game. When thinking back on the original Last of Us, the giraffe scene is perhaps the most standout moment from the entire experience (sans its perfect introduction and ending) precisely because it’s a moment of levity and hope amidst the bleak morass of a post-apocalyptic world. Through a certain flashback, The Last of Us Part II takes the emotional energy of that giraffe scene and amplifies it to a degree that I didn’t think were yet possible in video games.\nThe Museum Flashback\nThe scene in question that I cannot praise enough takes place in a flashback to Ellie’s birthday. Joel takes Ellie on a surprise trip to an abandoned museum that has been overgrown in the many years since humans tended to it. Along the way, Joel and Ellie tease each other, play little pranks, and get kindhearted revenge on each other for doing so. Ellie boldly climbs up a giant dinosaur statue as Joel cautions her to be careful; she dives off the top with the energy of a kid – something we seldom see in Ellie throughout either game. Along the way, there is excellent banter between both characters, revealing the true bond underneath the distrust that actively plagues their relationship in Part II.\nThe museum scene reaches its zenith in a moment of marvel, where Joel has knowingly led Ellie to a space exhibit, featuring an empty space capsule amongst other things. Ellie dons an astronaut helmet before they both enter the space probe. But before Ellie can properly express her full appreciation for how meaningful this birthday has been to her, Joel reveals a cassette tape that he has procured. On this tape is a recording of the countdown to launching a rocket into space. As Ellie closes her eyes, listening to this recording within her astronaut helmet, the camera begins to shake as if the rocket’s engines were truly shooting them off the planet. Reflected in her astronaut visor is the light of what would be fire from the rockets before they reached the vast emptiness of space. The tape ends. Joel and Ellie exchange a few words, but it is clear that Joel has bent over backwards to demonstrate how important Ellie is to him. It is equally clear that Ellie recognizes his paternal efforts.\nThe reason the museum scene is my favorite scene in The Last of Us Part II by a landslide is because it focuses on what I loved about the original game: the dynamic relationship between Joel and Ellie. By killing Joel within the first quarter of the game, this relationship becomes entirely relegated to sparse flashbacks in sequences where Ellie is the playable character. Though I have no bones to pick with the writers for killing off Joel, I do think they did so a bit soon given the length of Part II. I knew this game was about Ellie’s story, not Joel’s, but Part II completely pulls the rug underneath that assumption. Instead, this story is equally about Abby, Joel’s murderer who was not present in the first game. And thus half of Part II is spent in a way that felt completely unrelated from the things I fell in love with while playing the original game.\nHow Abby Overstays Her Welcome\nAbby’s presence in the story returns us to the distinction between whiny incels and critics who make substantial points about the game’s writing. Abby has unfortunately been at the center of much of the aforementioned disgusting behavior online, leading to actress Laura Bailey receiving death threats, amongst other heinous things. Gamers upset that Part II featured a deuteragonist that has more muscle than they do have lambasted Naughty Dog for a number of nonsensical things, best explained with ridicule by Jim Sterling in a recent video on the topic. This gross treatment of her character aside, there is an additional layer of criticism to shed off before reaching the heart of my problems with Abby in Part II.\nThe other issue that I do not share with many players who lament Abby’s core presence in The Last of Us Part II is the fact of having to play as Joel’s killer. Many people who were upset by Joel’s early demise in Part II share the belief that playing as Abby – the murderer of a beloved character – made them hate their time with the game itself. I applaud the boldness of putting the player in the shoes of two parallel protagonists, one of which players of the original game have every motivation to despise. I don’t have a fundamental problem with playing someone I actively detest if it serves a profound narrative purpose. Unfortunately, the writers at Naughty Dog took this interesting concept and decided to expand it into half of their game.\nRevenge is Bad, M’kay?\nSo much of The Last of Us Part II can be boiled down to “revenge is bad.” Joel’s actions at the end of the first game created a cycle of revenge that is completely destructive throughout Part II’s narrative. But instead of adhering to subtlety in pursuing that theme against revenge, the game insists on beating the drum that revenge is bad until the credits roll. From the moment the game took control away from Ellie and instead presented me with Abby’s story, I knew what trick the writers were trying to pull. By spending time in the shoes of Joel’s murderer, eventually we would realize that she’s a human being with relationships and motivations all of her own. In reaching the end of the story, in theory, we would feel a deep inner conflict about Ellie’s impetus to take revenge on behalf of Joel. But the problem with The Last of Us Part II is that it takes this idea of empathizing with a perceived antagonist and completely forgets about Ellie for the majority of the remaining gameplay. It also fails to connect the player’s prolonged experience in Abby’s shoes to the eventually reconnected player relationship to Ellie’s.\nI have repeatedly mulled over how Abby’s character could better fit into Part II in a way that wouldn’t cause resentment from me. Initially, I just wanted less Abby. When playing Part II, I kept hoping that the next destination Abby reached would be when I finally regained control of Ellie – the reason I was playing this game in the first place. But repeatedly – and this is a problem with the game as a whole – just when it seems like the end destination is in sight, something goes wrong and you have to work your way around a new route, extending the chapter further. I felt like I had nearly been drowned by the amount of time spent with Abby by the end, so naturally my mind came up with a few ways that this would have sat better with me.\nHow Could Abby’s Character Better Fit Into ‘Part II’?\nI first imagined the game more frequently cutting between Ellie’s and Abby’s perspective, taking the “Seattle: Day 1” pacing and bouncing between characters almost like mirroring episodes. As explored in a roundtable discussion on the Epilogue Gaming Twitch channel, this pacing wouldn’t give the same impact as it eventually attempts to by showing us where the player’s journey with Abby is going. I also imagined us having more time with Abby up front, perhaps a cold open where we play as Abby leading up until the point where she kills Joel, and then control is released for Ellie’s character. While I love the idea of the narrative bait-and-switch, I don’t see how this could have ever been greenlit as an idea. A final idea was to imagine Abby’s character as a sort of spinoff in the vein of Naughty Dog’s Uncharted: The Lost Legacy, devoting a full game in the Last of Us universe to this character that the developers clearly had such a passion for. Maybe Abby should have been the protagonist of The Last of Us Part III, assuming that is in development.\nPlaying as Abby was ultimately annoying, not because she felt out of place in the story, but because she felt out of place in the game. Part of the core gameplay loop in The Last of Us is to scavenge for resources, requiring you to attend to every nook and cranny within each environment. The positive feedback to this gameplay loop consists in upgrading core weapons for your character. For the first dozen or so hours of Part II, I was fully invested in maximizing all of Ellie’s arsenal, going far out of my way to ensure I unlocked safes and investigated abandoned buildings to achieve this. Then the game takes Ellie away and you then are tasked with upgrading an entirely new character from scratch. This was the fundamental problem I had with the game’s decision to break the story apart in the way that they chose to, in that I felt like my previous progression within the game itself had been undermined by the developers. This feeling of my efforts being undermined contributed no doubt to my annoying impatience at the sheer scope of how much time Naughty Dog wanted to devote to this new character.\nEllie’s Abrupt and Unconvincing Change of Heart\nOne of the major problems that the player’s time with Abby presents narratively is the question of Ellie’s eventual decision to free Abby at the end of the game rather than killing her outright. As players, there are plenty of moments with Abby that engender a kind of empathy and sense that she may not deserve death. Barring the maternal behavior Abby displays towards Lev when freed, paralleling the relationship between Joel and Ellie from the first game, Ellie has no explicit reason to revoke her revenge in this final act. Abby has killed Joel, Ellie’s father figure, and has given her post-traumatic stress that rends apart her family with Dina. Ellie has left everything behind to take revenge on Abby, hunting down her entire crew of friends, murdering hundreds of people (whose lives are equally complex as Abby’s, as evidenced by the fact that these enemies are called out by name when killed) just to finally finish Abby off. Sure, Ellie seeing her mortal enemy, the source of her psychological distress, essentially crucified and emaciated up on a beach could make Ellie reconsider her actions. But there is no on-screen justification for this sudden change of heart, no conversation between characters, no evidence that Ellie’s past actions could be so abruptly halted in this moment. Only flashing memories of Joel.\nThe game attempts to address this lack of revenge at the finale by pitting Ellie in a violent brawl that results in Abby being stabbed and nearly drowned. Ellie’s flashbacks of Joel are meant to convey that, in this moment, she regains some of her humanity, some of the good that she saw in Joel, however vile his actions were. This ending just needed a few more narrative threads connecting Ellie’s actions and the player’s time spent with Abby together. Flashbacks cheapen the tenuous narrative justification for Ellie’s reaction here, and thus the tragedy of the game’s ending didn’t land as powerfully as it might have. I can’t escape the feeling that this game attempted to address the issue of ludonarrative dissonance so commonly held against Naughty Dog’s other games, but this game’s ending seems to have completely forgotten that aim to unite gameplay with storytelling. Here, the player has motivation to view Abby more complexly than the hundreds of people Ellie has killed to get here, but Ellie lacks that perspective entirely. And as a result of the (unfortunately) fun gameplay, it seems the developers entirely forgot about that human cost expended along the way towards Abby. This is a video game after all, ignoring the consequences of Ellie’s intermittently murderous actions. Thus when the drum finally stopped beating, “Revenge is bad,” there was no lesson to be learned, only relief that it was over. And I was left feeling resentful because of how close the game’s early hours came to perfection. I was floored that I felt no emotion at the game’s final cutscenes considering how invested I initially was.\nI Wish ‘The Last of Us Part II’ Was Never Made\nI hated my time with The Last of Us Part II. But this hatred reminded me of the aphorism that familiarity breeds contempt. I had spent seven years loving the dynamic relationship between Joel and Ellie, and though I knew it was going to be ripped apart, I didn’t know how little time I’d be spending with that relationship or those characters in the sequel. Instead, I was forced to care about someone that I never quite grew to like, spend far more time with them than was necessary for the moral arc of the narrative, and accept an ending for that character which felt flaccid. Along the way, I was tunneled through repetitive combat arenas that, no matter how well dressed, completely failed to reflect the moral considerations that the narrative attempts to establish.\nReporter Jason Schreier got himself in hot water with the pointedly vague but provocative tweet about Part II, “Video games are too long.” Actor Troy Baker responded in kind with a bizarre Roosevelt quote railing against the role that critics have in the industry. While it must be maddening to be on the receiving end of online vitriol for a video game you’ve worked on, I happen to agree with Schreier on this one, despite having a massive reverence for Baker’s acting abilities: video games are too long. The Last of Us Part II would be a better story if it was a third shorter, many moments of which could be trimmed from the time spent playing as Abby. Part II is frustrating precisely because of how much it got right. The narrative mistakes this game made completely soured my experience, causing me to sell my copy immediately after playing – something I had never done before. There is nothing for me to return to with this game, which as someone who has replayed the original game many times, is heartbreaking.\nUndoubtedly, The Last of Us Part II will be fondly remembered as the Playstation 4’s swan song in the way that the original Last of Us game was for the Playstation 3. Purely in terms of technical achievement, Part II is a must-play for owners of the current generation consoles, and our own Andy Webb reviewed this game as “groundbreaking.” But in terms of narrative, I almost wish that Part II was never made, that the original game would forever live on as lightning in a bottle, the one zombie game that rose to the cream of the crop in an overly saturated genre. And though the sequel has moments of greatness that occasionally top the original, Part II completely outstayed its welcome for me, leaving me cold at the idea of any future Last of Us games.\nThank you for reading.

            "text": "In Naughty Dog’s 2013 video game The Last of Us, a terrible disease swept the world, the American government began to kill its own citizens and survivors turned to tribalism. Seven years later, that once distant dystopia doesn’t feel so farfetched, and the game’s long-awaited sequel, The Last of Us Part II (out June 19), may prove a more difficult sell for even die-hard gamers at this particularly trying moment.\nThe first game was a stunning accomplishment that pushed the bounds of the format. Players witnessed the apocalypse primarily through the eyes of Joel (Troy Baker), who escorted a 14-year-old named Ellie (Ashley Johnson), the only known person immune to zombie bites, from Boston to a hospital in Seattle where doctors were attempting to develop a vaccine. Joel grew fond of Ellie during the journey. Even as they dodged the undead and, scarier still, the living, their banter buoyed the dark game: They discussed Ellie’s love of comic books and corny knock-knock jokes as they explored the bombed-out remains of schools and apartment complexes. Without Joel and Ellie’s touching relationship, The Last of Us would have been little more than a ripoff of The Road.\nJoel and Ellie’s bond proves essential in the final chapter of the original game, hailed by many critics as a perfect ending, when Joel realizes that Ellie will die in the operation necessary to create a vaccine and decides to stage an escape. When I first played, I tried to find ways to save an unconscious Ellie without brutally murdering dozens of doctors and nurses. But eventually, I realized that killing unarmed medical workers was the only way to beat the game. It’s a horrifying and complicated moment for the player, and it’s unclear how the forthcoming HBO TV adaptation, a collaboration between the game’s director and the creator of HBO’s similarly harrowing Chernobyl, will be able to capture that same feeling for a passive viewer.\nThe genius of the game was that the story gradually built toward one final moment that forced the player to reckon with whether the nominal hero of the story was, in fact, a villain. In the sequel, however, the player is asked to commit ethically dubious acts not just once, but on a minute-to-minute basis, diminishing the power of what is sure to be a controversial finale.\nThis time, we play primarily as Ellie, now 19 years old and on a mission that I won’t spoil in a war-torn Seattle. The city has become a battleground where the militant Washington Liberation Front faces off against a cult that goes by the name the Saraphites. It’s an engrossing world: The graphics are beautiful, the motion-capture faces gorgeously rendered. The mechanics of the original Last of Us were always a little clunky and cumbersome, but moving through the world of The Last of Us Part II is seamless. Weapons and tools are still scarce, and the game still encourages stealth over confrontation. Still, when Ellie does come to blows with an enemy, the fighting is fluid yet challenging.\nAnd fight, she does. The single-minded Ellie will shoot, bludgeon or shank anyone who gets in her way, regardless of political ideology. Enemies who, in games like Grand Theft Auto or Naughty Dog’s own Uncharted, would remain nameless and faceless get sympathetic backstories here. After you kill them, one of their friends might call out their name in anguish, compounding your guilt. The Washington Liberation Front uses dogs to hunt Ellie down, and while occasionally the player can circumvent these animals, too often you have to kill them too. (See also: Chernobyl.) The story is so dreary and cynical that some of Naughty Dog’s own developers protested the direction the game was taking, according to Naughty Dog’s head Neil Druckmann.\nBut if Naughty Dog’s intent was to shock, leaning so heavily on the violence has the opposite effect: 30 hours into the game, it’s easy to grow numb to acts of cruelty. That awe-inducing scenery and careful character-building is lost in macabre action. And while the violence of the first game served a compelling moral tale, the over-the-top bloodshed of Part II is all in service of a rather clichéd and tiresome lesson about the endless cycle of revenge. The banter that elevated the first game above mere dystopian fantasy is gone too, as Ellie often navigates this ultra-violent world on her own. It makes for a lonely, depressing experience at a moment when many of us are already feeling lonely and depressed.\nStill, it’s a rare AAA video game that will take any sort of risk — and Naughty Dog takes a lot of risks. For some, it will be worth enduring dozens of hours of harrowing gameplay to experience a blockbuster game attempting to break the mold, whether or not most players are satisfied with the ending. Antiheroes aren’t new to video games, but Naughty Dog pushes the concept to its edge, shifting the player’s perspective in compelling, if sometimes frustrating, scenes.\nAnd it’s no small thing that Naughty Dog decided to primarily tell this story not with the typical white, straight, male antihero, but a gay woman. Ellie’s bisexual girlfriend Dina and a trans character (whose identity I’m not permitted to spoil) also play major roles. The women in the game don’t have the buxom bodies still popular among many game developers, but realistic and varied builds. This sort of diversity is still radical for a mainstream video game, though the core cast of characters remains primarily white, and the game avoids any acknowledgment of the glaring racial divide in this country, which would not simply dissipate in a post-apocalyptic world.\nStill, explorations of sexism, homophobia and transphobia in the game open up new avenues that have largely been missing from mainstream video games. A concerted effort by the #gamergate movement has pushed back against any video game company that dares to expand its perspective in these ways. Even as notable female-led video games have impressed fans and critics (including recent triumphs like Horizon Zero Dawn and Control), little progress has been made. Last year, the website Feminist Frequency found that the number of video games with female protagonists at the E3 Expo (the premiere video game expo) was lower in 2019 than it was in 2015 when the #gamergate movement caught fire.\nUnsurprisingly, The Last of Us II has garnered its fair share of trolls even before its release. After a trailer that featured a kiss between Ellie and Dina dropped in 2018, outrage began to brew among a small but loud contingent of fans online. A few weeks before Naughty Dog was set to release the game, footage and details of the plot leaked. As plot twists went viral, Naughty Dog’s social media channels and employees’ personal accounts were flooded with sexist, homophobic and transphobic slurs, forcing the company to disable commenting.\nSome toxic YouTubers and Reddit posters have advocated for boycotting the game for a host of suspect reasons. Some are unhappy that they would have to play as a queer 19-year-old girl rather than a grizzled middle-aged man they know and love — a complaint that mirrors fans’ outrage over the death of Luke Skywalker and the ascendence of his protégé Rey in the Star Wars series. Others have balked at what they label as Naughty Dog’s progressive political agenda, which they claim was influenced by feminists they call SJWs (social justice warriors). These arguments are usually wrapped up in complaints about Naughty Dog’s bold plotting decisions, and it’s hard to untangle the real gripes about story from political agenda.\nThese trolls are following a well-worn playbook: They bully anyone associated with an old property, once dominated by straight white men, that has since evolved. The disturbing thing is, they often win: After angry Ghostbusters fans protested the all-female reboot by lobbing racist and sexist slurs at comedian Leslie Jones, the studio greenlit a new Ghostbusters sequel that ignores the existence of the film starring Jones. After trolls harassed Star Wars actress Kelly Marie Tran to the point where she left social media, Tran got all but written out of the last installment of Star Wars.\nUnlike the movie studios that have capitulated to fan demands, Naughty Dog, to its credit, has refused to budge on its commitment to all aspects of The Last of Us Part II. On the game’s press tour, Druckmann has repeatedly said that diversifying the story’s characters has allowed them to create a more interesting narrative — though he’s also warned fans that this particular story will not be “comfort food.” If those who embrace it are ultimately let down by its unrelenting bleakness, they can at least take heart in the possibility that it’s paved the way for something just as groundbreaking — and a little more optimistic — to follow in its footsteps.\n- Meet the TIME100: The Most Influential People of 2023\n- In Succession's Norway Episode, Lukas Matsson Plays the Roy Kids Perfectly\n- Big Tech Is Already Lobbying to Water Down Europe's AI Rules\n- The Problem With Shopping at Family Dollar and Dollar Tree\n- Column: How America Lost the COVID-19 War\n- Ray Romano Made a Movie for Sports Parents Everywhere\n- How Thailand's Deputy Prime Minister Pushed Through Asia's First Cannabis Legislation\n- Everything to Know About King Charles III's Coronation",

            "text": "The Last of Us Part 2 Review: A Gritty, Gruesome Sequel About Revenge\nThe Last of Us Part 2 is a follow-up to one of the most beloved video games ever made. Does it live up to the massive expectations? Read our review!\nIt’s easy to forget the kind of climate in which the original The Last of Us was released. While 2013 marked an era when games like Beyond: Two Souls inundated us with alternate endings and Bioshock Infinite was still fiddling around with a karma system, Naughty Dog’s post-apocalyptic road trip across America was notable for being unwaveringly committed to a single narrative. There were no dialogue options in sight.\nSeven years later, the same is true for this second part, which Naughty Dog creative director Neil Druckmann famously teased is “about hate” this time around rather than love. Up until recently, we could only speculate as to what this statement meant exactly. But now, after completing this 20-hour follow-up journey, the final product is much grimmer and far more disturbing than even returning players might be prepared for. Pacing issues aside, The Last of Us Part II is a grueling experience first and a third-person action game second that asks who exactly are the real monsters when the world ends: them or us?\nTaking place four years after its predecessor, we catch up with Ellie and Joel, who’ve taken on roles within the remote, walled-off settlement of Jackson, Wyoming. Both have matured a lot since we last saw them, not always for the better, as Joel is still struggling with being too overprotective of his surrogate daughter while Ellie attempts to form new relationships and questions her place in the world. It’s clear that the previous game’s gut-punch ending has caused a rift of trust between the two, and it isn’t long before Joel’s actions spell disaster for the pair and lead to a horrific inciting event.\nWhat follows is a revenge quest of the most bitter proportions, centering on a hate-fuelled Ellie as she ventures to a post-apocalyptic Seattle that’s being ripped apart by civil war as well as the ravaging Cordyceps virus. Letting you roam, explore, and investigate this nook of a city is one of the best things The Last of Us Part II has going for it, setting it distinctly apart from the state-spanning jaunt depicted in the original game and laying the foundation for Ellie to get more intimate with just one setting. And what a setting it is!\nNaughty Dog’s ability for nigh on perfect environmental storytelling has been never called into question, but The Last of Us Part II takes the concept much further. Decimated music stores smack of unused instruments and songs never written, an innocent-looking courthouse features its own underground secrets, and even the once-proud city bank reeks of a heist job gone wrong during outbreak day – before it succumbed to infected investigators. It’s not that hard to piece these bite-sized stories together, and not once do you question whether locations like these feel lived-in. All this you discover through the simple act of exploration.\nThe technical panache continues when looking at the improvements made to character models both during gameplay and in cutscenes. Never before have the performances of Troy Baker, Ashley Johnson et al been so keenly felt, especially during the brief moments of quiet where you’re afforded the chance to take in every subtle bite of the lip or eye-flicker. In a year where Resident Evil 3 impressed with its new renditions of Jill and Carlos thanks to the power of the RE Engine, The Last of Us Part II easily usurps it by pushing the PS4’s graphical capability to its absolute limit.\nSomething tells us you’ll be hard-pressed to find another AAA game in 2020 able to so effortlessly convince you that the characters you’re watching are real. The Last of Us Part II uses this graphical flair to great effect, combining it with a general fondness for cinematic framing and thoughtful writing so that you always feel engrossed n what’s happening on screen. Regrettably, this does also mean that it’s not uncommon to wince or look away when the violence being depicted dips into the overtly gruesome.\nRelease Date: June 19, 2020\nPlatform: PS4\nDeveloper: Naughty Dog\nPublisher: Sony Interactive Entertainment\nGenre: Action-adventure\nIn terms of the gameplay loop, not a lot has actually changed. It’s still the same satisfying mix of stealth, item crafting, and all-out melee violence the first game also handled well, as you go up against the various forms of infected creatures (one of which is new) or the handful of survivor factions. Quite surprisingly, it’s the latter group that Naughty Dog has chosen to revise most, as no longer do impromptu shootouts against human enemies feel so repetitive.\nIt used to be that you’d sneak around enemies, taking out as many as possible until all hell broke loose and you were forced to unload vital ammunition. Now, however, you might get away with doing this, to begin with, but there comes a point around about a quarter of the way through where dogs are able to track your scent, and then a cult-like faction of bandits is introduced. Known simply to Ellie as Scars, their ability to communicate across great distances by whistling and unhealthy affection for arrows often means facing them head-on won’t work. New elements like this, however slight, are a welcome change and reward a more strategic edge when approaching encounters.\nYou’ll likely find that said encounters are a lot more open this time too compared to those presented in the first game. This is because areas themselves span wider spaces and you can obscure yourself using tall grass now, yes, but also adding a new sense of depth are Ellie’s abilities to jump and (at long last) swim. Whereas previous combat scenarios would force you to stealth or fight across a single plane, Seattle is full of structures available for you to clamber over and drop down from – ideal for when you want to flank snipers or gain a better vantage point from above. The Last of Us Part II has learned a lot from its sister series, Uncharted, in this regard.\nUnfortunately, for as enthralling as The Last of Us Part II can be, it’s far from a flawless experience, and this is largely a result of poor pacing. 20 hours is a long time to spend reveling in a narrative as oppressive as this, let alone for one so linear. That’s why it’s a shame that an unexpected perspective shift occurring around the midpoint disrupts what is until then a great sense of urgency and flow. Ellie’s bitter momentum is suddenly paused for another side story, and I’d be lying if I said it wasn’t jarring.\nWithout getting too spoilery (check out our spoiler-filled discussion here), all we’ll say is that Naughty Dog’s decision to have this story take place primarily over days rather than seasons leads the game to box itself in a bit during the second half. It results in a B plot that is certainly compelling, although it really suffers from a serious bout of what we’ll call “side quest-itus.” This portion of the game is important to explore the idea of the other, what holding a grudge can do to you, and most importantly the moral gray area that sits between right and wrong, but it’s hard not to feel like these points could have been relayed in a more succinct manner. As a book it may have worked; as a game it just comes off as bloat.\nWhereas some modern games these days seem like they’re made by committee and aimed at the broadest audience possible, one of The Last of Us Part II’s biggest triumphs is that it feels noticeably authored. That’s a rare quality to see in a AAA release and Naughty Dog has done it twice now, only made more impressive when you consider that the tale being weaved is also very novel and like nothing produced at this level before. It may sometimes forget that it’s a game first and foremost, best evidenced in its ill-pacing, but for the most part, this dark descent into the bitter acts revenge will lead us to is simultaneously gripping, heart-wrenching, and oddly prescient.\nOnly time will tell whether The Last of Us Part II will be remembered as fondly as its predecessor. For now, however, even if its experimental structure ultimately does more harm than good, Naughty Dog’s much bleaker sequel is primed to stay with you long after you’ve turned off your PS4.",

I loved the rhythms and structure of the game, and as one of the final big shows for the PlayStation 4 it makes me wonder why we’re even bothering with a “next generation” at all. \n \n              PS4\n             \n \n \n Game Informer  -  Andy McNamara \n \n              100 ~  10 / 10 \n \n The Last of Us Part II is a monumental achievement in video game storytelling \n \n              PS4\n             \n \n \n Game Rant  -  Anthony Taormina \n \n              100 ~  5 / 5 stars \n \n Developer Naughty Dog builds on its post-apocalyptic opus with The Last of Us Part 2, delivering incredible visuals and an emotional story. \n \n              PS4\n             \n \n \n GameSpew  -  Richard Seagrave \n \n              100 ~  10 / 10 \n \n The Last of Us Part II is Naughty Dog’s magnum opus; the result of years spent mastering its craft. \n \n              PS4\n             \n \n \n GamesRadar+  -  Alex Avard \n \n              100 ~  5 / 5 stars \n \n Naughty Dog's PS4 swansong is an astonishing, absurdly ambitious epic that goes far and beyond what we could have imagined for a sequel to an all-time classic. \n \n              PS4\n             \n \n \n GamingTrend  -  Ron Burke \n \n              100 ~  100 / 100 \n \n The Last of Us Part II is a stunningly beautiful and impeccably written story of family, consequences, horror, and loss. It pulls you in and holds tight, forging a deeper connection with Ellie, her fellow survivors, and the hostile world in which they live. From start to finish, this could be the best game on the PlayStation 4 -- ever. \n \n              PS4\n             \n \n \n Hardcore Gamer  -  Kevin Dunsmore \n \n              100 ~  5 / 5 \n \n The Last of Us left a memorable impression. \n \n              PS4\n             \n \n \n IGN  -  Jonathon Dornbush \n \n              100 ~  10 / 10 \n \n The Last of Us Part 2 is a masterpiece that evolves the gameplay, cinematic storytelling, and rich world design of the original in nearly every way. \n \n              PS4\n             \n \n \n Next Gen Base  -  Ben Ward \n \n              100 ~  10 / 10 \n \n The Last of Us Part 2 makes some bold moves. Whether it’s from a story perspective or a gameplay one, Naughty Dog haven’t been afraid to make some big leaps with this game. Fortunately, it’s almost all for the better, and the result is a game that is as diverse as it is challenging, with visuals that I can’t see being beaten until the new consoles hit, and a story that will raise some eyebrows but ultimately sticks the landing, in spite of how dark it can get. A magnificent example of what is capable in the medium of video games. We absolutely needed this sequel. \n \n              PS4\n             \n \n \n PlayStation Universe  -  John-Paul Jones \n \n              100 ~  10 / 10 \n \n The Last of Us Part 2 is a frankly incredible achievement. Intertwining deep, richly written characters, cementing themes of consequence and loss all the while widening a world that was so well established in the first game, Naughty Dog have crafted one of the finest action adventures of all time and one that invariably stands as the most opulent jewel in an already glittering crown of first-party PlayStation 4 exclusives. \n \n              PS4\n             \n \n \n Push Square  -  Sammy Barker \n \n              100 ~  10 / 10 \n \n The Last of Us: Part II adds a couple more inches to the already outrageously high bar that Naughty Dog has set for itself. This is the developer's crowning achievement to date, expanding and improving upon the concepts that it's been iterating on for over a decade now. Unparalleled presentation combines with an engaging gameplay loop that puts you in the shoes of its characters – and forces you to feel all of the tension and misgivings of its cast. It's uncomfortable and not everyone will necessarily enjoy its direction, but that's ultimately what makes it so essential. \n \n              PS4\n             \n \n \n Tech Advisor  -  Dominic Preston \n \n              100 ~  5 / 5 stars \n \n The Last of Us Part II is not a perfect game, and it’s not even a particularly revolutionary one. But it is a great game. \n \n              PS4\n             \n \n \n Telegraph  -  Dan Silver \n \n              100 ~  5 / 5 stars \n \n Sony's big budget PS4 exclusive might actually surpass the achievements of its illustrious predecessor \n \n              PS4\n             \n \n \n TheSixthAxis  -  Jim Hargreaves \n \n              100 ~  10 / 10 \n \n The Last of Us Part II is a remorseless epic delivering in its masterful storytelling, nail-biting gameplay and unrivalled production values. Naughty Dog have truly surpassed themselves yet again, crafting a heartfelt sequel that will leave you gasping as they continue to raise the bar for the video game industry. It's yet another must-buy for PlayStation 4 owners, supercharging Sony's unstoppable stable of exclusives. \n \n              PS4\n             \n \n \n VG247  -  Kirk McKeand \n \n              100 ~  5 / 5 stars \n \n When the credits rolled on The Last of Us Part 2 I was still buzzing from the excitement of the final few hours. \n \n              PS4\n             \n \n \n Can I Play That?  -  Courtney Craven \n \n              100 ~  10 / 10 \n \n A shockingly accessible and incredible game that will prove to be truly barrier free for very many disabled players. If I could rate things higher than 10, I would. \n \n              PS4\n             \n \n \n Geek Culture  -  Jake Su \n \n              98 ~  9.8 / 10 \n \n The Last of Us Part II justifies its existence with a truly stunning delivery of a strong narrative, coupled with great gameplay, and excellent worldbuilding. \n \n              PS4\n             \n \n \n Easy Allies  -  Michael Huber \n \n              95 ~  9.5 / 10 \n \n The Last of Us Part II is an utterly essential tale about love and hate that takes a challenging look below the surface.   Written \n \n              PS4\n             \n \n \n GamesBeat  -  Dean Takahashi \n \n              95 ~  95 / 100 \n \n The improvements that Naughty Dog made in gameplay and graphics showed that they were able to completely overhaul a system that wasn't all that bad to begin with, and the result was gameplay that kept me entertained even though it was the longest game that Naughty Dog had ever made. As I said, the action in this game is intense, grueling, and raw. \n \n              PS4\n             \n \n \n Paste Magazine  -  Natalie Flores \n \n              95 ~  9.5 / 10 \n \n I wish I could say something more eloquent than that I have an already immeasurable amount of love for The Last of Us Part II. \n \n              PS4\n             \n \n \n Press Start  -  Brodie Gibbons \n \n              95 ~  9.5 / 10 \n \n The Last of Us Part II is a spectacular sequel, it’s a brave and unexpected direction for the series, expanding on the world both narratively and mechanically, producing a far sounder and rounded experience that never falters or gets in the way of the game’s clear storytelling strength. \n \n              PS4\n             \n \n \n Sirus Gaming  -  Jarren Navarrete \n \n              95 ~  9.5 / 10 \n \n The Last of Us Part II is rather daring when it comes to its narrative. It tells a very mature tale of revenge and what the effects of civilization crashing down has brought on humanity. At times, it will push you out of your comfort zone as we see people being tortured, mutilated, and brutalized by even the protagonist herself. \n \n              PS4\n             \n \n \n Wccftech  -  Kai Powell \n \n              95 ~  9.5 / 10 \n \n The Last of Us Part II is bleak and at times leaves the player feeling hopeless as they play through one of the finest crafted pieces of gaming ever to grace a home console. This is one game that people will be talking about for a long time. \n \n              PS4\n             \n \n \n WellPlayed  -  Zach Jackson \n \n              95 ~  9.5 / 10 \n \n Featuring generation-defining game design, The Last of Us Part II is an unrivalled masterpiece that stumbles ever so slightly under its own ambitions \n \n              PS4\n             \n \n \n CGMagazine  -  Cole Watson \n \n              90 ~  9 / 10 \n \n The Last of Us Part II is a perfectly paced emotional rollercoaster ride from start to finish and a worthy sequel that lives up to the original. \n \n              PS4\n             \n \n \n Gadgets 360  -  Akhil Arora \n \n              90 ~  9 / 10 \n \n The Last of Us 2 delivers where it counts. It's oppressing, it's brutal, and it's a sucker punch, by way of the positions it puts you in to drive home what a change of perspective can do. As it's said, every villain is the hero of their own story — and vice versa. \n \n              PS4\n             \n \n \n GameByte  -  Lara Jackson \n \n              90 ~  9 / 10 stars \n \n Whether you love or hate The Last of Us Part 2, it’s guaranteed to be a game that keeps people talking for years to come. \n \n              PS4\n             \n \n \n Gamerheadquarters  -  Jason Stettner \n \n              90 ~  9 / 10 \n \n The Last of Us Part II is the definitive technical achievement for the Playstation 4, it does a beautiful job of humanizing the characters as well as their perspectives. \n \n              PS4\n             \n \n \n Metro GameCentral   -   GameCentral \n \n              90 ~  9 / 10 \n \n A milestone in action video game storytelling and while the gameplay is not nearly as inspired, the experience as a whole is one of the best of the generation. \n \n              PS4\n             \n \n \n Rocket Chainsaw  -  Adam Ghiggino \n \n              90 ~  4.5 / 5 stars \n \n As a swan-song for the PS4, The Last of Us Part II is a belter \n \n              PS4\n             \n \n \n Shacknews  -  Josh Hawkins \n \n              90 ~  9 / 10 \n \n An unforgettable experience that rivals some of the greatest classics in American cinema. \n \n              PS4\n             \n \n \n Spiel Times  -  Caleb Wysor \n \n              90 ~  9 / 10 \n \n Sprawling, unrelenting, but always fascinating, The Last of Us Part II is a disturbingly effective fable. \n \n              PS4\n             \n \n \n USgamer  -  Kat Bailey \n \n              90 ~  4.5 / 5 stars \n \n The Last of Us Part 2 is an outstanding action game; a darker, more introspective follow-up that seeks to challenge the conventions of big-budget action games. In this it's not always successful, but its execution is impeccable, and its story proves an appropriate bookend to the story of Joel and Ellie. In short, it's some of Naughty Dog's best work. \n \n              PS4\n             \n \n \n Video Chums  -  A.J. Maciejewski \n \n              90 ~  9 / 10 \n \n While the end credits rolled, I felt hollow, hopeless, frustrated, and downright disgusted. I'll never play through it again. With that being said; there's no denying that what The Last of Us Part II accomplishes with its visuals, mood, and gameplay is nothing short of amazing. \n \n              PS4\n             \n \n \n VideoGamer  -  Joshua Wise \n \n              90 ~  9 / 10 \n \n Where it succeeds isn't in how close it scrapes to the level of prestige TV, or to films. Its coup is not, \"Look how closely we can make games resemble highbrow art.\" It's more, \"Look what previously fenced-off realms we can get interactivity into.\" \n \n              PS4\n             \n \n \n PowerUp!  - David Milner\n             \n              88 ~  8.8 / 10 \n \n A fantastic stealth combat experience with an astonishing sense of place and character. It’s brave, bold, brutal, and unrelentingly bleak \n \n              PS4\n             \n \n \n Destructoid  -  Chris Carter \n \n              85 ~  8.5 / 10 \n \n Like the original Last of Us, some people are going to come away underwhelmed, but the story beats and the characters driving them are the main draw. Part II doesn't reinvent the wheel, but it gives us a lasting glimpse of a unique broken world full of broken people that's worth visiting time and time again. \n \n              PS4\n             \n \n \n Glitched Africa  -  Marco Cocomello \n \n              85 ~  8.5 / 10 \n \n While the game’s plot has some major holes in it and never actually gets anywhere, the gameplay has seen a major improvement. It is also one of the most visually captivating games on the market and at times I could not believe it was running on the hardware. The Last Of Us Part II is a game you would want to play and you should. Even if it is once. It will play with your emotions and deliver some intense inner conflict. The series is known for. It is just a pity the plot was trying so hard to be outstanding it often feels rushed and forgettable. \n \n              PS4\n             \n \n \n GameSpot  -  Kallie Plagge \n \n              80 ~  8 / 10 \n \n The Last of Us Part II is messy, bleak, and brutal. \n \n              PS4\n             \n \n \n New Game Network  -  Alex Varankou \n \n              80 ~  80 / 100 \n \n The Last of Us Part II offers more of the same great stealth gameplay, as you face overwhelming odds in increasingly challenging and haunting environments. But with an ambitiously structured narrative that doesn't pay off, and the new cast lacking chemistry, this adventure can't quite live up to its predecessor. \n \n              PS4\n             \n \n \n Stevivor  -  Steve Wright \n \n              80 ~  8 / 10 \n \n If I’ve sounded at odds over The Last of Us Part 2, that’s because I am. It won’t only be polarising between players, it will be divisive with your own emotions. When looking at gameplay it’s best in class, but a host of design and narrative decisions truly bring it down. \n \n              PS4\n             \n \n \n Video Game Sophistry  -  Andy Borkowski \n \n              80 ~  8 / 10 \n \n As the game reaches the top of what this generation of video games can do, it also shows the pitfalls of this AAA approach. The Last of Us Part 2 is in many ways at war with itself.  It achieves things that I have never experienced in a video game, but it is so tied to the tonal story, of hate and humanism that it punishes the player for doing anything that doesn’t follow this strict arch. \n \n              PS4\n             \n \n \n Game Revolution  -  Michael Leri \n \n              70 ~  3.5 / 5 stars \n \n The first half’s semi-aimless and methodical pacing drags in its latter half as it bites off more story than it can comfortably chew and then spends too many hours trying to flesh out each one of its many beats. \n \n              PS4\n             \n \n \n \n    Thanks OpenCritic for initial export\n   \n \n \n \n      Read more\n         \n \n \n \n \n \n      Archived post.

            "text": "The Last Of Us 2 review - a stunning and incredibly dark game\nBy Jordan Middler // BBC The Social contributor\nAfter years of anticipation, and several delays, The Last of Us Part II is finally here. The sequel to 2013’s Game of the Year, The Last of Us Part II this time follows Ellie as she travels across Seattle in search of the original protagonist; Joel’s brother, Tommy.\nSet four years after the original, players take control of a much more mature Ellie and have to deal with not only the threat of the infected that permeate the land, but Ellie’s personal relationships and a mysterious cult that haunts Seattle.\nThe Last Of Us Part II Review\nJordan Middler delves into the story, themes, relationships and the gameplay.\nOriginally announced in 2016, the game was delayed several times, most recently due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Not only that, but several weeks before release, large portions of the game leaked online, which according to Sony were the work of a rogue QA tester.\nRegardless of their origin, spoilers for the game sprung up across the internet causing fans to proceed with caution whenever the game was discussed pre-release. But now with only a week to go before the game is available around the world, I’ve spent a couple of weeks playing through it to see if all of the anticipation was merited.\nYou can check out our full review above, but if you’re looking for a short answer ; yes, and then some.\nThe Last of Us Part II is one of the most incredible games I’ve ever played.\nIt’s taken the survival horror gameplay from the first game and expanded it by making encounters more challenging and giving players a wider arsenal with which to manoeuvre them. From a narrative perspective, writers Neil Druckmann and Halley Gross have crafted a story that’s gripping and emotionally exhausting.\nAshley Johnson’s performance as Ellie is incredible and the trials the character faces will have fans of the original and new players glued to their screens.\nIt’s also an incredibly dark game. The theme’s The Last Of Us Part II explores are not for the faint of heart and plenty of the violence in the game is extremely uncomfortable.\nHowever, where ultra-violence in other games is used as a comic tool or simply for shock, The Last Of Us Part II uses it to further reinforce its themes and sense of realism. This is helped by graphics that are unlikely to be surpassed this generation.\nIt’s a stunning game that’ll have players talking for years to come.",

            "text": "The release of The Last of Us Part 1 for the PS5 has gotten everybody talking about whether it's worth its full $70 price tag, most of the time. And in the chaos of the debates, I decided to go back and finish the game that Naughty Dog used as a graphical and technical benchmark for TLOU1's remake: The Last of Us Part 2.\nTo say that this game is one of the most polarizing ever made is a massive understatement. ND had tons of pressure on them to follow up on the success of their first masterpiece, and many people believed they dropped the ball with the sequel. A quick Google search will make you understand what I'm talking about.\nBut even if there were several instances where Naughty Dog DID drop the ball, The Last of Us Part 2 is still a harrowing, human, thoughtful video game experience. I'm not here to try to convince you to like the game if you didn't gravitate to it the first time around, but with the recent release of the remade The Last of Us Part 1, I feel like it's not too late to share my thoughts on TLOU2 in my 2022 review.\nThe Price of Revenge\nTLOU2 was not made to revolutionize gameplay. It's not even close. I'd even go as far as to say that ND's gameplay mechanics should go back to 2013, right where it belongs. But it's the story, despite its flaws, that captivated me in a way very few games have done. And there were several moments (a lot of them, really) that elicited a physical response in me, to the point that those moments made me squeamish.\nThe main gist of this game's story, to me, is just how far you're willing to go for revenge. Revenge is a trope so overused in storytelling that it's not even funny. But so many stories miss the nitty gritty of this desire: is it really worth it? How far are you willing to go down the pit of madness and despair that comes with the feeling of loss and the desire to want some payback? Are you truly willing to become a monster to defeat the monster you've always had at the back of your mind?\nAside from that, there's also the fact that the hero, despite the game being designed to make you feel for them (in this case, Ellie and Abby), performs actions that ALWAYS have consequences. There were multiple times when I felt good about Ellie's kills, but then a few hours later, I'd see the consequences of the deed. The same thing goes for Abby. I always said during my playthrough that The Last of Us Part 2 played so much with my emotions that I felt exhausted after the fact.\nAll in all, this just goes to show that the world of The Last of Us 2 has no happy endings. You choose this path of darkness that comes with revenge, and you'll face the consequences. And that's what happened to Ellie in the end. She often said that she was scared of being alone. And at the end of this game, the price of vengeance rears its ugly head. No winners, just losers. This is the horror of e devastating global pandemic that has not only unraveled society in this game but bared the bloody, disgusting visage of humans whenever they get pushed over the edge.\nWhen I finally finished the game, I just felt empty. It might be that I never accomplished my main goal as Ellie. One could say that she failed. I don't know if this ending was for the best for all the characters involved, but if Naughty Dog wanted me to feel real human emotions, they succeeded. By a mile.\nScrounging for Scraps\nOn the gameplay side, this The Last of Us Part 2 review won't be as kind. I said earlier that these gameplay mechanics are already so old by this point, and ND did almost nothing to redesign the wheel. There are some aspects that I liked, sure, but overall, the gameplay loop feels dated and stale, and I often found myself wanting to get to the story bits ASAP because I never cared much about anything else.\nCombat in this game, as I'd put it, is better than the original game. But it's still far below what I'd expect from a sequel that was released seven years after the first game. One could never say that Naughty Dog \"didn't have enough time\" to innovate and make things far more interesting. They DID have enough time, and they still didn't deliver. It's a disappointment, to be sure.\nThe only noteworthy additions to the combat are the fact that Abby and Ellie's loadouts differ greatly from each other. This ensures that the two don't play and \"feel\" the same, more so during the intense firefights against humans and the infected. Aside from that, the addition of the new faction called the Seraphites/Scars give encounters a refreshing feel. When these guys are out, you truly feel like you're the one being hunted. Their whistle calls and silent bows are threatening all on their own, and the fact that they're a fanatical cult who's ready to die at any moment gives their attacks so much more gravitas.\nRead also: New PS5 Releases Bring Lighter Console-Different from 2020-2021 Releases\nOther additions to the combat include the new types of Infected enemies, which, for all intents and purposes, are still the same old stuff. Clickers are still Clickers, Runners, and so forth. While it can be pretty challenging in its own right, the Shambler enemy type is still far from innovative as it feels like a downgraded Bloater. As for the notorious Rat King? Well, the design is terrifying - but it also didn't add anything substantial to the combat besides making you just want to run away, reposition, scrounge up resources to craft bombs and ammo, and blast this thing until it's dead. I've seen that gameplay loop so many times before.\nI would be a prude, however, if I didn't commend the game's massive list of accessibility options. There's a lot to unpack in just one paragraph, but the main thing about it is this: with these options, you can customize the game to make its gameplay run however you want. Annoyed with puzzles? Toggle the \"skip puzzle\" option. Annoyed by how the allies need saving from enemies grabbing them every ten seconds? There's a toggle for that too. To me, the fact that ND even cared to even ensure that people from all walks of life, skill levels, and commitment can play this game in their own way is nothing short of amazing. And really, you have to see these accessibility options to believe it.\nOutside of these things, I can't commend anything else about The Last of Us Part 2's combat. There's simply nothing spectacular happening here.\nA Paradise Beneath the Destruction\nTo say that The Last of Us Part 2 looks amazing is an understatement. Once more, the team at Naughty dog delivers on the world-building and environmental design aspects. Very few game worlds, even those featuring huge open maps, can hold a candle to TLOU2's world in terms of detail.\nIn my previous reviews, I always talked about how the beauty of video games would make me stop and just marvel at the beautiful vista in front of me. While The Last of Us Part 2 didn't make me want to \"stop and smell the roses,\" so to speak, it was still one of the best-looking games I've seen. The main reason why I never stopped to look at the view is that the game's nature never lets you slow down. You're in a zombie apocalypse, duh. Though I would still say that the ruined husk of human society, despite its obvious ugliness, still hides a beauty within.\nCharacter models are also among the most detailed (if not THE most detailed) ones that I have ever seen. This is even more evident in the model viewer menu, which you can only access after you finish the main story for the first time. The sheer detail in every single bit of the characters' designs is mind-boggling to me. You don't see this much during the moment-to-moment gameplay, but in this mode, you get to see the kind of work Naughty Dog's character artists put into every single person in the game. They're the most believable-looking digital humans I've seen so far, and not a lot of games can hold a candle to them right now.\nBut since TLOU2 was made using last-gen hardware in mind, I'm imagining how this game would look if it got a dedicated next-gen version for the PS5. I did play it on the PS5, and while the 60 FPS update is nice, the game still looks decidedly last-gen and nowhere near what a true next-gen game's visuals have to offer. Granted, the game was released at the tail-end of the PS4 generation (with the PS5 still unreleased back then), so I don't have the right to complain.\nMaybe, though, JUST maybe: release a next-gen upgrade with new-gen features like ray-traced shadows, reflections, and lighting? That would be amazing. But I'm not holding my breath for it.\nMaking Do With What You Have\nI'd say that Naughty Dog managed to extract just a little bit more out of the PS4's aging hardware to make this game look the best it can be. I started playing The Last of Us Part 2 on the PS4 until I managed to get my own PS5 console, and the experience there was pretty smooth, all things considered. But the 60 FPS upgrade on the newer console makes all of the difference, more so during the hand-to-hand combat sequences where the smoother frame rate makes it easier to dodge and move around.\nThat's pretty much it on the technical side, really. My next and last comment is a nitpick, but even on the PS5, you could see that TLOU2 was a game made for last-gen hardware. I doubt Sony's new console even cracks a sweat running this game at resolutions beyond 1080p with 60 FPS. I feel like there's a ton of power wasted by not having a dedicated next-gen upgrade, but I digress.\nFinal Verdict\nI went into The Last of Us Part 2 well aware of the bad press about it. But instead, I found a game that was still pretty good despite the presence of flaws and aging gameplay mechanics. Still, it would've been a mediocre game had it not had a story worth sitting through - at least in my opinion. But on the subject of The Last of Us Part 1 already out, moving to this game from that will surely be not too much of a hassle now.\nSCORE: 7 out of 10\nRelated: [Esports] Most Trending Games on YouTube so Far in 2022",

            "text": "I Couldn’t Finish The Last Of Us Part 2 | A Review | Solely My Opinion\nWhen The Last of Us (TLOU) came out 7 years ago, I searched through every YouTube gameplay channel I could that had a bunch of parts uploaded because there was no way I could afford the game nor a console for it, so watching gameplays will suffice. I watched a couple of parts to get myself started and soon found myself binging as much as the creator put out.\nThe storyline was heartbreaking yet gripping, the gameplay was exciting albeit sometimes nonsensical when the NPCs were… less discrete than they should be but the ending was *chef’s kiss*.\nIf you don’t know anything about TLOU, you play as the character Joel, who lost his daughter during the initial Cordyceps fungus outbreak where it turned humans into zombies of different stages (the first being a normal zombie called ‘runners’ and the third stage ‘Clicker’ if you’re exposed to more spores — they eventually introduced 3 more stages with ‘Rat King’ being the final boss). And after surviving it, he became a smuggler.\nHe was tasked to smuggle a 14-year-old girl Ellie who has a bite mark but did not turn into a zombie — meaning she’s immune. He has to smuggle her across the US to a facility run by the Fireflies who wanted her so that they could create some kind of cure against this outbreak with her DNA.\nWe basically play as him, with different weapons from guns to bats. We could craft certain explosives and med-kits. Ellie is also equipped with a weapon and plays alongside us, occasionally assisting in a double-kill.\nBut honestly, the gameplay is… pretty simple. What makes it more unique and added flavour was the storyline and the graphics design. And oh boy was it really good.\nEvery cut scene you saw felt like you were watching a full-fledged animated movie. You could even watch all the cutscenes strung together at the end of the game, giving rise to about a 2 hour movie. The design, artwork and plot was just jaw-droppingly beautiful.\nTo me 7 years ago, the concept was unique. The storyline was gripping. The design was excellent. The direction of every cut scene paved way for a different kind of game design: one with an excellent storyline and graphics but ok gameplay.\nNow, let me warn you here: If you don’t know what happened at the end of TLOU, let alone haven’t played (or like me, watched) The Last Of Us Part 2 (TLOU2), you might want to miss out on this review until you’ve at least played until the biggest plot point in TLOU2 (and you’ll know what I mean by the biggest plot point) — because yes, I will be spoiling, so you’ve been warned!\nTo set the scene, at the end of TLOU, Joel and Ellie does reach the Fireflies’ lab, located in the St. Mary’s Hospital in Salt Lake City, Utah. There, as Ellie prepares for surgery, falling into deep sleep, Joel learns that the only way the Fireflies could even find a cure was if they cut open Ellie, killing her.\nHaving bonded with Ellie over the course of the cross-country trip, he runs into the surgical room, kills off all the surgeons (yikes) and leaves with Ellie in his arms.\nAfter leaving the hospital, Joel lied to a waking Ellie about the Fireflies not needing her because she wasn’t the right person for the cure, but eventually she finds out the truth because she took a trip back to the hospital to find evidence in TLOU2.\n4 years after TLOU left off, TLOU2 begins in Jackson, Wyoming where Joel, Ellie and Tommy (Joel’s brother) resides in a surviving community. Joel and Ellie’s relationship now strained from what happened 4 years ago.\nEllie was recently placed on pair patrols with a new character Dina (who eventually becomes Ellie’s love interest) and we begin the gameplay with them going around the different patrol points, finding hordes of zombies coming closer to Jackson as the zombies were migrating due to the weather.\nFor a split moment in the gameplay, we suddenly hop into a new character Abby. Man, she’s buff as heck. I almost thought it was some kind of modelling render flaw but naw, she somehow found steroids during the post-apocalypse and you know she’s been training hella hard, so major props to her.\nAbby was with her group of friends, hiding out in a mansion close enough to Jackson and they were there for a reason. Owen, a previous lover of Abby’s (who got another character, Mel pregnant, who for whatever reason was also in that group hiding out in the mansion despite her being preggo), took Abby out one morning to show her that they were near Jackson.\nIt didn’t take long to put two and two together to understand that Abby was looking for Joel. At the last minute, Owen backed out of wanting to pursue Joel and the people in Jackson because of Mel’s situation. He wanted to take everyone back because they didn’t have any plan in mind. Abby obviously got pissed and so she left her entire team in pursuit of Joel alone.\nShe eventually found herself in a huge horde of Runners and while trying to out run them, she was saved by Joel and Tommy, who were on their pair patrols. They eventually escaped the horde and Abby brought both of them back to the mansion.\nAnd here, the biggest plot point happened and also when I started to lose interest in the entire series.\nWe switch back to Ellie and found out from another new character, Jesse, that Joel and Tommy did not reach their designated exchange point. The 3 split up, yes, all of them separated, to find both of them… even though there were clear signs of hordes of zombies moving into Jackson!! SIGH.\nEventually Ellie found the mansion where Abby held Joel and Tommy hostage. As Ellie snuck in, she saw a battered and bloodied Joel in the hands of Abby, while Tommy was knocked out cold in the corner.\nThere was a huge struggle as we watched from Ellie’s perspective, Abby killing Joel.\nAll the anger, disbelief and plenty of other emotions bubbled to the surface as I thought: what the fuck? Did they actually fucking kill off Joel?!\nI was in disbelief the entire time Ellie and the people in Jackson came to terms with Joel’s death. And at this point, it felt almost pointless to continue watching. I mean, I watched TLOU simply because I loved the relationship Ellie and Joel had. Despite it being strained at the start of TLOU2, I was hoping we could see progress in their relationship. But no?! Instead they kill off such an important character and placed Ellie on a killing spree??!! INSERT ANOTHER SIGH, AND A REAL BIG ONE.\nAfter Joel’s death, Tommy leaves Jackson in pursuit of Abby and her team. Ellie and Dina follow in his tracks and found themselves in Seattle.\nAt this point, the plot simply became: Get justice for Joel by finding Abby in Seattle or at least find Tommy and bring him back. But we’ll always narrowly miss Abby or Tommy and instead Ellie and Dina does something else.\nThe entire gameplay became: go through this portion of the map — which, ok, props to the map designer because they really made the map huge. There are multiple areas within the entire game where you could probably spend half an hour to an hour just exploring every building that’s accessible — to fight zombies or loot, before you continued with the main storyline.\nBut that’s all you do — you loot around for things, be stealthy, solve some simple puzzles that required you to move things around so that you could hop a fence, kill people with various weapons, create silenced weapons, create med-kits, rinse and repeat.\nAlthough there’s an added category of being able to ‘level-up’ Ellie by feeding her medication you found (yikes, I know, just popping random-ass meds?! In the post-apocalyptic world?!) or picking up some kind of book/magazine that unlocks a secret category— she could hear better, she could walk more silently, she could be more resilient to attacks, etcetera — all of that was interesting until you realise that that’s pretty much all you do.\nIt got so fucking boring. And quick.\nIt also doesn’t help that none of your choices you make really impacted the gameplay in any shape. Sure, there are some flashback scenes that you’ll only manage to see if you explored, which is kind of nice — rewarding the player for exploring. But apart from that slight reprieve you get from the flashbacks… it doesn’t change much. Ellie doesn’t back out of her pursuit, or learn any new information that could’ve changed the outcome of the story. You couldn’t even say ‘no, Ellie, let’s not do this anymore. Let’s just find Tommy and turn back.’\nAnd this goes on until you finally meet Abby, pointing a gun at Tommy, because Ellie killed Owen, a preggo Mel and some of Abby’s other friends — all of which you couldn’t stop Ellie from doing.\nAND YOU KNOW WHAT? It gets worse.\nBecause now you play as Abby for the rest of the game. You learn about Abby’s history from her own flashbacks. You learn that Abby’s father was one of the surgeons killed by Joel in his fit of rage trying to save Ellie.\nAnd even though Abby learns that Ellie was never consulted on whether Ellie could give up her life for the cure because Abby’s father insisted that Ellie is the cure and they need to do the experimentation soon and not delay it, she still doesn’t empathise much for Ellie.\nInstead, you’re almost ‘forced’ to sympathise for Abby simply because you are now the character. Simply because you are now forced to see what she sees and forced to understand why she did what she did.\nIt’s almost this deep shit that the game developers are trying to talk about: if the story was written in Abby’s perspective from the very beginning, you would’ve been angry at Joel too. And whilst I understand wanting to give a conflicting perspective… I personally think it fell flat.\nThey’ve built up too much of Ellie & Joel in the first game and now they’re trying to squeeze an alternative perspective in the second half of TLOU2. Barely even giving the same quality of character development they did in the first game for me to even give a shit.\nIt doesn’t help that the gameplay didn’t change much either once we started playing Abby. It was still the same: scavenge, loot, create things, kill.\nAt this point I just completely dropped off of watching TLOU2 and instead decided to just read the ending for myself because man, I really cannot stand this anymore.\nAnd when I spoiled the ending for myself… it’s clear that as the player, you never got a chance to ever control Ellie’s fate or decisions and it is so nonsensically infuriating.\nAfter we finish Abby’s POV gameplay, we go back to Ellie’s POV again and Abby lets Ellie go with Tommy and Dina back to Jackson, as long as they don’t come back to Seattle.\nEllie lives with Dina on a farm a little outside of Jackson and it’s almost like as if it’s a really nice ending where they SHOULD HAVE STOPPED AT. But nope.\nEllie has PTSD from what she did in Seattle and of Joel and after having a sweet period of peaceful life with Dina, she instead insists on leaving Dina (despite Dina begging Ellie not to) to go back to hunt Abby down. CAN I INSERT ANOTHER LOUD ASS SIGH AGAIN?!\nAbby and Ellie fight and Ellie loses some fingers or something before they truly call it quits and Abby leaves Seattle for some other destination while Ellie goes back to the farm only to realise Dina is no longer there.\nAnd that’s how it all ends.\nI’m glad I didn’t waste my time watching more of the same.\nNow, TLOU2 still has amazing visuals, don’t get me wrong. There are multiple times when I would stop a video and just gawk at the set design. The way the buildings rendered, the way the light hits, sometimes even just the character design and the way each character moved was just so enchanting and life-like — it’s absolutely stunning.\nBut, it still doesn’t make me forget about the fact that TLOU2 was infuriating. I felt pissed most of the time because it felt like TLOU2 was a copy of TLOU but a different, worser plot point.\nAt least in TLOU, you didn’t feel the need to control Joel or Ellie’s character that much because it’s a very simple concept: you play as Joel, go to the Fireflies’ hospital and drop Ellie off. There’s no conflict (until the end, at least), there’s no reason for you to even make a decision for them. You just played and enjoyed the storyline as it is — a lovely father-daughter relationship blooming between Joel and Ellie as they spend time together.\nBut in TLOU2, when the plot goes up in flames at some parts of the game, I just so desperately wished we could’ve controlled their decisions. Made a difference. Change the course of the game and see something else.\nAnd maybe it’s because TLOU2 was just too similar to TLOU that it bored the heck out of me once I realised it’s going to be the same shit again.\nThere’s some speculation that because TLOU2 is named ‘Part 2’, that maybe there’s a ‘Part 3’, but for the life of me, please don’t create a Part 3. Just leave this shipwreck as it is and call it a day.\nIf you’ve watched or played TLOU2 and actually enjoyed it, let me know what you enjoyed! I would really like a different perspective on this because damn, this game was disappointing to me.\nIf you liked this post, please leave me some claps! It allows me to know if you’ve enjoyed the content and if I should continue doing more!",

            "text": "The Last of Us Part 2 review - a gut-wrenching sequel\nEmerald city blues.\nThe most common joke about the difficulty video games have reconciling their storytelling impulses with the violent action so many of them depend on revolves around the character Nathan Drake. Star of the Uncharted series, Drake is famed for his easygoing, flippant charm - yet over the course of a single game he will typically kill hundreds of people. They call him the smiling psychopath.\nThe joke must have stung the Californian Sony studio Naughty Dog, Uncharted's maker. In 2013 they started to grapple with its implications in The Last of Us, a moody post-apocalyptic thriller that upped the graphic brutality while seeking to frame it in the context of a desperate, cruel world, and also contrast it with the delicate bond developing between the protagonist, gruff smuggler Joel, and his cargo, a teen called Ellie.\nNow The Last of Us has a sequel, and in that sequel the wrestling match between the game's violent action and its thematic intentions has developed into a full-on, bareknuckle brawl. It is, perhaps for the first time in the history of big-budget action games, a fair match. It gets messy and problematic, and neither side comes out unscathed. But, by taking some big gambles, the developers land decisive blows that will send you reeling.\nThis isn't even all that The Last of Us Part 2 is attempting. This is a game about women - not about the female experience per se, but a game in which almost all the notable characters are women and in which they are not only shown exhibiting great capability and physical prowess, but also contending with dark impulses typically ascribed to men: trauma, obsession, rage and revenge. It is also a game featuring LGBTQ+ relationships and characters in a prominent but matter-of-fact way - it's not a big deal, they are just there.\nAnd it is doing all this, remember, while remaining very much a crowd-pleasing action spectacular in the Naughty Dog mould, with thrills and spills and scares, beauty and ruin and high adventure. It is a lot. Too much, really, and it is no surprise that this game gets away from its creators at times. (Yes, even the famously controlling Naughty Dog.) Not all of it works. Sometimes the tone veers into a depressing, distasteful nihilism. The characters' motivations don't always stack up. The cast is overstuffed and the subplots are often over- or undercooked. Some of its points are made with an almost laughable bluntness as it hurries on to its next big idea. At other times, it operates with rare subtlety and understatement. You will be halfway through the game before you understand what it's actually doing and more than that before you really begin to feel its dread pull. Towards the very end, it is devastating.\nIt's a very hard game to discuss without spoilers. I won't share any specifics, but if you want to go in completely cold, it might be wise to stop reading.\nThe action is set four years after the events of The Last of Us, with intermittent flashbacks that fill us in on how the characters got from there to here. Joel and Ellie have settled in the self-sufficient community of Jackson, Wyoming. The awkwardness between them after Joel's fateful actions at the end of the previous game seems to have widened into a rift. Ellie, less precocious and more defensive and spiky as a young adult, is on the verge of a relationship with a woman called Dina. In the aftermath of a snowstorm, something happens that sees Ellie and Dina set off for Seattle with revenge on their minds.\nSeattle, where we spend the majority of the game's runtime, is in bad shape. It's in total ruins, partly flooded, and initially seems deserted but for pockets of infected, the grotesque fungal zombies that have brought society down. In fact, there's a turf war raging here between two factions of survivors. The Washington Liberation Front, or Wolves, are a paramilitary organisation - a more warlike version of the first game's Fireflies - that assumed control of the city from the government after a brutal uprising. They have a darkly charismatic leader called Isaac (a cameo by the magnetic actor Jeffrey Wright), and once we learn more about them, they paint a strikingly different picture of post-outbreak survivalism than the frontiersman stylings of the Jacksonites. The Seraphites, or Scars, are less well drawn, a cut-and-paste post-apocalytpic spooky cult that is never given a plausible reason for existing.\nOn the warpath, Ellie inserts herself into this struggle and starts causing all sorts of havoc - but only after a lovely lull. When she and Dina first arrive in Seattle, the game's remorseless linear momentum is briefly broken for a pocket of open-world exploration of the ruined downtown district (an evolution of a similar episode in Uncharted: The Lost Legacy). It's a wonderfully atmospheric scene-setter. After this, we're back on Naughty Dog's beaten path for the rest of the game, although the environments are roomy and complex enough to allow for satisfying close exploration as you scavenge for supplies, as well as affording a great deal of flexibility when it comes to combat encounters.\nIt's during combat that you're most aware that you're playing a sequel from one of the world's most fastidious developers (albeit one that has seldom been known for the refinement of its gameplay mechanics). The careful iteration and professionalism of the design team are very evident. It retains The Last of Us' lean, muscular set-up, in which scarcity of ammo and supplies constantly forces you to experiment. Some of the rougher edges have been knocked off, but not so many as to eradicate its essentially scrappy nature - panicky, desperate scrapes and unintended messy bloodbaths are very much part of the vibe.\nSo is stealth, which thanks to some mechanical lifts from Uncharted 4 and the addition of a prone stance is much more viable and satisfying to play; this is now a pretty well-sorted stealth game in its own right. Like any game in which death comes quickly, it can still frustrate, but a very clever smart autosave system keeps good pace with your progress and means you'll seldom need to restart a whole encounter. (The whole game experience is unbelievably slick and seamless, even by Naughty Dog's standards.) My chief complaint is that you spend more time battling humans than infected, and they're actually the less interesting - as well as less scary - combatants to face.\nThe violence is extremely graphic, uncomfortably so. It's full of ugly flourishes, like the splattering sound of shotgun pellets ripping apart flesh, or the vicious flick that Ellie uses to slice open a neck as she performs a stealth kill. It can be sickening. Intentionally so? Surely. But I still can't help but detect a sour, grubby note of gratification to it, particularly in the repetitive context of the combat. Sometimes it breaks your connection to Ellie in a way that doesn't serve the game. Sometimes, in cutscenes, it's just taken too far, more than is needed to leave an impact or make a point.\nThis is one reason why I initially suspected The Last of Us Part 2 of being too caught up in its own grim attitude, of just being highly polished misery porn. Another is that, with its attention divided between so many ambitious gambits, with an expanding cast of characters and with most of the action taking place over a matter of days, it doesn't have the first game's gentle but constant emotional core - that delicious slow thawing between Ellie and Joel, melting into love as you journey with them over the course of a year. (Ellie and Dina's romance might have been that, but it doesn't get the necessary screen time - admittedly for good reasons.) Without that warmth, that heart, it seems a bitter world to spend time in.\nI'm happy to report that my first impressions were wrong. Unfortunately, I can't and shouldn't fully explain why. I'll limit myself to this: Druckmann and his team have a grand plan that rests on a radical structure for the game which isn't initially apparent. Once you finally understand it, it's still a slow burn, as the writers' delicate character-building - the dialogue is wonderfully understated and naturalistic - needs time to do its work. So it isn't until the game's final stretches that it gathers its true power, as you approach a point that is all the more horrifying for its total inevitability.\nIt's a huge roll of the dice from the developers, but it works, and the pay-off is almost indescribable. It would be too much to claim that you will never feel the same about video game violence again, but the shock is profound and discomfiting. It's gut-wrenching stuff. There's more to come as the game approaches an ending that is just as affecting and emotionally complex as its predecessor's, if not, perhaps, as ambiguous.\nThe thing that really struck me - and pleasantly surprised me, coming as it does from a developer so transparently in love with the language of cinema - is that The Last of Us Part 2's power is wholly unique to it being a video game. There is a special kind of empathy that develops between a player and a game protagonist that no other medium can reproduce. It's this bond that Druckmann and his team have exploited to such devastating effect. It is a sad and timely reminder of the simultaneous importance and impossibility of living someone else's experience. Play it, and listen.",

            "text": "The Last of Us Part II was a big risk. The first game arrived in 2013, during the death throes of the Playstation 3. A story of second chances, paternal love, and finding beauty amidst endless horror, it was a singular title that charted a man and girl’s journey across the broken carcass of America, in the wake of a deadly outbreak. Hugely cinematic, artfully told and emotionally resonant, it emerged as the definitive title of the PS3, and the crowning achievement of Santa Monica-based developer Naughty Dog. It was also a game with a near-perfect ending, one that sat with players and weighed upon them long after the experience was over.\nThe decision to follow on from that is something director Neil Druckmann has clearly not taken lightly. Rather than try to duplicate what worked so well in the first game’s story, he has opted to do something different, and shift the mood entirely. Where the first game was about love, Part II is a story of hate. It is a bleak, challenging, frequently upsetting, emotionally turbulent experience that asks difficult questions and offers answers that are harder still.\nFour years after the events of The Last Of Us, nineteen year-old Ellie (Ashley Johnson) and surrogate father Joel (Troy Baker) have settled back in Jackson, Wyoming, as part of the community led by Joel’s brother Tommy (Jeffrey Pierce) and his wife Maria (Ashley Scott). Life is good, punctuated by routine patrols, the occasional barn dance, camaraderie and a real sense of normalcy, despite the apocalyptic outbreak that brought wider society to ruin. Until the attack, that is. Under cover of a blizzard, hunters launch a shocking, harrowingly graphic assault that leaves the community ruptured and broken. Despite entreaties to stay, Ellie leaves Joel behind and sets out on a campaign of bloody revenge.\nWhile Joel still plays a role in the story (as both player character and companion), the perspective switch to Ellie is a significant one — far more so than in the brief segment she took centre stage in the original, or its prequel Left Behind. No longer the mouthy 14-year-old from Part I, she has since grown into a flinty, yet socially-awkward young woman. Hardened by events, she is often brittle and single-minded, but sharp edges alone do not define her. Ellie is warm and relatable, with a tenderness that surfaces often in the nervous exploration of her relationship with Dina (Shannon Woodward), who accompanies Ellie on her journey.\nAs with the first game, your companion serves a threefold purpose: lending material assistance during combat (Dina’s dead-eye marksmanship saved our hide from flanking foes on more than one occasion), offering advice on how to proceed, and, most importantly, providing character depth. As the pair spend time together, they swap stories, flirt coyly, and navigate the awkward yet intense first steps of a believable love affair. Dina is honest and forthright, sharing tales of failed relationships and memories of life before society’s collapse. Ellie deflects often with snarky humour but, as time passes, begins to lower her guard and open up. It’s a deft and delightful piece of character work, with a distinctly different feel to the spiky banter Ellie shares with Joel, and lending the unfolding story more texture and nuance than its predecessor.\nAdded complexity isn’t limited to character, either. The game’s stealth/survival gameplay has been honed and refined, a streamlined interface making inventory management less painful, while allowing frantic, mid-combat crafting to be a viable (and often necessary) strategy. The PS4 remaster of the original enhanced the visuals significantly, but the difference in fidelity between that title and this is stark nonetheless. Environments are exquisitely rendered, with an almost absurd attention to detail, from the way ferns brush Ellie’s legs as she walks through the brush, to duckweed parting before her as she swims or the simple way a bracelet slides up her wrist at the raise of an arm.\nWith most of the game taking place in Seattle, the geography has a more distinctive identity this time around. The hollowed out shell of the seaport city is overgrown and crumbling with rot: a monument of haunting emptiness. It is at once more vast but also more claustrophobic than the cross-country hike Ellie made with Joel. The clash of natural beauty and urban decay forms an environment that is by turns beguiling and deeply sinister, switching mood on a dime at the behest of a simple lighting change or shift in the rhythm of Gustavo Santaolalla’s acoustic score. As you might expect from the Pacific Northwest, the weather plays an important role, too. The sky is frequently overcast, with the patter of constant rain muffling footsteps and leaving the characters sodden and squelching.\nThe less linear environment offers multiple paths to your various destinations, lending a new sense of freedom. One section early on even takes the form of a mini open world, laying bare a section of the city, with buildings and avenues ripe for exploration or avoidance. There’s a similar sense of liberation found in playing Ellie herself. She is quick, agile and far more adept at traversing the terrain than Joel, giving gameplay a natural fluidity. Ellie can shimmy up ropes and vault over obstacles, sliding into cover; while the ability to go completely prone vastly increases the opportunity for silent kills, as you crawl through undergrowth or beneath cars to gain positional advantage. It all results in a much more flexible combat system, one that allows the seamless shift from stealth to direct action and back again multiple times within a single encounter. Thanks to an expanded crafting system that now includes stun and smoke grenades, explosive arrows and improvised, Coke-bottle silencers, there are near endless new ways to sow carnage. Melee combat in particular feels transformational, with Ellie able to dodge and counter, wreaking bloody ruin with switchblade or hatchet while engaging multiple foes at once.\nThis is among the most accomplished pieces of storytelling, across any medium, that 2020 has to offer.\nThe skill trees are similarly expanded, with new ones unlocked as the relevant survival manuals are found. Options are many and varied, offering crafting recipes, stealth enhancements and even new game mechanics, all of which feel far more desirable than the rather basic upgrades from the first game. You’ll need them, too, as enemies are not only more intelligent and adaptable but also more varied. Seattle is home to two main factions: the WLF or ‘Wolves’ and a fanatical religious cult called the Seraphites, or ‘Scars’. The Wolves are paramilitary, with hardware to spare. They deploy dogs, who are not only more observant than their handlers (not to mention more upsetting to dispatch) but can pick up your scent trail no matter how well you hide. The Scars, meanwhile, favour melee weapons and bows, whistling eerie warnings to each other and loosing arrows that cause damage over time until you can find safe refuge to dislodge the shaft. The infected ranks have swollen, too. Runners, Clickers and Bloaters return, while the first game’s canny Stalkers are utilised far more liberally, and we’re introduced to the Shambler: a hulking, bulbous figure that belches corrosive clouds.\nAltercations with each of these opponents take on a distinct flavour that will inform your tactics, and are regularly enhanced by the bombastic set pieces for which Naughty Dog has become rightly famous. Whether it’s a desperate torchlit flight through one of the city’s parks, darting between cover while pinned by a distant sniper, a blazing firefight through a residential neighbourhood, or a raging storm that’s as metaphorical as it is physical, these skilfully crafted sequences lend the game a cinematic scope and an intensity that sets the heart pounding.\nBut The Last Of Us Part II’s greatest achievement isn’t in the variety of enemies on offer or their methods of attack, but in the way they make you feel. Even run-of-the-mill foes behave with an innate humanity, bantering easily with one another, even calling out the names of fallen comrades, grief thick in their cracking voices. Unlike the anonymous foes of other titles, your enemies here are carefully and deliberately humanised, provoking a palpable sense of guilt as you cut a swathe through their ranks. Each successive death begins to weigh upon you, and as Ellie’s hands become progressively bloodier, the game forces you to confront the morality of your actions, to question her course and what she is becoming. Ultimately, to make you feel as much a monster as the mindless infected stalking the city’s derelict ruins.\nIt’s an incredibly bold move, and one that makes the game increasingly uncomfortable to play. As the story unfolds, you’re forced to face the consequences of your actions, to question tightly held truths that seemed so certain in the heat of righteous fury. It’s to make this point land that the game spares no horror in its application of violence. The unflinching brutality at play here is almost unparalleled, but none of it is gratuitous, and neither is it glamorised. As shocking as the game’s maiming, torture and mutilation unarguably is, it is intended to be so. Never to titillate, but to horrify and underscore the game’s central theme.\nNone of this would land, of course, if the writing and performances weren’t so sublime. Baker, Johnson, Woodward and other cast members including Ian Alexander (The OA) and veteran voice artist Laura Bailey, deliver incredibly nuanced, big-screen-worthy performances. These are each enhanced by state-of-the-digital-art animation and performance capture that allow the actors’ avatars to convey their most subtle facial expression just as convincingly as flesh and blood.\nThe less known about the narrative twists and turns going in, the better, but Druckmann and Westworld writer Halley Gross have crafted a singular story in The Last Of Us Part II, one that is by turns terrifying, delightful, overwhelming and traumatic. On its face this is a simple revenge tale, but one so challenging and complex, with a bold, unconventional structure, that it lays bare the myth of moral absolutes. It is a meditation on the madness of grief, on losing yourself in rage, on the depths of despair and the promise of redemption. A masterclass in audience manipulation, it smudges the line between protagonist and antagonist to teach a lesson in empathy, tribalism and the self-devouring futility of cyclical violence. All of which culminates in an ending that, much like the first game’s, will burrow into your brain like a parasite and refuse to be shaken loose.\nArriving, like its predecessor, in the twilight of a console generation, The Last Of Us Part II has managed to pull off the very same feat. But this isn’t only the defining title of the PS4, nor simply the best game of the year. This is among the most accomplished pieces of storytelling, across any medium, that 2020 has to offer — a stone-etched landmark in the history of video games. Managing the almost insurmountable task of surpassing the first game in both ambition and emotional punch, Naughty Dog has set the bar anew. A near-perfect game with emotional depth and heft few cinematic experiences can rival, The Last Of Us Part II was, it seems, a risk well worth taking.",

            "text": "The Last Of Us Part 1 Review: \"A Definitive Remake With A Hefty Price Tag\"\nDid The Last of Us need to be remade? That question doesn't have a definitive, objective answer. Any response would be totally subjective. While some games arguably deserve a remake or remaster more than others, regardless, it all comes down to what the audience wants. The Last of Us is one of the most popular and successful games of the last decade, and it certainly isn't the only game in that time to receive costly rereleases across multiple generations of consoles. The Last of Us Part 1 is here, bringing the PlayStation 3 classic up to PS5 standards, so let's take a look at it.\nSame Streets, Different Faces\nIt's hard to know where to start when reviewing a remake of one of the most popular games of all time. Chances are high that you have already played it, and are only here to read about what has changed. While it is certainly accurate to call this a remake, for reasons we will get into, this feels more like a remaster. That is to say, TLOU Part 1 is the same game again in many ways. It feels the same, it looks the same. This is not a fundamental remake like Resident Evil 2 or Final Fantasy VII. At face value, the changes here seem pretty minimal. This is not an all-new way to experience a game that desperately needed an overhaul, this is the game you played in 2013 with a facelift and some quality improvements elsewhere.\nMuch of the game is exactly as it was because there was no need to alter it. All dialogue, voice lines, characters and scenarios are present and accounted for. Nothing has been shifted around, this isn't a director's cut where the flow or pace of the game has been changed. Any deviation from the original version of the game is minimal, almost purely cosmetic. While there are aspects of the sequel's DNA that have found their way into this remake, new gameplay features like the ability to go prone or dodge have not been added to this game. This remake is very clearly intended as a replacement for the original, the new intended experience for the original story. Much like with the PS4 remaster in 2014, we are to disregard earlier versions for this one.\nLike The Ship of Theseus\nSo far, this sounds like little more than a coat of paint. Beyond the obvious visual difference, there is more to The Last of Us Part 1. As said, this is a remake and it very much is a game remade. While locations are the same, almost every aspect of most of them has been rebuilt. New assets, new lighting, new sound effects. Character models are brand new. For the main cast, this is a massive change that warrants the remake treatment. It is only when seen side by side that you come to realise how much we have moved passed the technology of 2013. What was then cutting edge is now quite outdated, and the new facial models look far more like natural, realistic human faces.\nBeyond the visual overhaul, there have been improvements made to the AI. When it was released, the original The Last of Us had one major sticking point, and that was the AI of the non-player characters. For a game that made big claims about having advanced enemy AI that would try to out-think and out-flank the player, that really wasn't the case in the original game. In fact, the enemy AI turned out quite inept, often spending much of the game's combat scenarios running back and forth like chickens sans heads.\nThankfully, this has been massively improved. Even with several years since I played the original version, I noticed the improvements to enemy behaviour pretty quickly. I found myself in situations where I assumed the enemies wouldn't cope based on previous experience, and was surprised when they did. That said, there are times when it feels like perhaps they overcorrected, as enemies can be a little too aggressive sometimes, but overall the enemy AI is a drastic improvement. Companion AI is a little less impressive. Ellie still occasionally runs out in front of guards during stealth sequences. Still, at least you don't get caught for that. A bit of immersion lost, but no real harm done.\nA Lot Of Work, And A Lot Of Money\nA regressive statement would be to say that this is TLOU remade in TLOU2's engine. This is a rhetoric that has done the rounds, and while there is obviously some truth to it, it really is not a fair statement. In many ways, The Last of Us Part 1 is a much more graphically advanced game than the sequel. Bear in mind, TLOU2 was a PS4 game, and we are on to a new generation of hardware which is what this remake was built for. In other ways, the sequel is still the more advanced game.\nTLOU2 iterated and improved on much of the gameplay and level design elements of the first game. Many of those improvements are not present in the remake, it is simply too faithful a remake for any of that. As amazing as it looks, at its core this is still a game from 2013. The dialogue can be a tad clunky. AI companions often act strangely. You still walk into a room and find it conspicuously filled with waist-high walls and crates. There are, however, a lot of improvements in the remake that bring it in step with the sequel, in a way which makes them a more complete pair. This is not simply an old game slapped into a new engine and called a day, this took some serious work.\nWas all that work worth it? We know that games like The Last of Us are extremely expensive to make and require the staff at Naughty Dog to work very hard. Too hard, even, as conditions at the studio are reportedly very intense. Developers were forced to crunch hard, working far too many hours and far too many days on each of The Last of Us games. This game is a remake, and while that might not have meant as much work for the writers or the directors, it was undoubtedly a full game's worth of development work for artists, programmers, and everyone who works on the tech side of Naughty Dog. Some people were likely overworked just so The Last of Us could get the PS5 coat of varnish.\nSo who benefits from this remake? Sony for the most part. Contrary to many other remakes and remasters, The Last of Us Part 1 costs the full price of a newly released Sony exclusive. That is to say, £69.99/$69.99/€79.99 on the PS5 digital store. That is the same price that God of War Ragnarok is currently available to pre-order for. Often times when a game is remastered or even remade, it launches below triple-A prices, because who wants to pay full price for a remake of something they already own? For all intents and purposes, the remakes of Resident Evil 2 and 3 are brand new games, and even those games launched at a price lower than what you would expect to pay for a brand new Resident Evil game.\nA Question Of Value\nThis isn't the first time Sony has done this, as the Demon's Souls remake that launched with the PS5 was also quite expensive. However, that was a much more extensive remake of a game that had not been available since the PS3. Sony presents many of its original titles as more premium products than most games, and this seems to be another instance of that. Still, it feels a bit galling to pay out for this TLOU remake that doesn't reinvent the original game like the Resident Evil or Final Fantasy VII remakes did, and pay more money than you would for just about any other new release. The remake isn't any cheaper if you own the previous version or The Last of Us Part 2, and it isn't included in or discounted for being part of any tier of the new PlayStation Plus subscriptions. Even if you are paying up to £100 a year for a Game Pass-like subscription, Sony still expects you to hand out full price for The Last of Us Part 1.\nAny way you shake it, you are paying more than you would for a brand new game to play a remake of a game that is less than ten years old, and arguably did not need to be remade. Is The Last of Us Part 1 the best way to play one of the most critically acclaimed games of all time? Undoubtedly. Does that warrant a higher price tag than the original game had? Debatable. It is clear that Naughty Dog and Sony see this as the new definitive way to experience The Last of Us, but evidently, they do not think that experience is for everyone.\nThe only people I can wholeheartedly recommend this version of the game to are those who have never played it before, and then I would still be apprehensive about the price tag. With the world going from one economic crisis to the next and people worrying about paying their bills, this overly expensive, third release of a nine-year-old game feels a little bit like Sony looking at hungry masses and saying let them eat cake. Wait for a sale.\n8/10\nReviewed on PlayStation 5. Code provided by publisher.",

            "text": "The Last of Us Part I's PS5 version was reviewed by Jake Dekker, while its PC port was reviewed by Alessandro Barbosa.\nJoel looks different in The Last of Us Part I. It took me a while to notice, but once I did, it was hard to unsee. There's a pain in his eyes. His clothes and features are the same, but there's a quiet, unmistakable torment imprinted on his face. I've played The Last of Us nearly a dozen times across PS3 and PS4, and I had never seen it worn so plainly. I know Joel has a troubled past because The Last of Us Part I goes out of its way to show you a traumatic death in the opening scene, but that pain was never etched into his facial features this clearly.\nThere's an argument to be made that The Last of Us Part I is too similar to the PS3 and PS4 versions to be considered a remake, and part of me agrees with that sentiment. The story is identical, the level design is exactly the same, and the gameplay--apart from some quality-of-life improvements--is unchanged. On paper, if you've played The Last of Us and remember it well, there's little reason to return to it on PS5.\nBut The Last of Us Part I is more than the sum of its parts. It's an unrelenting tour de force that strategically leverages the power of the PlayStation 5 to push its story and themes a little further. Slight though many of them may be, all its enhancements serve the story, and the story is just as good as it was nine years ago.\nThe most obvious way The Last of Us Part I does this is with its visuals. The overhauled lighting, sharp new textures, and smoother animations make The Last of Us a prettier game, but it's the details in the faces and characters that make it a more meaningful one. I can feel the repressed pain in Joel, sense the pervasive hope in Marlene, and glimpse fleeting moments of innocence in Ellie.\nThese details may not alter the way you think about these characters, but they certainly add more depth to them. Admittedly, these are also details that I've internalized through my multiple playthroughs, years of thinking about the game, and hours of consuming analysis of it. But the intricacies in the way characters are now depicted mean that, for newcomers in particular, the nuances are more immediately perceptible. The writing and acting remain as strong as ever, and although none of the changes recontextualize characters or events, delicate retouches give them greater gravitas.\nWhat does recontextualize the characters is the existence of The Last of Us Part II. Joel's actions are harder to stomach knowing their eventual consequences, and Ellie's bloody quest for revenge in the sequel makes her character arc in Part I all the more tragic. Even if you didn't like the direction the narrative took in Part II, it makes the final moments of The Last of Us Part I tougher to swallow.\nWhat's more interesting is that, despite knowing how things would eventually shake out, I rarely questioned Joel's motives throughout the game, even in those final moments. It's a testament to Naughty Dog's superb storytelling and fantastic characters that--despite knowing full well what Joel's actions entailed--I wanted to protect Ellie at all costs. All those complicated feelings The Last of Us left me with nine years ago came back stronger when I wrapped up Part I.\nThe gameplay improvements, although subtle, are also done in service of the story. Aiming is more responsive, weapons have a satisfying heft to them, and Joel is a bit easier to maneuver. He's not as nimble as Ellie is in Part II, but a lot of the rough edges in the original have been smoothed out. This kind of stuff is to be expected in remaster or remake, but in the case of The Last of Us Part I, it removes another barrier from the experience. The tweaks to the combat and gameplay give Joel a more cohesive characterization on screen. It may seem like reading a bit too much into it but think of the times you've clumsily missed your gunshots because of the way the aiming works and how that undermined a character we're told has been fighting to survive in a hellish post-apocalypse for 20 years--he shouldn't be whiffing shots in matters of life and death. With the tweaks, The Last of Us Part I's Joel feels more like a cold and calculated combatant. He is as ruthless as you'd expect from someone in his position and with his tragic history.\nThe improved AI, meanwhile, brings with it a greater sense of peril, especially on the tougher difficulties. Enemies are more aggressive and employ advanced tactics. Some will pressure you from afar while others will flank you if you aren't paying attention. Every now and then an enemy will wait for you to approach and go for an ambush. The unpredictable AI makes for some harrowing firefights. Success demands a mixture of forethought, improvisation, and skill.\nWhat really makes the AI so effective is its tenacity. Enemies will fight tooth and nail to survive. If you take an enemy hostage, they will try to bargain with you. Others in the vicinity will try to talk you down before taking action. If you hold a hostage for too long, they will struggle free and return fire. The enemies you come across don't just feel like an obstacle you have to overcome. They feel like people desperately trying to survive in a world that has been torn apart.\nIt helps that companion AI is much better, too. In the original, Ellie, Tess, and Bill would frequently end up in places they shouldn't have been. They couldn't alert enemies, but it was always jarring to see Ellie run in front of an infected while looking for cover. Occasionally in Part I, a companion did get in my way in some tighter areas, but I haven't seen anyone carelessly wander into the fray in this new version. It's a small fix but, once again, it makes this world feel more authentic.\nWhere The Last of Us Part I shows its age is in its level design. Just like the original nine years ago, the game often relies on pallets, dumpsters, and ladders for its traversal puzzles. The Last of Us Part I takes place over the course of a year, and Joel never takes the time to teach Ellie to swim. This means that every time you encounter deep water you need to find a conveniently placed pallet to ferry her across a small body of water. It was hard to overlook back then, but it's even harder to overlook now. Naughty Dog has gone through great pains to immerse the player in the world, and these simple puzzles don't fit the tone of the game. They are rote video game moments in an experience that doesn’t need them.\nThe Last of Us Part I is an unrelenting tour de force that strategically leverages the power of the PlayStation 5 to push its story and themes a little further. Slight though many of them may be, all its enhancements serve the story, and the story is just as good as it was nine years ago\nThe combat arenas also feel a bit too enclosed and straightforward. There are some standouts, like the docks at the beginning of the game or the bookstore in Philadelphia, but most of the encounters take place in linear corridors with waist-high objects used as cover. This lack of freedom limits your options in combat and makes it difficult to improvise when your back is up against a wall. It's a shame because Joel's arsenal is varied, and his craftable items can be fun to use.\nIt's even harder to overlook given how impressive Part II's level design was. The reason why combat felt so dynamic in Part II was because there was always room to improvise and multiple avenues of approach to support this. This is unmistakably one of those moments where the limited scope of this \"remake\" undermines the idea of creating harmony between the first and second parts of The Last of Us' overall story. While the narrative and characterization certainly feel more cohesive now, the same can't be said for how it feels to play the two games.\nThe biggest example of this is Joel's inability to go prone. It may have seemed like a minor mechanic in The Last of Us Part II, but it fundamentally changed the way I approached combat. Obviously, Part I was not designed with a crawling Joel in mind. There is no grass to hide in, and cover is almost always waist-high, but the inability to go prone does create more of a dissonance between Part I and Part II.\nHowever, fixating on gameplay discrepancies between both games diminishes The Last of Us Part I's achievements. The brilliantly-paced narrative is supported by some of the finest environmental storytelling in the business. So much of the world and its inhabitants can be extracted from the smallest details. A throwaway line between two hostile enemy NPCs can shed light on other parts of the world, while a simple message scrawled across a wall hints at how the outbreak was handled two decades ago. The environments are rich with details that add flavor to Joel and Ellie's journey.\nThe most welcome addition to The Last of Us Part I is its impressive suite of accessibility features. Like The Last of Us Part II, there are a wide range of visual, auditory, and difficulty settings that significantly lower the bar to entry and make the experience more accommodating. You can customize subtitles, tweak screenshake, enable different vision modes, and retool the controls at any time to fit your needs. Even if you don't think you need any of these features, you might find something in there to make your experience a little smoother. I frequently played with high-contrast mode enabled to help me track down smaller collectibles that I wouldn't normally be able to see, but for others, these newly added options might make what was previously an unplayable game into a playable one.\nAdditionally, The Last of Us Part I adds a ton of new unlockables in the Extras menu. Like in previous Naughty Dog games, as you play through the story you accrue points that can be used to unlock all sorts of things. There's concept art from both the original and remake, new and returning character skins, gameplay modifiers like infinite ammo and explosive arrows, and a handful of behind-the-scenes videos and podcasts. While none of this fundamentally changes the experience, I spent hours digging through this menu to admire all the intricately designed character models and test out the new gameplay modifiers. These bells and whistles do a good job of rounding out the package.\nThe most painful omission from this remake is Factions, the stellar PvP mode from the original game. The multiplayer mode had players choose a faction and build out a camp of survivors by running Supply Raids, which were matches that pitted you against the rival faction. Success would earn you resources to keep your compound afloat. Naughty Dog is working on an expanded standalone multiplayer component set in the world of The Last of Us and its sequel, but it's a shame the original Factions mode didn't make the cut.\nThose looking for a little longevity from the game can instead try the speedrun and permadeath modes. The permadeath mode in particular fits nicely with the themes of The Last of Us. It's not for the faint of heart, even on easier difficulties, but it significantly ups the stakes. Every encounter must be tackled with precision, and a wasted bullet could lead to an untimely death. The speedrun mode on the other hand feels at odds with what The Last of Us accomplishes with its story. The thoughtful pace and quiet moments are undone by a timer and a scoring system. It's not necessarily a bad inclusion, and it's available as an option, but it's definitely not the way I'd like to experience The Last of Us Part I.\nAll these improvements taken by themselves may seem minor, but together they make one of the most memorable games of the PS3 era even better. In some ways, the two parts of The Last of Us are now better aligned, making transitioning between them much smoother. However, in other ways, the years of progress in game design and development are all too apparent. But while some of the level design may not have aged all that well, the vivid cast of characters and remarkable story are more poignant than ever.\nThe Last of Us Part I For PC\nHot off the heels of the successful The Last of Us on HBO, the long-awaited port of the first game in Naughty Dog's acclaimed series has arrived on PC with disappointing results. Those who have waited over a decade since the game's original release on PS3, or anyone looking to replay the first chapter in Joel and Ellie's tale again on PC, will be let down by the game's overall performance, which manages to shine only on the most expensive and least used hardware on the market today.\nThere are two fundamental issues that plague The Last of Us Part I on PC. First is VRAM (video memory found on your GPU) usage, and more specifically how much the game demands. Running at 1440p with Ultra settings, the game's expansive settings menu informed me that the 12GB of VRAM on my RTX 3080 Ti would not be enough, suggesting I drop settings like texture quality and filtering down to compensate. Ignoring the advice led to some consistent stuttering during gameplay, which, for a change, isn't down to shader compilation stutter. After first opening the game, you're subjected to a 45-minute-long shader compilation (which you'll have to do again after a graphics driver update or reinstallation), negatively impacting performance if you decide to play while this happens. But once that's complete, it meant that any stutters I did encounter were exclusively due to settings pushing past the recommended VRAM limits.\nThat means, for a relatively powerful GPU like the RTX 3080 Ti, Ultra settings even at 1440p were off the table, which doesn't bode well for cards lower down the chain. The RTX 3070, a popular choice amongst PC gamers, only comes with 8GB of VRAM, which prevents you from playing The Last of Us Part I with anything higher than Medium texture settings, irrespective of resolution. I verified this using an RTX 3050 with 8 GB of VRAM, which doesn't perform equally to the RTX 3070 but has the exact same memory limitations. What's problematic about that is just how drastically different the game looks at these settings, with texture resolution and clarity taking a significant hit between High and Medium presets. It's so degraded that it's at a point where you're playing a far less visually impressive game when compared to its PlayStation 5 version, despite having more capable hardware.\nThe second issue is CPU performance. The Last of Us Part I makes surprisingly great use of all the cores of your CPU, which isn't the norm in a sea of titles that are still so reliant on powerful single cores. What is baffling, and detrimental to performance, is just how much the game is using your CPU all the time, and how hard it is frequently each core in the least demanding scenarios. Near the opening hour of the game, I was standing in an empty alleyway with only two other NPCs in sight and zero interactions taking place. At this moment, The Last of Us Part I was hammering all 12 threads of my AMD Ryzen 5600X, with each one reporting over 80% usage. While moving around and engaging in combat, each thread was routinely hovering around 90-95% usage, touching 100% from time to time and limiting my overall frame rate as a result. Marvel's Spider-Man on PC is another CPU-heavy game, but in that situation it makes more sense, as you're moving fast through a large open world with loads more happening as you zip past traffic and pedestrians. And even then, I never saw CPU usage at half of what The Last of Us Part I was demanding during my time with Spider-Man. The Last of Us Part I's CPU usage is currently out of control, and you'll probably find yourself CPU-limited in numerous scenarios even if you have the latest GPU to push past its other issues.\nIt's a shame that playing The Last of Us Part I right now on anything but a GPU with at least (and preferably more than) 12GB of VRAM is a severely limited experience--especially when compared to its stellar performance on Sony's own hardware--because this remake routinely establishes itself as one of the most visually captivating ports of a Sony title yet on PC. It's difficult to reconcile that this was once a game on two-generations-old console hardware, but if you have the graphical horsepower to show it off at its best, it's a marvel of gorgeous lighting, highly-detailed environments, and stunnings character modeling that is accentuated with additional PC settings that show the game off in a new, stunning light.\nThe settings menu itself is extensive, with helpful previews that show how your changes are affecting the image and useful descriptions informing you of what parts of your PC you're helping by turning things down. The VRAM usage meter is helpful in reigning in settings that would otherwise cause irritating stutter, but it's also the facet of this menu that's most confusing. It features a section that suggests a portion of your VRAM is being locked up by other applications and your operating system, but the figure it reports doesn't correlate to actual usage. Even more confusing is that this figure scales according to how much VRAM you have in total, with 2.4GB being used on my 12GB RTX 3080 Ti and 1.5GB on my RTX 3050. There is no real way to bring it down, either, which may (or may not) be affecting overall VRAM usage by the game itself.\nThis is something that should hopefully be addressed by future patches, along with a host of other performance improvements and optimizations to bring this port to a level of quality we've come to expect from Naughty Dog. It's disappointing after the relatively good work done on the Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection that The Last of Us Part I seems a long way away from being a smooth experience for most players. So if you've been waiting all these years to finally experience Joel and Ellie's story for the first time, it's probably best if you wait at least a little longer.",

News Reviews Tips Esports Twitter twitter Instagram instagram Youtube YouTube Twitch twitch The Washington Post Democracy Dies in Darkness HBO’s ‘The Last of Us’ stays true to the game, and hits just as hard Review by      Gene Park Updated     January 10, 2023 at 6:09 p.m. EST | Published     January 10, 2023 at 3:01 a.m. EST (Washington Post illustration; HBO) Listen 7 min Comment on this story Comment Gift     Article Share HBO’s “The Last of Us” places a lot of faith in its source material’s writing. The TV adaptation doesn’t veer far from the script set by the video game. That confidence is not misplaced. The 2013 PlayStation 3 title, Naughty Dog’s “The Last of Us,” broke ground as a video game that looked more like a prestige TV show or film than just about any other game before it. Players took on the roles of Joel, a long-grieving father turned black market smuggler who suffered immeasurable tragedy at the start of a zombie outbreak, and 14-year-old Ellie, an orphan who has only ever known the post-apocalypse — a militarized and zombie-ridden America. This Sunday — nearly a decade after the first game’s release — old PlayStation fans and new viewers alike will see fresh faces in those roles: Pedro Pascal as Joel and Bella Ramsey playing Ellie. Tech is not your friend. We are. Sign up for The Tech Friend newsletter. ArrowRight The zombies in “The Last of Us” aren’t the undead. Instead, they are humans infected by a souped-up version of the real-life Cordyceps fungus, which takes over the brain functions of creatures, mostly insects. In “The Last of Us,” humans are susceptible to this fungal infection and become manic, ravenous monsters. And unlike a viral pandemic, there is no vaccine. HBO’s take on the video game property finally answers the question: What if a big-budget TV or film adaptation stayed faithful to the source material, even repeating the same scenes, lines and big story beats? Because that’s exactly what the show does. There are scenes throughout the first season that are direct line reads of key scenes from the game. The nine episodes follow the exact same story beats and almost the same locations as the original game too. People who know the game by heart will likely be able to recite some lines right as they’re being spoken in the show. I’ve played the game dozens of times over the years. Watching the show, I felt like some old stage actor, seeing others reading lines I knew by heart, repeating actions just as I had performed them in 2013 and many times since. Because “The Last of Us” was already structured and written like a TV show, HBO’s rendition is primed to work — and it does. It treats most of the key scenes well, with doting respect. In some ways, the story is better for it, thanks to more granular insight into the lives of certain characters. For example, the brothers Sam and Henry — already pivotal characters from the game — are given a far more extensive story that explains their plight and their reasons for wanting to join Joel and Ellie. They feel less like characters in a “side quest” in a game, especially since their relationship now draws stronger, clearer parallels between them and Joel and his older brother. Advertisement The most common complaint video game enthusiasts have about TV or film adaptations is that they rarely stay true to the source material. Just ask any fan of Resident Evil who had to sit through Milla Jovovich kung-fu kicking her way through six films that barely referenced the original game. More recently, Paramount’s “Halo” show in 2022  drew relentless backlash  from the game’s community over how it rewrote characters to have completely different motivations and personalities. HBO’s “The Last of Us,” adapted by showrunner Craig Mazin (of “Chernobyl” fame) and Naughty Dog’s co-president, Neil Druckmann, will likely not draw the same ire. Instead, the show offers exactly what fans have loudly demanded: an adaptation that feels faithful to the source material in look, sound and vibes. It works because The Last of Us series had already won over a wide audience of players, and remains among the  most highly decorated video game franchises ever made. You don’t need to play ‘The Last of Us’ to watch the HBO show Like the game, Mazin and Druckmann’s reworked TV version is not an ensemble story; this is no “The Walking Dead.” Instead, it is laser-focused on the budding relationship between two people who want nothing to do with each other. “The Last of Us” is more of a buddy road trip show than yet another show about a zombie apocalypse. The monsters are barely the focus. And like in the game, it portrays this all with earnestness and not an ounce of irony. Despite being faithful in many key moments, there are some notable changes and additions to the characters. The show, it seems, wants to be less cynical than the game. One early episode, where two characters are completely reworked in plot, characterization, motivation and rapport, is the entire season’s highlight. In the game, these characters’ stories ended with tragedy, bitterness and anger. The show, however, treats these two with far more dignity and grace. That story is of a kind that could not have been told in the game. The game’s true magic lay in allowing players to embody Joel and Ellie. This meant the perspective of the story could never leave their eyes, lest we lose control as the audience. But in the show, the camera and the writing are finally liberated from the two leads, allowing new side stories to flourish, enriching our understanding of the world and its characters. For those familiar with the game, “enchanting and romantic” are two words you might not associate with this story. But HBO’s revision manages to tell a loving story in a loveless, lifeless world. Advertisement Pascal and Ramsey also have a chemistry that  just works . As someone familiar with the original game performances by Troy Baker and Ashley Johnson, I still saw the HBO portrayals as true to the characters of Joel and Ellie. The game focused on their journey’s most portentous scenes, but the show allows peeks into quieter, less busy moments. Again, there is more kindness here than the game could have allowed. Joel and Ellie, less hurried by the mandates of driving an action video game, are allowed to talk more, and on occasion, smile and laugh. \"The Last of Us\" creators explain Ellie's arc: From wide-eyed girl to a woman fueled by vengeance When the show lurches toward its most pivotal scenes, Pascal and Ramsey are at their best. The heartbreaking first 15 minutes of the game are depicted here, and Pascal’s performance underscores the blooming heartache that would fester into a shriveled, diminished soul. I knew what was going to happen, it happened, yet I still felt compelled to shed a tear. And Ramsey’s “Game of Thrones” experience was great practice for portraying Ellie as a young girl born into a world that doesn’t nurture innocence. Ellie’s reluctant guardian is a broken man — and an ill portent for her future. The entire season covers the plot of the first game. The show doesn’t feel hurried; each episode lasts about an hour long. Many of the episodic emotional cliffhangers from the first game are, again, echoed in the show. Now, a new generation of TV watchers will engage with the debate that players of the game have litigated over and over for the past decade around character decisions and what it means to do the right thing in a shattered world. Advertisement There is a nagging sense that some minor changes to dialogue were made just for the sake of change, and it’s hard for me, as someone who’s digested the game thoroughly for years, to parse whether they work better. In my initial judgment, they seem like lateral changes, not worse, not necessarily better. Viewers in the know will notice, and like me, may wonder why these changes were made when the original lines conveyed the same information and emotions. But as someone who admires the original game and what it achieved, HBO’s “The Last of Us” is still a fascinating and enjoyable ride through an old familiar adventure tale, powered by actors who honor the original vision. When I compare the two stories, and the artistic choices made to differentiate the show from the game, I have to admit: The HBO version sometimes steals the show. “The Last of Us” premieres on HBO and HBO Max on Sunday, Jan. 15, at 9 p.m. Eastern. correction A previous version of this article misspelled the surname of the actress who plays Ellie. She is Bella Ramsey. This article has been corrected.  Comments GiftOutline Gift Article View more Loading...

            "text": "The Last of Us | Episode 2 review: The Infected\nThe wait is finally over. Join us every week as we dissect every episode of the long-awaited adaptation of The Last of Us, starring Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsey.\nIn episode 2, Joel, Tess and Ellie continue their journey and face off against the deadly Clickers.\nSpoiler alert: These reviews will include spoilers for each episode, so if you’d rather go in cold, we recommend you return to this review after watching the latest episode.\nEpisode 2 of The Last of Us begins in Indonesia and chronicles the very beginning of the pandemic that would bring humanity to their knees. The similarities to COVID-19 are terrifying, but maybe that’s exactly why now is the time to bring The Last of Us to the small screen.\nWe are introduced to a scientist specialising in fungi, who quickly realises what’s happening with the cordyceps, which has infected and transformed its first victims is no joke. Even scarier is that the police are unable to tell who was the first person infected or what infected them. Genuine chills.\nWe then come back to 2023 and join Tess, Joel and Ellie as they’re trekking towards the Massachusetts State House. If you, like me, are a bit impatient and keen on seeing more infected, you may be itching for it by now. We’ve seen very little of the infected, especially up close. Where has all that HBO money gone?\nFear not. There will be plenty of action later on, but for now, it’s baby steps. The Last of Us is purposely a little light on the zombie action; the focus has been shifted to humans, mostly to show how we, as a species, are coping with the shitshow that has become Earth.\nThe second episode, titled ‘Infected’ does give us a lot more action involving the infected. Relatively early on in the episode, our group runs into the infected, including a Clicker. Gamers will shudder just at the sound of those buggers; they are the worst kind of infected you deal with in the game. Deadly, but notoriously difficult to defeat or sneak around, these bastards are truly nasty.\nThe entire sequence in which the gang hides from the infected is tense and riveting. The Last of Us steers very close to the source material and in all honesty, some of the scenes which would be stealth missions in the game, suffers slightly from the passiveness that comes with a TV show.\nTess, Joel and Ellie finally make it out alive and continue their journey. Tess is in a sudden hurry and when they reach the State House, we finally find out why. The Fireflies are long gone from there and Tess completely loses it.\nTurns out, she got bit earlier by one of the infected and now only has mere hours before she, too, will become a flesh-hungry monster. It’s a nasty fate and showrunners Craig Mazin and Neil Druckmann have established it’s something to be avoided at all costs. These people would rather die than turn into one of these things.\nWhile she initially held some hope that bringing Ellie to the Fireflies in time might help her, Tess has no choice but to admit that this is the end of the road for her. Even if Ellie, immune to the cordyceps infection, holds the key to the cure, it’s too late for Tess. She tearfully forces Joel to take Ellie and continue their journey, go see Bill and Frank for supplies and then find Tommy in Wyoming, perhaps he knows where the Fireflies now are.\nAs the infected loom closer, she stays behind, being devoured by the infected as a horde of them break through the doors into the building. The tendrils, once again seen in close-up, are truly grim. They squirm and move and the idea of those burrowing into you is horrifying. The Last of Us is becoming a very visceral experience and we’re fully digging it so far.\nEpisode 2 is where Mazin and Druckmann are beginning to change things up ever so slightly. Here, Tess is killed by the infected rather than soldiers like in the original game and we believe episode 3 will bring the biggest changes of all. So far, The Last of Us is an early contender for the best TV of 2023, but a lot can still change.",

            "text": "GameCentral’s spoiler free review of Naughty Dog’s latest PS4 exclusive is a darkly disturbing journey of vengeance and redemption.\nIt’s unfortunate that the most common topic of discussion when it comes to The Last Of Us Part 2, at least before its release, is spoilers. That’s not surprising, considering the game was subject to one of the most extensive leaks in modern gaming history (there are no spoilers in that link) but we guarantee that once the game is out, and everyone has had a chance to play it, the conversation is going to move onto much more interesting subjects.\nFor this review we’re, ironically, under much more severe restrictions than usual, as to what we can talk about in terms of the story before launch. Ordinarily we might resent that fact but if you don’t already know what happens in the game then that’s probably because you’ve been purposefully avoiding finding out, and we certainly don’t want to be the ones to spoil it for you.\nThat does make explaining even the basics of the plot difficult though, so we’ll just use the official description from Sony themselves: ‘Ellie pursues vengeance after a traumatic event’. In the game’s world it’s been 25 years since a zombie-like plague destroyed modern civilisation and only now are semblances of organised society beginning to reappear. But The Last Of Us isn’t about plot, it’s about characters, and the question of who Ellie is and what her motivations are is far more important than any background lore.\nOf course, if you’ve played the first game you’ll know exactly who Ellie is: the only person known to be immune to the ‘infected’, which in the first game made her of vital interest to an ostensibly benign militia group called the Fireflies. Suffice to say though, that things did not go to plan for them and the infected plague was not cured. As such, the sequel starts five years later, when Ellie and her surrogate father Joel are living as part of a particularly well-equipped community in Wyoming.\nAs developer Naughty Dog threatened when the game was first announced, the primary themes here are hate and the cycle of violence. And while that doesn’t manifest in quite the way you might be imagining it certainly does illustrate how Ellie’s love for Joel, and new girlfriend Dina, is perverted into a wholly destructive force, that turns her from the spunky teenager of the original game into a hate-filled monster with zero empathy for anyone but her small circle of friends.\nSome fans already seem to have taken this as a betrayal of the character, but the game illustrates very well not just how her change in attitude happened but how it was almost inevitable given how poor a father figure Joel is. The Last Of Us Part 2 is a story about selfish, insensate people doing terrible things, but the motivations of everyone is not only clear but relatively understandable.\nAs in any Naughty Dog game, the dialogue and voice-acting is superb, but what’s most interesting is the way the game humanises your opponents and how your sympathies gradually shift from Ellie to her victims. The game enables you to spend significant amounts of time with Ellie’s prime targets, allowing you to get to know and understand them; at least enough to see them as real people rather than just objectives or end of level bosses.\nEllie sees none of this though and kills without hesitation or mercy. But you, as the player, understand who these people are and why they did what they did. More than once you, as Ellie, are forced to kill someone you know does not deserve it and those moments are extremely disturbing, as if you’re being coerced into a crime you want no part of. Not since Kratos in the original God Of War trilogy have we disliked a player character so much and given the considerably more realistic tone of The Last Of Us, Ellie’s descent is far more harrowing.\nIt’s all the more so because Ellie is so hypocritical about the whole situation, regularly admonishing others for their violence and immorality. This is particularly true of a new militia group she comes into conflict with, as she at one point describes them as ‘not like us’ – implying that Ellie and her group have a moral superiority that she certainly never demonstrates.\nThe Last Of Us Part 2 has some of the best storytelling video games have ever seen, not simply for the quality of its presentation but the fact that it has something important to say. If you’ve ever watched a movie, or played a game, and cheered on the murder of faceless cannon fodder, Ellie’s actions will make you think twice about doing so again.\nThis is a game about empathy, from both sides of the TV screen; Ellie’s lack of it and your growing frustration with her and the lives she is destroying without ever even trying to understand. The game also neatly sidesteps one of the great limitations of storytelling in an action game, by answering the question of how you can have an anti-violence narrative and at the same time gameplay that makes killing fun. Although having a protagonist that is clearly in the wrong, and who you resent more and more the further you get, is obviously not a solution for every game.\nAnd yet the experience can be frustrating for those that expect to have as much control over the story as the action, even though that’s never been Naughty Dog’s style. There are no dialogue options, no branching narratives, and no opportunity to say no. The story has to play out the way Naughty Dog say and you have no more control over it than if it was a movie, which at certain points – especially some self-indulgently long flashback sequences – it almost seems as if it should have been.\nWhen you’re forced to carry out Ellie’s actions in a pivotal encounter, by pressing the attack button, you’re learning a little about your own morality, but mostly you’re just acting as a puppet for the game’s director. Except when the game takes over completely in a cut scene and any illusion that the story is being told through you, rather than at you, evaporates. That’s an issue the ending of the first game shared and yet, once again, the narrative is strong enough that the lack of interactivity doesn’t leave you feeling as detached from events as it might have.\nBut while Naughty Dog’s storytelling is a stylistic choice there are still flaws in the execution, the most serious being the fact that the game is simply too long. It’s twice that of the original, and while there is a good reason for that there’s still a similar flabbiness about the mid-section, with a lot of what amounts to filler in terms of both story and combat encounters.\nYou’ll notice we haven’t mentioned the gameplay yet and that’s for the simple reason that it’s nowhere near as interesting, or innovative, as the narrative. It’s still perfectly entertaining but at this point the simplistic stealth mechanics feel very overfamiliar and bordering on old-fashioned.\nThere are a dozen or more other stealth games, from Metal Gear to Batman: Arkham, that offer both deeper stealth mechanics and a considerably greater range of other gameplay elements. All there is to The Last Of Us Part 2 is stealth and equally simplistic combat (melee fighting is just one punch and a dodge).\nThere’s also some light platforming and the occasional puzzle, but the majority of the latter involves either throwing ropes or moving giant wheelie bins and although a few are quite interesting in their use of physics they become increasingly rare as the story goes on.\nNone of this should suggest that The Last Of Us Part 2 is in anyway bad in terms of its gameplay, as apart from the finicky item and weapon selection the combat is just as polished as the rest of the game, but the difference in ambition and complexity between the storytelling and gameplay is significant.\nDespite being a much bigger focus, the stealth is barely any more complex than Uncharted 4 and you can’t even do basic things like move dead bodies. And while there is a range of unlockable skills and craftable traps and throwables they’re rarely necessary on the default difficulty.\nIf The Last Of Us was just a straight action game with a generic story then it would be quickly dismissed as shallow and repetitive. Although it would still be lauded for its astonishingly good graphics. The facial animation is the best console games have ever seen and so too is the foliage, both of which we’re sure will not be equalled by most next gen games at launch. Although the most enticing preview of what the PlayStation 5 may bring is the ultra-quick load times when you die, which are hugely appreciated.\nThe transition between animations can be a bit clumsy at times, and we encountered a few seconds of slowdown here and there, but the only real technical failing is the amount of noise the game causes the console’s fans to produce. The use of music is excellent but large sections of the game are supposed to be completely quiet in terms of the soundtrack, and yet the atmosphere is ruined when the PS4 Pro is growling away as if it’s getting ready to detonate.\nNot for the first time, you wish that Naughty Dog cared as much about gameplay innovation as it does about pushing the boundaries of narrative but The Last Of Us Part 2’s story is powerful enough that it lifts the whole experience; much as was the case with the original. The story is not just well told but meaningful and universally relevant. Not so much in terms of the revenge plot but how easy it is to dehumanise anyone you disagree with and to assume everything you do is right and anything they do is wrong.\nThroughout the game, Ellie’s motivation is love and yet the trail of death and destruction she leaves in her wake breeds nothing but hate and violence. These are heady concepts for an action video game, or any kind of popular entertainment, and while The Last Of Us Part 2 is not a perfect experience it is an absolutely essential one.\nThe Last Of Us Part 2 review summary\nIn Short: A milestone in action video game storytelling and while the gameplay is not nearly as inspired, the experience as a whole is one of the best of the generation.\nPros: The script and voice-acting is superb, but more importantly the story has purpose and something genuinely profound to say about action entertainment. Astonishingly good graphics.\nCons: The gameplay is competent but unremarkable, with little substantial improvement over the original.

            "text": "This discussion and review contains spoilers for The Last of Us episode 2, “Infected.”\nLike “When You’re Lost in the Darkness,” “Infected” is more efficient than exceptional.\nWritten by Craig Mazin and directed by Neil Druckmann, “Infected” feels very much like a video game adaptation. It is an episode that devotes a lot of time and effort to what might be considered “shoe leather,” the nitty-gritty mechanics that hold the world of the show together. It’s a chapter that is largely devoted to establishing and outlining what Tess (Anna Torv) describes as “ground rules.” There is a lot of exposition to be delivered.\nIn this sense, Ellie (Bella Ramsey) is a very convenient character. She has lived a sheltered existence inside the Boston Quarantine Zone and so doesn’t necessarily know the logic of the wider world. She is also a child, so it makes sense that she would be inquisitive. Mazin’s script cleverly uses Ellie as a springboard to convey the finer details of this post-apocalyptic landscape to the audience, structuring “Infected” like a road trip with a particularly talkative child.\nEllie voices the questions that audience members will undoubtedly have about the particulars of this zombie apocalypse. “If we’re out in the open city, why aren’t we getting swarmed?” she asks. Later, she complains, “Everyone said the open city was crazy, like swarms of infected just running around.” She even gets more specific. “So there aren’t super-infected that explode fungus spores over you?” she wonders. “Or ones with split-open heads that see in the dark like bats?”\nIt’s not elegant, but it works. However, as with “When You’re Lost in the Darkness,” it suffers a little bit from feeling so functional. At times, it can feel like reading a strategy guide or an instruction manual. “How long do infected live?” Ellie asks Joel (Pedro Pascal), when he stops her asking personal questions. He replies as if quoting a Wikipedia article, “Well, some last about a month or two, but there’s others been walking around for about twenty years.”\nTo give Mazin’s script credit, the script is clear in establishing and demonstrating the logic of the world. “You step on a patch of cordyceps in one place and you can wake a dozen infected from somewhere else,” Tess explains to Ellie at one point. “Now they know where you are. Now they come. You’re not immune from being ripped apart. You understand?” However, this is not exposition for its own sake. It is later demonstrated at the episode’s climax at the State House.\nThis is clean screenwriting. Mazin tells the audience something and then shows how it applies in action. For example, the episode’s flashback teaser finds Doctor Ibu Ratna (Christine Hakim) advising the Indonesian military to “bomb this city and everyone in it,” only for Tess and Joel to walk past bomb craters in Boston, revealing that militaries around the world did follow Ratna’s advice. “They hit most of the big cities like this,” Tess explains. “It worked here, but it didn’t in most places.”\nNone of this is bad storytelling, but it isn’t compelling television. As with “When You’re Lost in the Darkness” before it, it seems like Mazin and Druckmann are rushing through the obligatory world-building material to get to the point where the show can start working on its own terms. Even Tess’ death at the end of the episode feels more like a plot mechanic than an emotional beat, her final plea serving as a way to keep Joel with Ellie for just a little bit longer, kicking the pair’s inevitable bonding down the road.\nThis sense of obligation extends beyond Mazin’s teleplay and into Druckmann’s direction. It feels like a reductive criticism to argue that the creator of the source material is directing an episode that feels particularly dedicated to replicating the dynamics of the video game in question, but it doesn’t feel unfair. “Infected” ultimately looks and feels a lot like one might expect a television adaptation of a survival horror game to look, which is both a strength and a weakness.\nParticularly compared to the previous episode, “Infected” places a much greater emphasis on the idea of exploration and survival. Obviously, it takes the three characters outside of the Quarantine Zone and into the overgrown city, which means that the episode gets to take in the impressive vistas and environments of an urban center that has been reclaimed by nature. There is a lot of emphasis on characters moving through wide-open spaces, taking in the atmosphere and the mood.\nThis imagery is impressive, in both larger details like the collapsed skyscrapers and more intimate scenes like the overgrown restaurant. However, the challenges feel very external to the characters. “Infected” devotes a lot of time to movement and puzzle-solving, on route-mapping and evasion. These are the kinds of activities that are fun to do in a video game but less fun to watch other people do in a television show.\nAgain, as with the exposition and world-building, some of this feels like the show working through some mandatory aspects of adaptation. In particular, “Infected” draws quite heavily from some of the core dynamics of the video game itself. The trio encounter a couple of “clickers.” Tess and Joel prepare to journey into the museum by taking out their flashlights, another beloved piece of video game itinerary. Ellie even ends up wearing her flashlight, on her left shoulder, like in the game.\nThe attack at the museum feels very much an attempt to recreate the tension and excitement of a similar set piece in the game. Druckmann’s direction is solid, and the sequence is an efficient piece of zombie horror. At the same time, the entire confrontation feels like something that The Last of Us felt obligated to offer audiences at an early juncture, whether as an allusion to the video game or simply because that is how zombie movies and television shows work.\nTo be clear, there is nothing wrong with any of this. Indeed, even working through the motions of a classic survival horror template, both Druckmann and Mazin demonstrate a clear affection for the genre and an impressive craft. Watching “When You’re Lost in the Darkness” and “Infected,” it can occasionally feel like The Last of Us is going through the motions in terms of adapting the world of the video game to television, but there is an undeniable efficiency at play. The show knows what it is doing and why.\nIndeed, there are already hints at something more interesting and more compelling stirring beneath the surface, like the veins of Cordyceps that stretch underground. The show foregrounds its emphasis on family; the teaser ends with Ibu Ratna wanting “to be with (her) family,” and the episode then begins with the unlikely surrogate family of Joel, Tess, and Ellie waking up after spending their first night together under the same roof.\nThe Last of Us also positions itself as a western. A lot of post-apocalyptic tales are basically westerns, stories of civilization trying to endure in lawless worlds. Still, The Last of Us is more overt than most examples. The characters are literally pushing westward from Boston. Joel hopes to reunite with Tommy (Gabriel Luna) in Wyoming. Marlene (Merle Dandridge) wants Ellie taken “somewhere out west.” Tess asks, “Where did Marlene say she was taking you?” Ellie replies, “Just west.”\nFor all that these are stories about dystopian futures, they are also riffs on the founding myth of America. This is obvious even in the locations employed in “Infected.” The characters navigate a hotel, a transitory space for travelers and wanders. They confront the infected in a museum, surrounded by history even at the end of the world. The final confrontation takes place in the State House, a bastion of government that ends up consumed in flames.\nAs with the climate change subtext that plays through “When You’re Lost in the Darkness,” “Infected” is never clumsy or heavy-handed with this western iconography. While the characters exposit about the mechanics of the fungal plague that has consumed the world, they never acknowledge how their adventure is steeped in the tropes and conventions of the classic western. Indeed, Ellie is just about able to get Joel to confess that he is from Texas — prime cowboy country — before he shuts down the conversation.\nAs with the premiere, there is a sense that “Infected” is frontloading a lot of the mechanics and world-building necessary for the show to function. Given how much Mazin and Druckmann manage to cram into the episode, that’s something of an accomplishment. The Last of Us has spent its first two episodes establishing the rules of its world. However, the show has yet to fully come alive.\nRelated: Why Are There Tendrils Instead of Spores in The Last of Us on Twinfinite",

            "text": "What can you say about The Last of Us that hasn't been said prior? As Naughty Dog's crown jewel, the story of Joel and Ellie is a timeless one that has received more plaudits than the majority of games throughout history, taking home over 200 Game of the Year Awards. Now back on PlayStation 5 for its third release in less than a decade, everyone wants to know whether the remake is actually worth it.\nIt's a fair question. Naughty Dog is one of the most talented developers in the world, so the fact the studio felt it necessary to remake a game that has surpassed 20 million sales globally instead of focusing on another inevitable sequel or a new IP altogether is one well worth raising. It's also clear that the remake is a marketing tactic to help promote the upcoming The Last of Us TV series on HBO Max. So who is this remake really for?\nGoing forward, the PS5 remake is without a doubt the definitive way to experience the story. Anyone that hasn't played the game before needs to remedy that immediately, and there's no better starting point than here. Equally, those that have played only played the 2013 release and not the remaster will feel some benefits. For everyone else, including those truly devoted fans, it's hard to justify another purchase.\nNote: To find out more about the story, mechanics, music, and everything else about the original release, check out T3's 2013 The Last of Us review on PS3. This review will mainly be addressing the upgrades by Naughty Dog for the 2022 release on PS5.\nThe Last of Us Part 1 review: price and release date\n- What is it? A remake of the 2013 action-adventure from Naughty Dog\n- Release date? September 2, 2022\n- What platforms can I play it on? PS5\n- Price? $69.99 / £64.99 / AU$124.95\nThe Last of Us Part 1 review: what is it?\nSet 20 years after a fungal plague has decimated half of the human race, a survivor named Joel is tasked with escorting 14-year-old Ellie across the now post-apocalyptic US in hopes of creating a cure and ending the nightmare. Along the way, the pair encounter hunters, smugglers and various forms of infected humans, known as Clickers.\nAlongside this, The Last of Us Part 1 comes with The Last of Us: Left Behind DLC (it was included in the 2014 remaster too). The prequel tells the story of Ellie's relationship with her best friend, Riley, set before and during the events of the main game. I would deem it essential to the overall narrative, so don't skip out.\nNaughty Dog's aim for the remake was to bring the game closer in line to its \"original vision\" if the studio was not constrained by technology at the time. That seems harsh considering how striking the 2013 release was and still remains to be. So much has held up admirably well, be that the traumatic opening as I personally now rocket ever closer towards fatherhood (help), a deadly virus as we all 'exit' a global pandemic, or the simple things like Ellie learning to whistle over the course of the journey.\nNew ways to play through The Last of Us have been added, including a permadeath and speedrun mode. The former basically means if a player dies at any point during the game they have to restart the whole thing over again, although it can be tailored to per season or per chapter for those less daring. The latter is to test how fast the game can be beaten, perfect for the speedrunning community and Twitch. These both feel quite niche extras, with only a small percentage likely to use them.\nOn top of this, there are now more unlockable outfits, a model viewer mode to check out designs in greater detail, as well as the previously released The Last of Us podcast from the cast and crew and Director's Commentary. Great. What's not great is locking this all behind the player having to beat the game considering the number of returning players. Seems like an oversight. Furthermore, multiplayer (Factions) is absent altogether.\nThe Last of Us Part 1 review: how does it play?\nIt's a strange thing having the mechanics of a 2013 game coated in something that has graphics from 2022. It works, obviously. This is The Last of Us. It's just certain little things like Naughty Dog's obsession with moving crates, or how Joel crouches down to awkwardly craft which have become a bit comical at this point.\nThe Last of Us gameplay has players controlling either Joel or Ellie from a third-person perspective, as they progress through cities and wilderness across the US. Players can shoot using pistols, shotguns, rifles and more, however, bullets are sparse meaning stealth or fleeing is sometimes the better option. Molotovs and nail bombs are also examples of weapons that can be crafted. If not, hand-to-hand combat is an option.\nHaptic feedback improvements now mean that combat is further enhanced, felt in every punch thrown. Likewise, the adaptive triggers have been taken advantage of – most noticeably when using the bow and arrow. I did feel weapons across the board utilised the technology better in Sniper Elite 5, though, providing a better push and pull that I rarely found with standard weapons in The Last of Us.\nAI has received an upgrade. Enemies are now more aware of Joel's presence while stealth has been enhanced to avoid buddies running into the path of others. I still found Ellie getting caught in front of enemies just as much as in the original, so there's still some way to go to make it seamless. Very few technical issues were apparent, aside from a couple of minor bugs where ladders or skips would go through surfaces momentarily.\nMotion matching is another tech that makes characters follow logic to try and match the desired movement from hundreds of different animations to replicate real-life scenarios. It sounds impressive, I just never really spotted the difference. Is that bad? I appreciate the feature but things like this often seep into the background. Naughty Dog has also integrated its extensive accessibility system, including audio description built-in to the cinematics – a first for a PlayStation game, according to the studio. Huge applause for this. Having more people be able to play a game comfortably is only a positive.\nThe Last of Us Part 1 review: how does it look and sound?\nNow onto what is arguably the biggest question of the lot: is the graphical upgrade worth it? The answer is yes and no. My mixed feelings stem from the fact that, on one hand, the new overhaul in models, textures, environments, lighting, and pretty much everything you can think of is clearly a step up. It's gorgeous! A truly stunning game, only amplified by the new next-gen capabilities.\nOn the other hand, I do think some of the original's gritty charm has been lost. The streets were more grubby, the characters felt more dishevelled, it's a consequence of updating old games to today's standards. The lighting plays a big part in this, working well in more grassy areas but putting an unnecessary shine on buildings. Additionally, I prefer the look of the giraffe in the original. I don't know why. I get it's more lifelike but I miss its adorable wide eyes. There I said it.\nNew workbench animations fall much more in line with the sequel, watching Joel carefully upgrade a pistol's magazine bit by bit is awe-inspiring... even if it does feel slightly tedious. What does feel more of an upgrade are the breathtaking vistas, giving a wider scope of the surrounding areas in the likes of Boston, Pittsburgh, Salt Lake City and Wyoming. The same can be said for destructible objects, shattering more glass or firing off chunks of wood when penetrated by bullets.\nFrom the technical specifications, The Last of Us Part 1 offers 4K resolution at 30 frames per second or dynamic 4K resolution at 60 frames per second. These are outlined in Performance and Fidelity modes within the settings. I always opted for performance, yet still felt I was reaping the rewards of its graphical overhaul. HDR support is also available.\nFinally, while the subtle soundtrack by Gustavo Santaolalla is untouched (rightly so), 3D audio has been integrated, all with the aim of creating better immersion. This works best when in the dankest conditions when being stalked by Clickers, helping to identify where the infected are attacking from. On a couple of occasions, it did make me jump as a result.\nThe Last of Us Part 1 review: how long to beat?\nAs this is my fifth time playing through The Last of Us, I can roll credits in a good 10 hours or so. Anyone attempting the game for the very first time will likely be closer to 16 hours. Naturally, this is all dependent on how you explore the world. Are you the kind of person that reads every scrap of paper, likes to grab every Firefly pendant as well as all other collectables to pop the Platinum trophy? If so, I'd say the playtime will be around 25 hours for newcomers.\nThe Last of Us: Left Behind takes approximately two hours, again extending to around three if you want to find all of the collectables. It's absolutely worth experiencing, just as integral to the main story while fleshing out Ellie's backstory.\nVerdict\nThe Last of Us Part 1 is still one of the best games of the last decade and an absolute must-play for newcomers. For anyone making the unforgettable journey with Joel and Ellie for the very first time, this is a five-star experience. Despite that, due to a lack of incentives – aside from the graphical glow-up – as well as a steep price of entry, it's hard to justify a second (or even third) purchase for returning players.\nAlso consider\nThe logical suggestion for anyone that enjoys The Last of Us will be to play its 2020 sequel, The Last of Us Part 2. While not spoiling anything, it does feature a controversial story that split the fanbase but likewise brought about some interesting discussions. If you're looking for something lighthearted, then do check out the Uncharted series from Naughty Dog, which features fun Indiana Jones-like globetrotting adventures. With the Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection launching on PS5 earlier this year, it's the perfect time to jump in.",

            "text": "Naughty Dog’s The Last of Us Part II recently picked up ” Game of the Year” at The Game Awards, amongst other awards, and it’s safe to say that it deserves that honour. Here’s our review on The Last of Us Part II.\nThis Review has been a long time in the making, I know. When I first played The Last of Us Part II, like many of you, I was a little overwhelmed. In a way, The Last of Us Part II suffered a similar pre-launch fate to Cyberpunk 2077; it was woefully over-hyped and many of us went into the opening segments of gameplay expecting to be quite-literally blown away.\nTLOU2 also suffered a launch date delay which undoubtedly exacerbated things. It made me anxious, yet all-the-more excited. I am yet to play a Naughty Dog title I haven’t thoroughly enjoyed and if they needed a few more months to perfect things, that was fine with me! I also, somehow, managed to avoid major spoilers throughout my first playthrough back in June. I’ve played it again, since then, too.\nNow, I have decided to boot up The Last of Us Part II on my PlayStation 5 and dived right into a Grounded Mode playthrough.\nRELATED: The Last Of Us 2: Haptic Feedback Supported on PS5\nThis review is being written about six hours into that, after two complete play-throughs.\nThe Last Of Us Part II Is A Masterclass Of Narrative Design\nFirstly, I think it goes without saying that whatever you think about the The Last of Us Part II narrative… It was expertly designed to surprise players, subvert expectations, and get the most out of it’s characters.\nI wouldn’t go as far as to say that The Last of Us Part II is my favourite game this year, nor my favourite narrative. However, the way the story of TLOU2 is told is truly magnificent. Right from the start, we are introduced to a dual-protagonist narrative which hinges on the idea that perspective is everything when it comes to how people experience their world.\nJoel, Ellie, and Tommy all feature in the opening sequences and very-briefly bridge the gap between the end of The Last of Us and the start of the sequel. However, after barely an hour we are introduced to a completely new set of characters. It’s the first of many curve-balls and leaves you guessing right from the off.\nAs you begin to learn who Abby and her friends are, why they are in Jackson… Who they are after… You’re hooked. Not only do you fear for Joel and Ellie, in disbelief that anything bad could happen to them, you also want to know Abby’s side of the story. Her determination is palpable. From her first conversation with Owen, she feels real. What The Last of Us Part II does perfectly is the avoidance of having a villain.\nAbby may seem like a villain from Ellie’s point of view, but the same could be said about Joel from Abby’s point of view. Neither are portrayed as a villain throughout the opening sequences of the game. Of course, it goes without saying that what Abby did to Joel was brutal. However… This twist is exactly what The Last of Us Part II needed after the woefully predictable narrative of The Last of Us.\nThe Last of Us was in no way a bad game, but it was hardly surprising. There were little things, like Sam turning, but there was nothing on a comparable scale. Being re-introduced to Joel and Ellie living ” happily” in Jackson, something big had to happen to shake-up the status quo. Thankfully, it did.\nThe Last of Us Part II threads the parallel storylines of Ellie’s Experience and Abby’s Experience perfectly to create a gripping narrative that balances the motivation of selfish revenge and the consequences that come of that.\nThe only issue I have with how Naughty Dog have constructed their narrative for The Last of Us Part II is that the shocking revelation of Joel’s Death happens so early. Although, I am still myself undecided on how I truly feel about this… I find myself both annoyed and understanding at it’s placement.\nThe sequence of events that leads to Joel’s death starts during an Abby Section of the game. You know that she is in Jackson looking for someone and instantly your mind suspects it may be one of the Miller brothers: the only two main male characters we really know at this point. However, when she runs into Tommy and Joel and they begin to work together… I found myself a little taken aback, doubting my own suspicions. Perhaps I was wrong? Abby hasn’t done anything that would suggest that she’s a villainous character after all.\nWhen things turn… Joel’s fate is left up in the air and we re-join Ellie in her search for Joel and Tommy. Like everyone else who liked Joel, you fear the worst but hope for the best. The next few moments playing as Ellie are emotionally charged and all-the-more intense for this. It is, arguably, one of the best parts of the game despite it being short and largely uninteresting. It makes you sit on the edge of your seat, anxious and concerned, with a lump in your throat.\nWe all know what happens next… Even if you haven’t played The Last of Us Part II, the controversy caused by this scene in-particular has been a talking point since it’s launch. My issue with it all is that, if you look at gameplay playthroughs, this moment happens at around two-to-three hours into the game ( depending on how long you decide to wander around in each area for, of course). I understand why it comes so early in the game; it’s a shocking moment that allows the rest of the game to attempt to subvert our perceptions of Ellie and Abby. As Ellie continues down her path of revenge, we start to see her in a negative light. Similarly, as we start to see Abby’s story we begin to understand why she did what she did.\nHowever, part of me feels that we should have seen more of Abby’s build-up to her killing of Joel. Naughty Dog wants you to think Abby is the villain and, in a way, should have been expecting the kick-back they got. Obviously, some people took it way too far… But, for the most part, the outrage people felt was intentionally created. It then almost feels as if the rest of Abby’s story is back-peddling… “Oh, she’s not actually this evil because Joel killed her dad first”.\nAfter two playthroughs and six months, I still find myself conflicted on this pivotal moment in The Last of Us Part II. Perhaps that is the whole point of it, though. The Last of Us is a cross-generational masterpiece that has stuck with players for years… Part II isn’t any different.\nCan we talk about Yara and Lev now, though? Almost.\nIn The Last of Us Part II, both Ellie and Abby are consumed by revenge. Abby’s comes first, with her murder of Joel, whereas Ellie’s comes later as we follow her on the hunt for Abby. Both these storylines have each character killing the loved ones of the other and makes for a truly compelling duel between the two. However, the latter stages of Abby’s storyline are the best parts of The Last of Us Part II and shouldn’t be ignored in the overshadowing controversy of Joel’s death.\nEllie’s story, both in The Last of Us and The Last of Us Part II is self-centred and narrow. It symbolises her immaturity and impulsive nature, but does little to explore the world created by Naughty Dog. Ellie only ever focuses on what’s immediately in-front of her and her own motivations. This reinforces her position as a flawed protagonist, something which isn’t touched on as much in The Last of Us but is definitely still there.\nAbby, however, if nothing else, has allowed Naughty Dog to explore the world of The Last of Us outside Ellie’s personal bubble. Abby-too focuses a lot on what’s in front of her own motivations, however, she has a better understanding of expectations and responsibility that Ellie just doesn’t fully understand. This isn’t to say Abby is perfect, she isn’t by a long shot. However, she at-least tries to be a good person when faced with the opportunity to help others.\nAs an older character, her experiences influence her actions and her world-knowledge is one of the drastic differences between her character and Ellie’s. She suffers from a lack of forethought, same as Ellie does, as both chase their own revenge. But, through the section of her storyline with Yara and Lev we learn that she’s not as bad as we all thought.\nAbby is a former firefly, after all. With this association comes all the feelings from The Last of Us, how Ellie holds them in such high regard. We know that they’re trying to do something good, and Joel’s selfishness stops that. Despite her misgivings, Abby still holds that motivation to do good throughout the remainder of her storyline in The Last of Us Part II. When she realises Yara and Lev need her help, she goes out of her way to do her best for them.\nIt may take a while to get there, which is my biggest issue, but eventually we see the complicated nature of both Abby and Ellie’s characters. They are deeply emotional, strong, complex protagonists that ultimately feel human. The way Naughty Dog use narrative design to achieve this is astounding and well-worth all the awards it has won.\nEach New Character Only Builds On The World Created In TLOU\nAbby isn’t the only new character in The Last of Us Part II. Naughty Dog have, with every secondary and tertiary character, delivered a fantastic array of personalities through brilliant characterisation which all help to further build the world established in The Last of Us.\nOn Team Ellie, Dina and Jessie are the two stand-out additions. Both Dina and Jessie are fiercely loyal to Ellie, helping her on her quest for revenge with little question. On Team Abby, Owen and Mel are the two most prominent characters of her supporting cast. Both are there to help Abby on her hunt for Joel, however they often question the situation. This, again, highlights the age difference between Ellie and her friends in comparison to Abby, Owen, and Mel. The phrase ” young and reckless” comes to mind and, perhaps, is fitting to this situation.\nWhat it comes down to is the selfishness that comes hand-in-hand with a naivety and lack of experience. Ellie doesn’t fully realise her responsibility to her friends and Jackson, whereas Abby does realise her responsibility to her friends and the W.L.F. Then, we see Abby continue with her quest for revenge despite those questioning it and the consequences speak for themselves.\nThese additional characters do more than add context to the actions of the protagonists, though. They are all also deeply complex, with their own motivations and agency which help drive the narrative forward and keep you guessing about how things might play out.\nI may not have a particular character I hate in The Last of Us Part II, albeit I don’t really care for Manny, but I do have favourites…\nOkay, now it’s time to talk about Yara and Lev.\nTo put it plainly, Yara and Lev are fantastic. Not only do they help to facilitate Abby’s character development, they also introduce us to the wider world created for the The Last of Us series. Through this pair, we get an insight into Seraphites. This religious cult is largely an antagonistic force throughout The Last of Us Part II, however, through Yara and Lev you quickly learn that the conflict between the W.L.F. and the Seraphites is counter-intuitive to human survival and ultimately doing more harm than good.\nLev is perhaps the most relatable character in The Last of Us Part II. Despite his own traumatic experiences he continues to attempt to see the good in people, yet still finds enjoyment and wonder is the little things. He is used to manifest Abby’s guilt for her actions earlier in the narrative and also acts as a fresh reminder that there is hope in the world still.\nThat being said… Lev is also used to highlight that the world we live in today is drastically flawed. While playing, I felt bad for Ellie sure… But I wasn’t really emotionally invested until Lev. Lev is being hunted and is hated purely for wanting to live. It is a harsh, but important reminder, that these parts of human society exist still. The fact that his introduction caused so much outrage is reason enough for his inclusion.\nThe Last of Us Part II is grounded in exploring human emotion and showcasing the human experience. Lev, much like Ellie and Abby, is a part of that experience. His story is one that deserves to be told and highlights both the best and the worst of our society.\nAlthough I think that short gameplay sequence prior to Joel’s death is the most intense, Lev’s return to his home on the Seraphite’s island is by-far the most emotional. Lev arrives at his home desperately hopeful that he can see and save his mother. He runs off ahead of Abby so we only find the aftermath of their encounter. Rather than act with love and compassion, as we would expect any mother to, she lashes out at Lev.\nShe is so staunch in her Seraphite beliefs that she has turned her back on Lev on the sole basis that he wants to live life as a man. It is a truly heart-breaking revelation that is capitalized on by Ian Alexander’s stellar acting performance. Coming away from this moment, I was met with a flood of emotions. It also, in a way, helped me to understand Ellie’s storyline.\nMuch like Lev has lost a parental figure, Ellie has now lost hers. Ellie has someone to blame, though, which is a key difference in the two experiences. Ellie’s reaction and hunger for vengeance is rooted in pain and suffering. Lev has experienced the same thing, if not on a much larger scale, yet he has no one to blame. Thus, he blames himself. Although I can’t speak from any first-hand knowledge, I imagine that this experience is one shared by a lot of men and women. It is also an experience that everyone should be able to relate with, even without that first-hand knowledge and experience.\nThe Last of Us Part II forces you to dwell on the best and the worst of the human experience and our society. For better, or worse, you are pulled deeply into the emotional trauma brought about by loss, revenge, abandonment, hatred, and love.\nGraphically, The Last Of Us Part II Is Near-Incomparable\nI think this one goes without saying, but I’m going to say it anyway. The Last of Us Part II looks fucking incredible. From the character models to the environmental details, everything is almost the best it can be. Obviously, some graphical improvements can be made… But when you take into account that the title was made to perform on a PlayStation 4, you can make appeasements. In terms of fidelity, it outshines every other game of the year on the platform.\nIn addition to this, The Last of Us Part II is a welcome return to realistic character animations that I find are often missing from a lot of games nowadays. Whether you’re playing as Abby or Ellie, neither of them can jump abnormally high or scale a seemingly unclimbable wall. Each melee attack feels laboured and impactful. It all works towards reinforcing the grounded nature of the world created in The Last of Us and reflects the fact that the game is rooted in real experiences and emotions.\nIt’s also worth expressing particularly that the environmental work done by Naughty Dog is truly incredible. It may not be an open-world game, so it doesn’t suffer from the dangers of having too much empty space, but each location is packed with detail and character which helps make the world seem alive. The Last of Us Part II is larger in scope than The Last of Us and thus contains a wider-array of settings which all feel wonderfully different from one another.\nEven without what could be defined as ‘ Ray-Tracing technology’, the lighting in The Last of Us Part II is outstanding.\nI know this isn’t strictly about ” graphics”, but the way the player and characters interact with the environment in The Last of Us Part II is something a lot of other titles could learn lessons from.\nThis comment goes hand-in-hand with my praise for TLOU2‘s character animations, in a way, but it’s the little things that set it apart from the crowd. The way they leave footsteps and trails in the snow, for example… Or how the long-grass reacts as you crawl through it. Even the way the weapon strap hangs from the gun you’re holding. All of these little details and animations are well-thought out and make you truly feel that you are a part of the world you are experiencing.\nThe Semi-Open World Areas Are Underutilized, Though\nI know, I know. Like I said, no one’s perfect and The Last of Us Part II isn’t any different. There area few semi-open areas in the game which invite the player to explore their surroundings and tackle the problems their own way. Much like a lot of what features in this game, it’s The Last of Us enhanced to the next level.\nThe only issue with this, particularly the earlier segments in Seattle is that I was left wanting more. There are a few side-activities and areas to explore asides from the main objectives and storyline, but they don’t seem to offer any real reward. They’re time-killers that offer interesting tid-bits of information but in no-way do you need to do it and you’re not really missing out if you continue with the main storyline.\nThat being said, The Last of Us Part II isn’t an open-world game so I found myself a little indifferent on the matter. With the game already being wonderfully deep and complex, it’s a minor issue. Still, that being said, I would have liked to have seen more from all these character-specific narratives that cross over with Abby and Ellie’s stories and experiences.\nIt Also Suffers From ” LotR Extended Edition Ending” Syndrome\nWhen I talk about “LotR Extended Edition Ending” Syndrome, allow me to explain… Just when you think Return of the King is over, there’s another scene. Then, you’ve seen Old Bilbo and you think that’s it. Right? Bam. Another ten minutes. By the end of it, you’re almost tired of it ending and it leaves a strange sour taste in your mouth.\nThe Last of Us Part II suffers from the same thing, despite it’s ending being drastically important.\n( It’s A Thing, Trust Me… )\nWhen we see Ellie and Dina at the Farm outside of Jackson, with JJ, I thought that was it. When we see Ellie’s PTSD, I thought that was it. When we see Tommy come back to say hello to them, I thought that was it. When I saw Abby and Lev searching for Fireflies, I thought that was it.\nIn all honesty, I was waiting for things to end on a cliff-hanger that sets up an Abby-Lev focused Part III. But, life doesn’t always work out how you’d hope it too and The Last of Us Part II’s ending perfectly represents that. It also highlights Ellie’s flaws and near-psychotic nature.\nIn those pre-ending scenes, she’s happy. She may not have killed Abby, but she made it out alive when she probably shouldn’t have. She has Dina, and JJ, and Tommy… She’s alive. But, that isn’t enough. The final hours of the game reinforces the thematic premises from the earlier moments: revenge is poisonous and ultimately bad.\nWe know Ellie is desperate, but her continued pursuit of Abby and their final confrontation almost seems too far to those of us on the outside of it all. It reinforces how much Joel’s death damaged Ellie and helps to further deconstruct the notion that she is “the good guy”. Like I said at the start of this review, “the idea that perspective is everything“.\nBy the end of The Last of Us Part II, Ellie isn’t the person we thought they were at the start and neither is Abby.\nHowever, A Few New Mechanics Keep The Game Fresh\nThat being said, the gameplay throughout The Last of Us Part II is on par with the best games and keeps it exciting and fun to play. Although the core gameplay is largely the same, there are a few moments where new features took me by surprise. For example, the segments when you play the guitar. Sadly, not many titles utilise the Dualshock’s touch-pad. When it is used, I am happy. It’s really that simple.\nPlaying the guitar is not-only fun to do in The Last of Us Part II, it’s also hugely symbolic of Ellie’s relationship to Joel. When she returns to the farm in the final scenes of the game, without a few of her fingers, she realises that she can no-longer play. In a lot of ways, this is one of the only things she is left with from Joel.\nEllie threw away almost everything for a shot at revenge and came to the realisation that revenge isn’t the answer. The guitar-playing mechanic might seem a pointless addition early on, but it’s symbolism is a testament to the storytelling implemented throughout The Last of Us Part II.\nThe game also features updated combat mechanics that are fine-tuned to represent the difference in physicality and experience between Abby and Ellie. They are subtle differences which are highlighted by the unique weapons they use, but it does a lot in helping to make each character play differently. Playing as Abby isn’t just a reskinned experience… She’s stronger, trained with firearms… More of a soldier, as her background would suggest.\nPeople outraged with the decision to give The Last of Us Part II the Game of the Year award seem to forget that there’s more to a game than just it’s story. TLOU2 plays exceptionally well in combat, stealth, and exploration and is driven by realistic physics which only enhance the experience.\nIt is also worth noting that the crafting and upgrades system from The Last of Us is back in greater depth. There are now multiple skill branches that relate to different aspects of gameplay. For example, we can see there is a Survival branch… The inclusion of multiple disciplines forces you to manage your resources more efficiently as you play. This is especially true on harder difficulties.\nThe crafting system is not too different, but if it isn’t broke… You can craft items and consumables on the fly and improve weapons at Workbenches. On higher difficulties, these items are all-the-more useful and their inclusion brings a degree of strategy to the title.\nIt Isn’t Perfect, But It’s Damn Good\nI don’t think I will ever be able to fully surmise how I feel about The Last of Us Part II and I commend anyone who can. It’s a rich, detailed, emotional experience which is meant to create more questions and answers.\nThe Last of Us Part II is a masterpiece in every aspect. It’s storytelling is unparalleled. Graphically, it’s a testament to every concept artist, character and environmental artist, and level designer out there. In terms of gameplay, it’s an incredible achievement for motion capture artists, animators, and programmers.\nIt also goes without saying that the starring cast of voice actors and performance capture artists are at the top of their game and without them, The Last of Us Part II would be half as special.\nRELATED: HBO’s The Last of Us Series – A Discussion\nTroy Baker as Joel, Ashley Johnson as Ellie, Laura Bailey as Abby, Jeffrey Pierce as Tommy, Shannon Woodward as Dina, Victoria Grace as Yara, Ian Alexander as Lev… There isn’t one performance throughout which isn’t truly exceptional.\n[penci_review]\nThe Last of Us Part II is a must-play title for anyone with the chance too. It isn’t just one of the best video games of 2020, but it’s one of the best video games in history.\nLike what you see? Don’t forget to share our work with the buttons below!

            "spaceyToken": "Generational",
            "text": "Generational pain\nDespite playing every one of their recent award-winning games, I still can’t believe Naughty Dog went from “the Crash Bandicoot company” to a cornerstone of the age-old “games are art” conversation. Every once in a while when looking at Joel or Nathan Drake, I imagine Crash going “Booyah Grandma.”\nBut that just goes to show you how impactful Naughty Dog really is when it comes to the wide world of gaming. Crash, Jak and Daxter, Uncharted, and Last of Us all made big splashes when they were released and arguably have enduring appeal (I’m going to bat for the first few Jak games here).\nLast of Us Part II is no exception, improving what its predecessor did all those years before it.\nThe Last of Us Part II (PS4)\nDeveloper: Naughty Dog\nPublisher: Sony\nReleased: June 19, 2020\nMSRP: $59.99\nKicking off with essentially recapping the ending to the first game, Part II feels like a true continuation. There’s no weird esoteric side tangent from an unnamed character to parse: it hits the ground running and tells a cohesive emotional story with Ellie at the helm. Ashley Johnson is still fantastic as Ellie all these years on, and she has a whole lot more to work with in the sequel as she delves further and further into the survivor identity that Joel has molded her into.\nA lot has changed since the first game was released in 2013 (!), and Naughty Dog was able to marry recent technological advances with nuanced emotional storytelling in a meaningful fashion. It sounds hyperbolic, but much like a performance in a prestige film or television series, microexpressions and simple acts like lip smacking add a human element to Part II in a way that many other games have only tried to accomplish. You know how you start to notice a significant other’s idiosyncrasies over time, for better or worse? I experienced that very tangible and human sensation with most of Part II‘s cast.\nBeyond the impressive full-body performances from the cast, credit goes to Last of Us boss Neil Druckmann and his co-directors Anthony Newman and Kurt Margenau, who really draw the most out of the talent and allow the camera to linger in a way that captures the emotion of each scene. While many moments in the original Last of Us were filler-oriented, the sequel’s script is mostly meat. Sometimes scenes are very low key, but those moments actually matter, with dialogue containing themes that echo throughout the story in more subtle ways.\nThe splendor of the environments augments those performances. By resisting the urge to go fully open-world, Naughty Dog was able to meticulously design chapter-based sandboxes, making them feel cohesive, but not overwhelming. Although they’re arguably too linear in some cases (more on that in a moment), the zones often feel like characters themselves given how much personality they exhume. A few of them are absolutely burned in my brain and persist in my mind’s eye long after clearing the campaign. I can see them as clear as day.\nWhile that echelon of budget is what you’d expect out of a 2020 first-party production, gameplay-wise, Part II doesn’t really provide any surprises, or elevate the survival-action genre. And that’s mostly okay, as this is a character-driven game, even if it gets grating. There’s still lots of scripted moments with NPCs and some light QTEs (mainly mashing while grappling, that sort of non-annoying thing). Last of Us Part II also seems to have more “oh the door is locked, let’s find another way around” moments than any other game I’ve ever played. A clear-cut runner-up: portions where you’re strictly running forward, then holding the Triangle button to open a door at the end of a path.\nPicking up items and crafting them is still tedious given the stringent item limits and slow rate of acquiring new abilities, not to mention the so-so efficacy of some of the early-game items. Limiting ammo is fine as it fits with the post-apocalyptic theme — but there aren’t a whole lot of new ways to approach situations this time. Even so, it does all come together in the end when you’re actually engaging in stealth or combat. The dodge-heavy melee system is effective because of how brutal and simple it all is, as is the act of sneaking around and causing distractions.\nI think what Last of Us does really well as a series is hammer in the theme that you’re not a superhero, both physically and emotionally. That doesn’t mean it can’t be a power fantasy (this game is full of believable badasses), but the grounded nature of having to stab people in the neck while they squirm hits home more than most unattached stealth romps. More-so than the initial entry, The Last of Us Part II isn’t afraid to get dark, which includes rampant dog-murder.\nAs someone who hasn’t eaten meat in many years, sometimes I find the prospect of even consuming flesh digitally unappealing (don’t freak out, it doesn’t stop me from playing or anything!), so dog killing can be fairly harrowing when it’s sparingly attempted by creatives. You might be freaked out by it, but that’s kind of the point — and it’s probably going to be the least controversial aspect of Part II. Not that it’s that controversial in the first place.\nYou’re going to be freaked out a lot, actually, as Part II maintains a consistent level of tension far more than the original did. Part II is what I’d call “Worrying: The Game,” as its cast is thrown into the ringer multiple times, with a scant few cheap shock-value moments spliced in (among many that feel earned). Some arcs are rushed, but for the most part, I felt a genuine connection to the main cast and experienced an immense amount of empathy for them. While I won’t spoil the main beats here, suffice to say we will be talking about them soon enough.\nAs a bit of housekeeping, there’s no multiplayer this time: and as far as options and tweaks go, Part II is one of the most welcoming AAA games to date. There’s a host of accessibility controls, plus you can swap the difficulty at any time. New Game+ (unlocked after one playthrough) allows you to replay the story with upgrades and items in tow, which is a more enticing prospect when you can fully customize the difficulty across multiple options. (You can beef your stats up while making enemies smarter or more perceptive if you don’t like bullet sponges — bravo.) There’s also a gallery with some great concept art, including a ton of designs that never made it into the game.\nLike the original Last of Us, some people are going to come away underwhelmed, but the story beats and the characters driving them are the main draw. Part II doesn’t reinvent the wheel, but it gives us a lasting glimpse of a unique broken world full of broken people that’s worth visiting time and time again.\n[This review is based on a retail build of the game provided by the publisher.]",

            "text": "Reading The Game: 'The Last Of Us Part 2'\nFor years now, some of the best, wildest, most moving or revealing stories we've been telling ourselves have come not from books, movies or TV, but from video games. So we're running an occasional series, Reading The Game, in which we take a look at some of these games from a literary perspective. Warning: If you haven't played The Last of Us Part II yet, there are some spoilers ahead.\nIn the beginning, Ellie was just a young girl trying to survive the end of the world. She was a miracle — a child somehow immune to the fungal zombie plague that had decimated the world. Somewhere far away, there was a doctor who thought he could take what was inside Ellie and make a cure for everyone. To save everyone.\nAll she had to do was get there. And Joel — who'd already lost his own daughter, who was haunted by the things he'd already done to survive and wanted nothing to do with Ellie — was the man who had to take her.\nIn video games, risk is a feature.\nRisk is codified, incentivized, lauded, anchors the equations that drive decision-trees, is calculated as part of the experience. Potential risk is how encounters are built (is it worth fighting the over-leveled boss for the potential loot drop?) and mechanical risk defines how they play out (Heal now? Dodge now? Run?). Risk is something that video games understand because it is something that the player understands. We know that we are stepping into your 1080p, AAA murder simulator. We accept that (virtual) risk is part of the deal. It's why we've come.\nIt took months. Pretty much every minute of it was dangerous. Ellie and Joel grew close. She came to see him as a father, and he saw her like the daughter he'd lost. They risked their lives for each other a hundred times and, against all odds, they made it to the hospital, to the doctor.\nThat was when they told Joel what had to happen: That in order to make the cure and save the world, Ellie had to die.\nBut in being expected, is it really risk? Because if we know it's coming — if we understand that the zombies are brain-hungry all the time and the Nazis are blood-thirsty all the time and all the monsters are out to kill us all the time — then the risk feels less like possibility (the potential to get something or see something or experience something in trade for an elevated chance of imaginary death) and more like inevitability. A box checked on a form. And if the risk/reward corollary is so baked into the very essence of gaming — if, in fact, it can be argued that there is no game without risk and reward — then what can a game do to make risk feel ... risky?\nNarrative risk.\nJoel refused. He hadn't spent all this time keeping Ellie alive just to see her die now. And when simply saying no wasn't enough, Joel killed every person in the room — including the doctor who knew how to make the cure. He took Ellie and he ran. He never told her what he'd done. He hoped she'd never find out.\nNarrative risk is the opposite of gameplay risk. Where simple risk and reward is essential to the functioning of any game, narrative risk is anathema because narrative risk is actually dangerous. It has the potential to alienate players, damage franchises and upend expectations; to cause hurt feelings and push against calcified notions of what games are for.\nThe reason games follow a three-act structure, chart redemption arcs, love a Big Bad, a Twist Reveal and a Boss Battle is that those things have proven to work in the past. They're the dependable, sturdy, straightforward rigging on which to hang whatever story you want to tell. And when there's years of work, thousands of employees and hundreds of millions of dollars on the line, narrative risk can seem like something to engineer out, not design for.\nNow, it's years later. There's still no cure. Joel and Ellie have found themselves a town to live in, a community to be a part of. He's teaching her to play guitar. She's found friends her age, work that she's good at, a girl in town that she likes. They're adapting. The world is moving on.\nAnd then we meet Abby.\nReal narrative risk (particularly in a big, high-profile, studio game) is rare. To do something that fundamentally alters the player's experience with your game takes guts and a commitment to storytelling that puts the purity of narrative first, and everything else second. And that's what The Last Of Us 2 is saying when it chooses to split its narrative in half: That story matters more than gameplay, more than comfort or consistency, more than a player's identification with this character or that one. It's insisting that there's something to say that can only be said, by doing something actually risky — first presenting us with Ellie's story, and then, later, offering us a new perspective, an entirely new story. It gives us Abby's story.\nIt makes us play as the person we hate most.\nThere's a moment in this game that you will never forget. It comes early. It is shocking and terrible in its violence and in the way it changes everything. It is a single choice that permanently and irrevocably changes everything. A choice that we misunderstand maybe, condemn maybe, loathe absolutely.\nIt's the moment where Abby kills Joel.\nEllie, we know. Ellie has been with us (has been us) since the start. Ellie and Joel's relationship is long and deep and powerful — strained sometimes, particularly in the opening hour of TLOU2, but real.\nBriefly, we play as Joel. We're him when he goes out on patrol with his brother Tommy and we're him when everything goes wrong. Along the way, Joel does a good thing by rescuing a woman cut off from her friends and under threat from the zombies. Joel doesn't know her. But we do.\nThat woman is Abby.\nWe're Ellie again when Ellie watches Abby beat Joel to death.\nWe're Ellie when Ellie swears revenge.\nWe're Ellie when she lights out for Seattle with her girlfriend Dina, hunting for Abby and Abby's friends, meaning to kill every last one of them. And we're Ellie while she does exactly that, relishing her vengeance, even when it turns ugly. Because these are the people who killed Joel, and for a while, that's all we know. That's all that matters until the midpoint of the game when, suddenly, TLOU2 makes us play as Abby and forces us to come to grips with who she is and why she did what she did.\nBecause Abby has spent years hunting Joel. She has made terrible sacrifices and done some awful things just to get to Joel. Because Abby? She was the teenaged daughter of the doctor who was supposed to cure the zombie plague. She was there (off screen, out of sight) when Joel murdered her father.\nTLOU2 could've just been a run-of-the-mill revenge story, but it isn't. Instead, it fashions itself into a parable about the futility of revenge and the way that violence only begets more violence. It leans into the cognitive dissonance of a universe where everyone is supposed to be both bloody-handed and noble by making no one noble, no one right, no one innocent. It forces us into choices that we tell ourselves we would never make by making them the choices of characters who absolutely would make them. It makes us understand why.\nNo matter how much we yell at the screen, the story unfolds the way it is meant to. The only way it could. Walking in Abby's shoes and experiencing the story through her eyes, we see that her vengeance is just as earned, just as necessary and just as pointless as Ellies. In Abby's world, Joel was the monster. The man who killed her father. And she is no more or less good than Ellie. No more or less evil. Thus, we become the mechanism of vengeance, the instrument of violence, locked into a two-sided story which allows for no other ending. It uses our expectations against us as it winds into nesting cycles of violence and sacrifice. It understands how dangerous it is being, and doesn't flinch.\nNarrative risk should be dangerous. That's the point. It's easy to tell a story with no real stakes — where no one changes and everyone gets to feel good about their choices. But this, of course, is how we end up with dull games. Pretty-but-stupid blockbusters that play so smooth and feel so familiar that we forget about them even as we're in the middle of them. Because without narrative risk, all the other risk just feels rote.\nAnd TLOU2 is a game that reckons with precisely that idea. There are other risks it takes (the centering of unconventional characters, dealing with the trauma of violence, deliberately breaking the narrative flow with slow, quiet flashbacks that ignore the kill-loot-kill feedback loop in favor of deep character development), but its biggest swing is the structural choice to split its story into competing, oppositional perspectives, forcing the player to contend with the consequences of their own actions and to wonder at what point the cycle of violence and the duty of vengeance has become too much for anyone to bear.\nJason Sheehan knows stuff about food, video games, books and Starblazers.

As with the first instalment, the latest in Naughty Dog’s survival horror saga is among the last of its era – a kind of grand finale for the current PlayStation.\nPerhaps because of this, it’s showing off a little too much, with a visualisation of a post-apocalyptic America that can feel too big and dramatic. But it’s an extraordinary achievement, technically unmatched and smarter in its player engagement than anything the studio has created before.\nSet four years after the events of the first game, main characters Joel and Ellie are part of a flourishing community in Wyoming that’s managed to shelter from ‘the infected’ (zombies created by a brain-invading fungus). Of course, this can’t last, and soon enough a terrible event (no plot spoilers here) triggers a new journey, primarily focused on Ellie.\nAs with the first game and Naughty Dog’s Uncharted series, what immediately impresses is the detail in the characters. The animation as Ellie converses with those around her is embellished with meaningful glances and subconscious mannerisms, and their incidental chatter as they explore is perfectly pitched in response to the unfolding action. It’s still a little jarring that everyone shares similar laidback speech styles and humour, but the naturalness to their interactions is far above that in most AAA titles.\nEven more remarkable is the game’s depiction of a decaying Seattle, where a significant chunk of the story takes place. The crumbling skylines are often stunning, while the interiors of its countless explorable locations are packed with tiny visual flourishes, from cracking shards of glass on the floor, to smudges on windows or dust settled on a guitar.\nTogether, the character and world design make every building worth exploring, not merely to loot supplies, but to see how it bears witness to life before and after the outbreak. This is a game experienced from the perspective of youth, who only know about the old society from their elders or salvaged cultural artefacts. Through their eyes the everyday trinkets, toys, murals and abandoned photos in a home, café, pet shop or theatre become wonders.\nRather than nostalgia, there’s a sense here of an alien civilisation that deserves pity for its innocence and complacency. At the same time, the whole experience of The Last of Us Part 2 feels more organic than before. This is literally the case with the environments, as human constructions are increasingly subsumed by greenery, but it spreads throughout your interactions with locations too. The rigid and repetitive structures of previous Naughty Dog games are far less obtrusive here.\nFor the most part, this remains a linear journey, divided into discrete chunks, with only one major section early on that really allows free exploration. Yet the joins between combat, exploration and story scenes are more blurred than before. Tell-tale signs of an upcoming combat section, such as conspicuous cover points are more naturally integrated into the scenery. Roving patrols in some areas, along with a few good old-fashioned jump scares, ensure the pacing doesn’t become predictable.\n“Together, the character and world design make every building worth exploring, not merely to loot supplies, but to see how it bears witness to life before and after the outbreak.”\nNavigation is more fluid too, with Ellie’s agile frame well suited to quick traversal. A lot of old, well-rehearsed Naughty Dog routines, like boosting up companions, or grabbing onto fragile ledges, are present but used sparingly. Puzzles are more spread out, with a larger array of elements involved, including some neat physics conundrums with ropes and cables. It’s never really taxing, as long as you’re mildly observant, but helps you to feel like you’re existing in a functioning reality.\nThe core challenge is of course in dealing with hostiles, whether it’s teams of human survivors hunting you down or nests of the hideous infected. Tense stealth is again the main ingredient, as enemies will quickly surround you once they have your position. Staying out of sight and sneaking up on individuals for a quick knife kill is often the safest way to proceed, but you also have recourse to distraction items, a bow for long-range silent assassinations, or Molotov cocktails, mines and a variety of guns for noisier confrontations.\nThis is all largely familiar, but Part 2 offers enough variety to stop encounters becoming routine. There’s greater complexity in the layouts in many sections, often with more tactical verticality than before or different means of cover, and in outdoor locations it’s now possible to sneak past patrols and escape without incident. The two main rival groups of humans you have to deal with, the Wolves and the Scars, are also tactically distinct prospects, and the infected have new tricks up their fungal coated sleeves.\nIt all makes for some stunning set pieces. A few of these are tightly choreographed chase sequences. Others, such as a Resident Evil like crawl through a ruined, pitch dark hotel teeming with infected, are more understated yet equally exhilarating. Throwing enemies of different types in together also makes for some wonderfully chaotic and unscripted scenes.\nEven so, some of the stealth mechanics are showing their age, and tread a fine line between tension and frustration. Human patrols can be large, and in enclosed spaces it’s easy to get pinned in a corner, unable to track all the lines of sight scanning the area. Progress isn’t necessarily difficult, but isn’t always satisfying either, if you end up relying on the generous checkpoints and trial and error, or wearily give up on the silent approach and reach for the shotgun. Thankfully, later parts of the game encourage more offensive play, and it’s a welcome release.\n“But it is a little too long, with too many big moments that fail to stick in the memory as they dissolve into more bloody violence. Personal tales are somewhat swamped by the scale of events, and it loses some of the intimacy of the first game.”\nThe bigger problem with having so many human enemies is its effect on the game’s narrative themes in relation to violence. The disconnect between the story and the killing is a perennial issue for Naughty Dog, and their attempts to confront it here only serve to highlight it more. The disturbing gurgles as you stab someone in the neck, or the anguished cry as their friend discovers their body, are supposed to add impact to your actions, but are so frequent that they turn into macabre voyeurism.\nThe story wants us to examine its damaged characters as they look for resolution in anger, with the implication that violence isn’t the answer. But for much of the game it is, and The Last of Us 2 can feel like its revelling in the brutality.\nOther aspects of the narrative are fascinating, especially its structure as it takes unexpected turns to gradually reveal the best and worst of humanity in the different sides of a conflict. It’s also commendable how Naughty Dog refuses to rush its plot, giving its characters and scenarios time to breathe.\nBut it is a little too long, with too many big moments that fail to stick in the memory as they dissolve into more bloody violence. Personal tales are somewhat swamped by the scale of events, and it loses some of the intimacy of the first game.\nIt seems that Naughty Dog doesn’t know when to stop pushing forward. This ambition has born a game of incredible energy and unprecedented quality, at the cost of some coherency and, according to reports from employees, a punishing work culture.\nIn every way, The Last of Us 2 is the grand culmination and skilful refinement of all the studio has done in the last decade or so. Hopefully by the last of the next generation, it will have found more effective ways to communicate its themes, and more reasonable ways to bring them to fruition.\nNaughty Dog has taken everything to the limit to create The Last of Us 2 – the PS4, its design template, and its staff. In some respects, it’s gone too far, but the results are undeniably spectacular and this is the studio’s best game yet.\n- Peerless world and character building\n- Inventive and varied action\n- A surprising and gripping story\n- Too much reliance on extreme violence",

            "text": "The Last of Us: Part I feels like how you remember Naughty Dog’s critically acclaimed 2013 survival horror, which is both a blessing and a bit of a curse. In many ways, this PS5 re-release blurs the lines between remake and remaster, overhauling the original in almost all areas, without tinkering with what made it so great. It means that not all of the improvements will be immediately obvious to the casual observer, but compared side-by-side with the PS3 edition and its PS4 remaster, this is undoubtedly the best version of a contemporary classic.\nThe Californian studio says the 15-hour campaign and its heart-warming Left Behind expansion have been rebuilt from the ground-up, but it’s important to contextualise what this means. The level design, save for a few minor alterations, is identical. Some interiors have been redesigned and collectibles repositioned to add more logic to the world building, but by-and-large this is an indistinguishable adventure – even down to the placement of enemies and the numbers in their ranks.\nThis doesn’t mean Naughty Dog is lying, however. The gameplay is vastly superior to the original release, with much of the motion-matching technology introduced in The Last of Us 2 integrated here. It means that there’s more freedom overall, as protagonist Joel will seamlessly transition between animations rather than stopping-and-starting like he did in the original: throwing a bottle, sprinting forward for a melee attack, and then popping off a shot looks flawless now.\nDespite this, the combat does not hit the same heights as its successor. Rather than redesign gauntlets, the developer has decided to keep combat encounters the same, meaning the dodge and prone mechanics that made the skirmishes so pulsating in the sequel are missing. Fights also feel much “smaller” in scope, owing to the limitations enforced by the original PS3 design, and therefore The Last of Us 2 is still very much the pinnacle of third-person shooters as far as we’re concerned.\nThese same constraints apply to the level design, which feels restricted a decade later. While the game certainly has its moments of freedom, the sequel was a much larger endeavour overall, allowing you to explore off the beaten path. The Last of Us: Part I’s reduced scope feels dated in comparison, with piles of debris and conveniently placed fences inexplicably locking you to a set path. It’s clear this is not how the game would be designed today.\nBut the artificial intelligence is much smarter at least. You’ll no longer brush against immersion breaking scenarios, like Ellie running directly in front of the line of sight of enemies, as everyone is much brighter overall. Aggressors will collaborate and communicate, calling out your position and working to find flanking positions – even on lower difficulties. It makes the combat that much more gratifying, and comparing it to the original is eye-opening to say the least.\nThe same is true of the extraordinary art direction overhauls. Naughty Dog has made the game less grim than its muddy and macabre predecessor, and some locations like The Capitol Building are unrecognisable in a good way. The sheer amount of detail invested into every single frame is phenomenal, comfortably putting the remake among the best-looking PS5 titles to date. All of the locations feel lived in; there’s clear thought been put into how assets are organised, meaning the environments themselves have their own stories to tell.\nSpecial mention must also be attributed to the sound, which leverages the PS5’s nifty Tempest chip to create some of the best 3D audio to date. Sony’s first-party releases tend to have tremendous mixing across the board, but The Last of Us 2 was a watershed moment for the platform holder in terms of sound design, and this remake matches up. With a quality pair of cans, you can pinpoint the position of enemies purely from their footsteps, and we actually found we didn’t need to rely on the title’s detective vision-style Listen mode anywhere near as much as in previous versions.\nAnd that’s without even speaking of the animations, which have been dramatically reworked. Cutscenes now run in realtime on the PS5, and are not pre-rendered like they were originally. This means that the transitions between gameplay and cinematics are less abrupt, and more importantly there’s a consistency to the character models throughout. Many of the most important scenes, like the heart-breaking prologue, have an intensity that simply didn’t exist in the original.\nNaughty Dog’s efforts with the DualSense should not go unnoticed either. The developer has created unique textures for almost every scenario in the game, meaning you’ll feel the rattle of shrapnel as you craft a Nail Bomb or the pitter-patter of rain as you work your way through the drizzly outskirts of Boston. It’s some of the best use of the pad’s innovative features since Astro’s Playroom, and it adds to the overall immersion of both sedate and high-intensity moments.\nIn fact, the developer’s also found ways to innovate on its award-winning accessibility with the pad’s unique features. One specific addition allows you to “feel” speech through haptic feedback, which in conjunction with the subtitles will allow deaf players to physically appreciate the way lines are delivered. There’s also full audio commentary for every cinematic in the game, taking the outfit’s commitment to accessibility to an unprecedented level.\nAnd for returning players, there’s a lot of bonus content to unlock and explore. There are artwork galleries for both the original release and its remake, and a wealth of new skins for Joel and Ellie have been added, many of which are inspired by popular PlayStation properties. For those looking for some replay value, there’s a new speedrun mode, which has been integrated into the PS5’s Activity Cards, and you can even sort through your records and best times on a chapter-by-chapter basis.\nThat said, the original’s unexpectedly popular multiplayer mode has been cut, and this isn’t a cheap proposition overall. Even with all of the improvements outlined above, £69.99/$69.99 is a tough to pill to swallow at launch, and while it’s clear an impressive amount of work has been invested into this remake, we’re yet to be convinced it justifies its eye-watering release day price point. Make no mistake, though, the campaign stands up to modern scrutiny.\nConclusion\nWithout reference to the original, it’s not always easy to appreciate The Last of Us: Part I’s impressive improvements. This is a much better game than the original, though, with stronger art direction, smoother gameplay, and much more emotional cinematics. Naughty Dog has done justice to the original by improving on it in almost every regard, but it remains the game you remember from 2013. At a more competitive price point, it’d be essential – as it is, it’s a pricey upgrade on a bona fide classic.",

            "text": "The original PS3 release of The Last of Us is arguably one of the greatest games ever made, and has managed to transcend the cultural barrier that few action-adventure games do in mainstream media, so much so that HBO is banking on one of its next big original shows on the property.\nSo, when recreating a near-decade old game from the ground up – while simultaneously trying to stay true to what made it great, it’s easy to remember the source material through rose-tinted shades and question how much of an improvement this latest remaster has made, especially when a PS4 remaster already exists – and is available for free with every PS Plus subscription (£15.99, Playstation.com).\nSo what sets the appeal of a remake, titled Part I, apart and why does US video game developer Naughty Dog see fit to charge £69.99 for it? Yes, there are some much noted improvements, as well as an entire raft of extras, but only for the most ardent flag-bearers to potentially sink their teeth into, much like the Clickers that shamble through TLOU’s ruinous yet breathtaking landscape.\nBy using the cast’s original motion capture to act as an anchor for the game’s cinematic scope, Part I is able to add new levels of detail, such as a single tear rolling down the cheek, to the glimmer of Joel’s eyes through a thousand-yard stare. But make no mistake, this is an idealised version of the original – a technical feat in itself.\nThe Last of Us is one of those controversial titles that people either love or hate for numerous reasons. Character-driven storytelling supported by tight mechanics and thoughtful environmental design contrasts with its “jarring” ending and segue into Part II’s shocking introduction. But, in our eyes, it’s still a masterpiece of the medium. Will Part I change anyone’s mind about it if they feel differently? Absolutely not.\nBut what Part I does represent is a premium package of a title that is regularly cited as an all-time great. Despite that, there’s only a handful of cases in which Part I could be recommended: if you have never played it before or you want to re-experience it off the back of The Last of Us Part II.\nHow we tested\nOur playthrough of The Last of Us Part I is based on a digital PS5 version of the game, where we were able to play through the main story as well as its additional content, Left Behind. We also used the opportunity to make use of its heavily advertised PS5 features, such as dualsense support, 3D audio and faster loading times.\nThere are also a number of accessibility features that have been added and, while we have made an effort to see how effective they are at making the game more inclusive, the reviewer does not identify as someone with a visual or hearing impairment.\n‘The Last of Us Part I’: £69.99, Playstation.com\n- Rating: 8/10\n- Platforms: PS5\n- Publisher: PlayStation Studios\n- Release date: 2 September\n- Age rating: 18+\nReview\nFrom The Last of Us’s devastating opening minutes, the graphical improvements in Part I are immediately apparent in comparison with its older versions, with detailed lighting and shading helping to capture the essence of a world on the brink of collapse.\nDespite its bleak story and setting, TLOU has always been vibrant in its presentation, but after spending enough time comparing frames side-by-side from their original cutscenes, it’s more evident how the PS3 version’s colourful backdrop was compensated by a colourful “bloom” to make its foliage stand out. Here, the overgrown backdrop is just as visually remarkable, yet it just sits on the cusp of photorealism, at least out of the foreground.\nIn detail, its more-destructive elements are more apparent. Glass shatters with force in gunfights but also crumbles with delicacy as Joel vaults a window, leaving remnants scattered underfoot with a gentle crunch that can be audibly heard as well as felt in the dualsense controller.\nPart I’s attention to detail is helped in some parts by the game’s original level design that gently funnelled players through tight spaces when compared to Part II’s open-ended segments, so it’s good to see Naughty Dog make use of that space to expand on its existing area, rather than simply enlarging it.\nWith character animations, cutscenes help to establish the improvements to facial animations. Supporting characters such as Tess, Sam, and Henry have had major changes made to their appearance while still retaining the same performances of their actors, while Ellie, as one of the protagonists, has more noticeably been redefined, aligning more with her appearance in the sequel.\nMuch like The Last of Us Part II, Part I has included a number of accessibility features. Most notably high contrast modes as well as customisable HUDs and even audio described cutscenes – supposedly a first for a videogame of this scale.\nOne of the most interesting features to be added is the ability to play dialogue through the dualsense controller, which can be used to “feel” the delivery of each line, whether it’s a sharp whisper or a sudden angry outburst. It’s quite impressive as a practical use for the PlayStation 5’s hardware, which clearly shows a lot of thought has gone into making the experience as accessible as possible for everyone.\nAs well as accessibility, the dualsense has also been put to good use with other in-game features. One particular example was being able to feel the tumblers of the game’s numerous safe locks with enough sensitivity that it could be opened successfully without looking at the screen. As you would expect from a PlayStation Studios title, it’s an excellent showcase for its own tech that can tangibly improve the experience.\nThe same can be said for 3D audio support. When playing with compatible headphones, having a surround sound experience is noticeably more beneficial and gives players a sense of the space around them. The Last of Us’s worst enemies, Stalkers, have a tendency to scuttle around and pounce on players from behind. Being able to accurately pick out their position in a pitch-black space made a lot of difference.\nIn terms of how Part I plays, the promise of improved mechanics may have left fans with the impression that it would take a page out of Part II’s book in terms of manoeuvrability, speed and brutality but the most notable changes are in its user interface and menu systems. Items are laid out in a more intuitive way and quickly swapping between items is much less cumbersome as a result.\nWhile it may seem like a missed opportunity to have Joel sprinting around, jumping prone while lighting molotovs, it does make more sense for his character (who is in his 40s at this point) to be less agile than a teenage Ellie was in Part II. His stealthy approaches, attacks and movements all carry a deliberate weight to them, which feels more appropriate.\nPart I also has a number of hidden extras that can be unlocked by collecting points for completing chapters, finding hidden collectibles and playing on higher difficulties. Some of these extras include concept art from both the original game as well as this remake, cosmetic upgrades as well as gaming commentary and even podcast episodes.\nHowever, many of these extras are unavailable to players until they are able to finish the main story. It would have been nice to access some of these “behind the scenes” features earlier on as part of the experience, as quite likely this would be many people’s third time playing this game from beginning to end.\nVerdict: ‘The Last of Us Part I’\nThe Last of Us is (and always was) a masterpiece and Part Iis unquestionably the best version of it yet, but that may not be enough for anyone hoping for a complete reinvention of the formula from the ground up.\nPart I adds just enough to warrant its remake for the latest hardware, which elevates it to the same level of The Last of Us Part II in smart design choices, flexibility and technical prowess even if it’s still the third time we’ve made this journey before.\nIf Naughty Dog’s original PS3 version was the critically acclaimed theatrical release, then Part I is the Criterion 4K remaster complete with commentary and behind-the-scenes footage.",

            "text": "The Last of Us Part I review: Is the TLOU remake worth the price?\nJust in time for the TV show, the original TLOU is back with a bang.\nThe Last of Us Part I is launching onto PS5 and PC soon, allowing fans new and old to experience the emotional story of Joel and Ellie in the highest fidelity possible. But is this remake worth playing?\nLong story short, yes, this game is worthy of your time. The Last of Us Part I brings that original TLOU game (which first launched on PS3 way back in 2013) right up to modern visual standards, enhancing the graphics in all areas - from the character models to the level of detail in the environments, everything feels significantly richer than it did back in the day.\nIf you’re the proud owner of a PlayStation 5 or a high-spec PC, we’d thoroughly recommend giving The Last of Us Part I the attention it deserves. Get the game up and running on a 4K TV or a decent gaming monitor, and we really think that you won’t regret it, even though it is priced as a full game.\nCertainly, for newcomers to the fandom that might be pulled in by the upcoming Last of Us TV show, The Last of Us Part I feels like an ideal place to start. This opening entry in the series has never looked better, and this new version feels much closer to parity with the brilliant 2020 sequel The Last of Us Part II.\nWith those newcomers in mind, it’s worth taking a minute to stress just how good the first Last of Us game is. Even without the visual upgrade, this was regarded as one of the most cinematic and emotionally charged stories that the gaming industry has ever produced.\nLeveraging the gripping story/action gameplay combo that Naughty Dog mastered in the Uncharted franchise and blending in an array of horror movie inspirations, The Last of Us takes players on a journey through the post-apocalyptic USA over roughly a year’s worth of time.\nYou mainly play as Joel (voiced in a gruff but sometimes tender style by Troy Baker), an ordinary man that has survived for 20 years since the zombie outbreak that tore his family apart and basically ruined his life.\nMore like this\nJoel finds a new lease of life when he meets Ellie (voiced with humour and heart by Ashley Johnson), a girl that needs help travelling across the ruined United States and trying to avoid an outlaw group called the Fireflies. It’s a simple setup, but it leads to an emotional rollercoaster that ranks among the greatest gaming experiences of all time.\nRead more on The Last of Us:\n- The Last of Us TV show review - why it's worth watching\n- The Last of Us TV show changes - creators talk deviations\n- The Last of Us meets The Mandalorian - Pedro Pascal on similarities\n- The Last of Us PC - when does Part 1 hit computers?\n- The Last of Us Part 1 trophies - full list to collect\n- The Last of Us Part 1 chapters - how many are there?\n- The Last of Us Part 1 safe codes - unlock all doors\n- How long is The Last of Us Part 1?

Latest on the sequel\nBy entering your details, you are agreeing to our terms and conditions and privacy policy. You can unsubscribe at any time.\nThat being said, returning fans might need to look closely to see what has actually changed here. Although the graphics look much better than they did in 2013, the structure of each gameplay section remains totally loyal to the original design.\nThis means that some playable segments feel a bit dated. For example, the tutorial area feels quite artificial, with random crates lying around to provide Joel with cover as you learn the ropes. It feels like a video game designed by an external force, rather than a living breathing world. After playing TLOU2, going back to this opening segment is a little jarring.\nIt’s worth stressing that rather than adding new story content, extra side missions, large open-world areas or anything else that you could dream up, Naughty Dog has stuck to its guns here. This version of The Last of Us is the same game that you remember - the story follows the same twists and turns, the levels have the same layouts, and the collectables are in the same places - but it looks a lot better than it did before.\nLatest deals\nSome characters look noticeably more real, for example, and the vistas you’ll visit as Joel and Ellie trek across the country are nothing short of stunning. The creative vision for the game may not have changed, but the visuals have never looked greater. And the acoustic guitar-laden soundtrack still sounds truly beautiful.\nSome fans will also notice that The Last of Us Part I makes use of the PS5’s technical upgrades, with shortened loading times and responsive triggers on the DualSense controller. You’ll also notice that background characters now all have names (a trick borrowed from TLOU2), so you’ll feel a little bit more guilty when you have to take them out.\nAll in all, this is a very faithful remake. You could argue that it feels more like a remaster, even though Naughty Dog did rebuild everything from the ground up. At the end of the day, though, this is still a wonderful game. The story still hits just as hard, and now you can enjoy it with modern-day graphics to boot. It’ll be a perfect companion to the TV show.\nThe Last of Us Part I launches Friday 2nd September for PS5.

            "text": "From a narrative perspective, there’s no real need for The Last of Us Part 2 to exist. The gripping, tightly paced, very human tale told by the first game is an almost perfect example of self-contained video game storytelling. That game’s ending—where the “hero” condemns the world to continuing disaster out of love for a companion he has slowly grown to love like a daughter, all while betraying her wishes and shielding her from the truth—is a deeply affecting and thought-provoking moment that has resonated with gamers for seven years now. The idea of adding anything to that quietly confident, freestanding narrative package feels superfluous at best and gratuitous at worst.But the difference between a happy ending and a sad one often depends on when you decide to stop telling the story. And it would admittedly be something of a waste to condemn The Last of Us’ top-notch world building to a single short game. Thus, we now have The Last of Us Part 2, a game that can't seem to decide if it wants to continue the core story of the first game or pull the camera back to provide a wider view of a fallen world still ravaged by the threat of the zombie-like Infected.\nNothing good can last\nThings pick up four years after the events of the first game in the amazingly calm settlement of Jackson, Wyoming. After the almost overwhelming death and decay of the first game, it’s a shock to be thrown into a thriving community full of electricity, commerce, gossip, food and drink, and even happily playing children. Small groups still regularly patrol the perimeter to keep the Infected at bay, but humanity, it seems, has gained a bucolic foothold.\nThe sense of a slowly returning normalcy is made all the more bittersweet because we know Ellie is fated not to enjoy it for long. The Ellie we see here is no longer the sweet, energetic, eager pre-adolescent who forged an endearing bond with gruff Joel through the first game, either. Time and knowledge have made her harder, more reserved, and more unforgiving than ever. By the time external circumstances and a drive for vengeance force her out of the comfort of Jackson and into a dangerous, murderous trek to Seattle, it’s not exactly a surprise.\nWe do get occasional glimpses of the old Ellie, especially when she’s taking her first tentative steps into a truly adult relationship. Love interest Dina is a gently teasing foil for Ellie’s developing affections here, and their extended casual banter during the trip to Seattle brings to mind some of the best bonding moments between Ellie and Joel in the last game.\nThese conversations take place amid the beautiful desolation of a city that has quickly been retaken by the nature surrounding it—a “Nature is healing” meme made vividly real. The environmental design in Part 2 is top notch, with every single location feeling like an actual, inhabited place that was fully built and then slowly left to rot. I could aimlessly wander the beautiful desolation for hours, picking out ominous touches of environmental storytelling even if I wasn’t scrounging for materials to ensure my in-game survival.",

            "text": "[Editor’s Note: The following review contains spoilers for “The Last of Us” Episode 2, “Infected.”]\nIt’s an easy shortcut to start unpacking an episode with the opening sequence and I promise that’s not going to be the case for the next two months. But it’s worth pointing out the first two cold opens in “The Last of Us” do just as much to build a sense of global unease as any overheard news report or Oval Office address or TV test pattern could. In “Infected,” the series’ second episode, the late-’60s public affairs roundtable gives way to Dr. Ibu Ratna (a magnificent Christine Hakim), a scientist and professor shown as one of the first people to recognize that humanity was in real trouble.\nIf last week’s first episode didn’t do enough to prime a viewing audience for a short supply of hope early on in “The Last of Us,” here’s an expert recognizing within minutes that nothing can be done. Dr. Ratna moves through the stages of confusion, curiosity, terror, and resignation, already grieving a society she knows is doomed. There’s something eerie about a scientist, a profession famous for considering possible alternatives and explanations, making such a definitive (and ultimately correct) statement. It’s as matter-of-fact as the presentation of the bullet hole in the factory worker on the autopsy table. This is not an environment where hope thrives.\nNot only does that opening show what’s been lost (before we get the clarification that it’s another 2003 flashback, there’s that hopeful two-second gap when it seems like civilization might somehow have survived in Indonesia), it emphasizes how much of “The Last of Us” is built on a new, unconventional flow of information. Last week’s pilot showed people tracking the trickle of symptoms before the avalanche. Later scenes in “Infected” show how even 20 years of experience still leave some gray area around the enemy that everyone is fighting. Everyone trying to stay alive is stuck in a dangerous game of Telephone, which would be hard enough even if the motives of everyone involved were pure. Ellie becomes the simplest test case for that — she’s seeing how her notions of the world beyond the wall match with reality.\nThese are abstract entry points into an episode with a fairly straightforward sequence of events. Joel, Ellie, and Tess, fresh off a hairy escape from the FEDRA-controlled quarter of Boston, now find themselves in the “outside world.” Getting Ellie to Firefly allies means traversing what’s left of eastern Massachusetts, beginning with the burnt-out remains of a city littered by decades-old bomb craters. From Joel’s telling, this is the result of a success story — conceivably, mass casualties helped stop the cordyceps spread and set up the Quarantine Zone, a process that didn’t always play out in the major cities of 2003.\nLiane Hentscher/HBO\nAs “The Last of Us” runs through the various story and design decisions facing any post-apocalyptic show, this second episode gives the audience a better idea of how things have decayed here. “When You’re Lost in Darkness” focused on the collapse and the new semblance of order in a controlled area. “Infected” is the first large-scale look at what got left behind. It’s not quite the irradiated, barren wasteland that comes after total destruction. It’s also not the frozen-in-amber, ghost town feel of something like 2021’s beautifully haunting “Anna,” where a population disappears far more gradually. “The Last of Us” takes the middle road, where the destruction is the thing most preserved, as plant life of all kinds start to take their course. Compare the damage left by man-made weapons trying to fight an unbeatable foe with the fractal-like, prismatic cordyceps growths coming from the entryway of the Bostonian Museum. The disease has more beauty to it than the cure.\nOf course, that doesn’t go for all the discoveries our trio makes. There are dead bodies inside the hotel at the mouth, the Long Way out of the city, and the museum that becomes the Short Way. Their path is littered with folks, whether smugglers or fugitives or proactive travelers, who underestimated the fungal hive mind or the renegade forces still trying to outlast them. Like the attack that plays out in the rear-view window as Tommy drives the pickup out of their Austin neighborhood, the group of Infected that Tess shows Ellie is a set of consequences seen from a great distance. Seeing this new world through Ellie’s eyes makes “Infected” something like a second half of a massive pilot. Ellie’s the newcomer/surrogate for how to process what Boston has become in this version of 2023. When she, Joel, and Tess have to wade through the waist-high water flooding what used to be a hotel lobby, it might as well be the opening level of a game getting a new player acclimated to the controls. By the time they arrive at the (fictional) Bostonian Museum, director Neil Druckmann has effectively created a tutorial level for the physical and emotional lengths our main characters can muster.\nThat also extends to the episode’s sensory experience. Score is sparse here, meaning that we’re getting used to the overriding sense of silence that will come with long stretches of Joel and Ellie’s journey. They’re away from the day-to-day hum of the QZ. The cacophony of Outbreak Day and guerrilla warfare has now given way to a world where one crunch could mean the difference between survival and Infection. Sometimes that relationship to sound is more playful (hello, new frog friend!) and sometimes it’s more instructive. (Just hearing the dead cordyceps root under the butt of Joel’s shotgun is enough to let him and us know that it doesn’t pose a threat anymore.)\nOf course, it’s at its peak in the museum room, where we get our first brush with a fully matured cordyceps Infected. This is not the kind of show where everyone spends the first season getting out of tough scrapes and close calls at the last minute. Like Tess says, her luck was bound to run out sometime. Aside from yet another example that no one in this world (outside of Joel and Ellie, at this point) is guaranteed to make it to the next episode, it makes sense that a short-handed fight against two angry opponents would only leave one of three unscathed. Tess’ acceptance of her fate is a mirror of Dr. Ratna’s.\nLiane Hentscher/HBO\nSarah’s death stood out in the pilot not just because it needed to be the thing that drives Joel to outlast his new enemy. It stood out because it was harsh and untidy and unsparing. For the second time in as many episodes, Joel is left with only a split-second chance to say goodbye to someone he cares about. His heart hardened, Joel’s history repeats and someone close to him dies without them giving words of comfort before they go.\nAnd that sense of terror transfers over to Tess, whose final moments are mostly spent worrying that her death won’t even buy Joel and Ellie the time they need. (As someone who struggles with lighters, I would almost certainly have that same combination of fear and frustration.) Her river of gasoline and hand grenades does end up eliminating the local Infected population, but this is sacrifice in the least triumphant way possible. Not only is Tess denied some last words from Joel, she has to deliver the death blow to the enemy while in the middle of an attack with its own kind of violence. Her bodily autonomy is the last thing taken away from her, and the only thing about her death that’s on her terms is the eventual outcome. Those last moments show just how much of Tess’ pain and sadness that Torv has managed to carry just in her facial expressions alone.\nPascal, too, in this episode is once again asked to do a lot with a little. If the events of the pilot hadn’t already locked him in as a lived-in, world-weary Joel, his quarter-voice instructions around the truck and inside the Independence Hall exhibit would have done the trick. Part of him not saying much is being beaten down by survival. It’s also a heavy dose of self-preservation. Fewer words give you fewer chances for strangers to suss out who you really are and fewer chances to say/not say something that you regret. From top to bottom, “Infected” is about preserving dignity in the face of almost-certain failure. Dr. Ratna just wants to be with her family. Tess finds a way to make her death mean something. Now Joel and Ellie carry on silently, trying to grow that last tiny sliver of hope.\nGrade: B+\n“The Last of Us” airs Sundays at 9 p.m. on HBO and is available to stream on HBO Max.\nSign Up: Stay on top of the latest breaking film and TV news!

            "text": "To say that I’ve been looking forward to playing The Last of Us Part II is an understatement.\nThe Last of Us is my favorite video game of the last decade. It’s an emotionally exhausting, grim, violent trek, but that despair is worth enduring to experience the beautiful, broken, post-pandemic world and the bond between its equally broken survivors, Ellie and Joel.\nEarly trailers, comments from director Neil Druckmann and an extensive preview last fall confirmed that The Last of Us Part II would be bigger, more violent and more grueling than what came before.\nNaughty Dog has proven itself to be a developer that deserves the benefit of the doubt, and I had few concerns that The Last of Us Part II would succeed on a technical level. As expected, it looks fantastic, showing just how far we’ve come from the PS3 original. Gameplay has been smoothed out and improved upon in many ways, as well.\nBut what I really care about is Ellie and Joel. The Last of Us ended with ambiguity, but nonetheless provided a stunning conclusion to a nuanced and layered story. Druckmann said that developer Naughty Dog didn’t take the decision to continue that story lightly — but after seven years of waiting, the next chapter in Ellie and Joel’s story really needed to deliver.\nA word about spoilers\nAs with most high-profile video game launches, Engadget agreed to an embargo as a requirement to get early access to The Last of Us Part II prior to its June 19th launch.\nThese embargoes come with rules — in this case, Sony has put significant restrictions on which plot points and segments of the game reviewers can discuss. As such, this article only covers the story in broad terms, and does not contain significant plot spoilers.\nThat said, if you want to go in completely fresh, you’re probably best off waiting another week and just playing the game on launch day.\nThe Last of Us Part II begins by introducing you to the town of Jackson, Wyoming, where a self-sustaining settlement is trying to build a better way of life. It’s now been 25 years since a pandemic created hordes of infected, zombie-like humans waiting to rip your throat out. (And hordes of equally dangerous human survivors.) Joel and Ellie (portrayed to perfection again by Troy Baker and Ashely Johnson) arrived in Jackson at the end of the last game following a cross-country trip to discover whether Ellie’s immunity to the infection can help save humanity -- and the first segment shows a typical day in Ellie’s life four years later.\nThis extended intro re-introduces the player to Ellie, and lets you get to know her companion / girlfriend / it’s complicated Dina. It’s also an introduction to the gameplay basics -- and it doesn’t take long to realize how differently Ellie handles compared to Joel in the original game. She’s more nimble and agile, which makes sense since she’s a stick-thin 19-year-old woman and not a strong but bulky 50-something man.\nThe main changes are Ellie’s ability to jump, lay prone, crawl and dodge. She doesn’t have the brute melee force that Joel did, but combining dodges with slashing at enemies is an effective combat technique for taking on humans or infected one-on-one. Going prone, meanwhile, lets Ellie hide under vehicles or in grass or crawl through narrow spaces. Jumping is fairly obvious but comes in extremely handy when traversing the massive, ruined city structures you encounter.\nGunplay is largely unchanged from the original game -- bullets and other ammo are scarce, particularly when you play on harder difficulty levels. You’ll need to make every shot count, and also be prepared to improvise with stealth and melee combat when you run low. You can try to sneak past swaths of enemies entirely, but it’s a lot harder to stay in stealth this time out. Human enemies are far better at tracking your location -- and some have the controversial attack dogs that can follow your scent and cause major havoc if they discover your position.\nFortunately, the many upgrade systems have been significantly enhanced, as well. As in the first game, you can craft a variety of weapons like molotov cocktails and bombs; you’ll also find “training manuals” that unlock more skills for Ellie. But the skill tree is far more complicated than the first game. There are a total of five different skill paths, covering categories like survival stealth or explosives, each with five characteristics to upgrade. Survival, for example, allows for faster health kit crafting and increased overall health, while explosives lets you craft explosive arrows or improve your molotov cocktails. There aren’t enough resources in the world to max out every skill tree on a single playthrough, so you’ll have to decide what you value most as you go.\nThere are also more items to craft than ever before -- besides returning tools like molotov cocktails and health kits, Naughty Dog added options like the aforementioned explosive arrows and a silencer to Ellie’s arsenal. You have to unlock these first through the skill tree system, and then you can craft them with supplies you find around the world. They expand the different ways you can tackle any given situation -- one of my favorite moves is making a trip mine and luring a horde of infected mindlessly to their doom. You can also craft basic arrows for your bow, which really comes in handy when other ammo is scarce. As in the first game, there’s overlap in the crafting recipes, so you’ll need to decide between, say, a silencer or a health kit to help you through an encounter.\nYou’re going to need to take advantage of everything you can, too, because this game can be extremely difficult. I played on the third of five difficulty levels, moderate, and didn’t have too tough a time. But I’ve since started to play on “hard,” and it has significantly changed the game -- supplies are incredibly scarce, and there have been plenty of times I’ve found myself with one or two bullets and no other weapons. And I’m no slouch; I beat The Last of Us on the super-difficult Grounded mode, though that was after playing through on lower levels multiple times.\nNaughty Dog does allow you to tweak individual difficulty settings for combat, stealth, resources and so forth, so if you like a challenge but want more ammo, you can set “resources” to an easier level. It’s part of an extensive accessibility effort put into the game, which is a very good thing. Players who just want to experience the story can try the “very light” difficulty, and you can adjust difficulty levels after you start the game if you feel like you’re in over your head. Meanwhile, the truly insane can try Grounded mode and a few “permadeath” options coming in a future update.\nThe visual overhaul Naughty Dog brought to the game is nearly as dramatic as the gameplay improvements. The Last of Us was a stunner for its time, but in 2020 its PS3 origins are starting to show a bit more, even when playing the remastered version for the PS4. Trees don’t look so realistic, for example, and twisting the camera to see the faces of NPCs can reveal some pretty dead-eyed expressions. In Part II, that’s not the case at all. Everything -- from faces, clothing and hair to the intricate details of signs on decaying buildings and the lush, overgrown forests of Washington -- looks amazing. Environments are similarly beautiful: Naughty Dog has a particular knack for making a brutal, broken world look like a world worth living in.\nPart II also features much larger environments and more varied gameplay than the original. The scope of The Last of Us was huge -- cities like Pittsburgh seemed to go on forever. But individual encounters with groups of enemies were pretty gated. Those areas could be large, but generally you’d clear an area and move on to another section without being able to move backwards. In Part II, though, you have incredible amounts of space to work with when dispatching roving groups of hunters or infected, which means there are untold ways to take on any situation. And you’ll absolutely need that space, because enemies are much smarter than before, better able to track you, flank you and find you when you’re in stealth. It’s significantly harder than before to stay hidden and take out a half-dozen hunters -- one mistake, and you’re spotted and in serious trouble, even with the ability to crawl through grass or hide under cars.\nThe game is still fairly linear, but there are far more ways to get through a given situation. And from an exploration standpoint, there’s tons to see that you could miss if you just stay focused on moving forward. That exploration is key both for finding items that’ll help you survive as well as adding story beats and context to the world. There’s even a pseudo-open world section in downtown Seattle where you’ll find clues that point to different locations you can explore. Most of them are entirely optional, but they’re fun to find and it was rather refreshing to do them in any order I chose. Other curveballs, like blasting away at humans and infected from the back of a truck, exploring the city by boat or even just strumming a guitar added some welcome variety to the gameplay.\nSony / Naughty Dog\nAs expected, Naughty Dog put together a highly polished game that improves on the original in a number of ways -- but what about the story? Does Part II justify going back to the well with these characters and this world? The Last of Us remains one of my favorite pieces of media, and my reaction to a sequel was equal parts trepidation and excitement. Naughty Dog’s track record ultimately made me a full-on believer, and Part II didn’t let me down in the least, even though it evoked a totally different feeling to the original.\nOne noteworthy way that feeling is conveyed is through the music. Oscar-winning composer Gustavo Santaolalla’s score for the first game was a masterpiece. There were plenty of moments where it was music purely for ambience, but there were also a number of memorable compositions that many fans see as a vital part of what made The Last of Us work. In Part II, however, Santaolalla’s music is far more understated and unsettling, or absent altogether. The first game had multiple recurring themes that help define the game, but there’s very little that is as straightforward this time.\nFrom a narrative standpoint, Part II is far more complicated and ambitious than the original, which was a fairly linear story. The sequel makes effective use of flashbacks and some dramatic changes of perspective. The end result is a story that dives deep into cycles of violence to show how there’s always someone else on the other end of your gun, no matter how righteous you may feel.\nUnless you’ve avoided every detail about Part II Naughty Dog has released, you know the basic story involves Ellie seeking revenge after her relatively tranquil life is shattered -- and throughout that quest, I almost always felt justified in my actions, rarely thinking about those on the other end of my vengeance. But like an addict, Ellie gets more and more obsessed, to the point where it jeopardizes everything she has in life. As with the first game, it’s not the most original story, but the way it unfolds is masterful, and Naughty Dog takes full advantage of the game medium to craft some truly shocking and memorable moments.\nThe Last of Us Part II shows off what Naughty Dog learned from the first game’s DLC, Left Behind as well as Uncharted: Lost Legacy. The latter game was meant to be DLC that expanded into a full game featuring side characters from the main Uncharted games, while Left Behind was less focused on combat and more on exploration and storytelling to break up the continuous darkness that is the world of The Last of Us.\nPart II uses flashbacks to fill in Ellie and Joel’s relationship following the end of the first game, and it’s both an excellent narrative tool and a much-needed bit of downtime that focuses on the ups and downs the two have been through. In an unrelentingly grim game, I keep coming back to one particular flashback that was simply joyful in a way that is unmatched in the world of The Last of Us. Another flashback later in the game is the opposite of such father-daughter love, and those two sides of the coin show everything you need to know about how Ellie feels about Joel.\nPerhaps my only main complaint is that the story slightly outstays its welcome. The game clocked in at 25-plus hours in my first playthrough, and a few times towards the end I was ready for it to finish, only to be met with more extensive missions. It almost feels like two games in one, and I found myself anxious to wrap up one story thread that was now on pause while playing through another. Of course, I plowed through the game at a pretty fast pace to finish it in time for this review; I might have felt differently if I gave it a little more time to breathe.\nThe good news is that the payoff to this meandering adventure is that much better -- once I completed the game, only some small parts of the story felt extraneous. Yes, things could have been tightened up a bit, but I don’t think any segment of the game felt out of place or like it should have been removed. It was all in service of a whole that you simply have to finish to fully grasp.\nSony / Naughty Dog\nIt took me nearly a week to start writing this article after finishing The Last of Us Part II. It’s technically exceptional, but a number of story beats and gameplay choices initially left me confused and cold. As with the first game, something this bleak isn’t necessarily “fun” in the same way an Uncharted game is. An undeniable feeling of sadness and loss permeates Part II, along with some shockingly brutal and violent moments, and it took me a long time to figure out how I felt about that.\nBut once I had processed it all, so much stood out: moments of extreme tension, moments that made me yell in shock or surprise, thought-provoking drama and even unexpected joy amidst the bleak reality of Ellie’s world. What Naughty Dog puts these characters through is oftentimes hard to experience, and if this is the last we see of them, it’s a bittersweet goodbye. But that doesn’t make the journey any less powerful, or any less worth taking.",

            "text": "The resemblance of Naughty Dog’s The Last of Us to a prestige TV or film drama has been the object of both praise and derision since its release in 2013. The game’s prioritization of its characters’ antiheroic arcs—rendered through meticulously staged motion capture—along with its episodic structure and on-rails story progression, made it possible to either laud its narrative ambition or accuse it of aspiring to be something more than a game.\nThus, some kind of adaptation to a non-interactive medium, overseen by Neil Druckmann, the game’s writer and creative director, seemed inevitable, and HBO’s The Last of Us series proves that the terms of such a debate may be false. Co-created by Druckmann and Craig Mazin (Chernobyl), this eminently faithful adaptation, despite some powerful performances, is evidence that The Last of Us is ultimately just great as a game, as the parts of it that most resemble a prestige drama grow thin when the gameplay is extracted.\nIn its broad outline, The Last of Us treads ground that already felt familiar in 2013. Joel (Pedro Pascal), a hardened middle-aged smuggler eking out a life in post-apocalyptic America, reluctantly agrees to escort a teenaged ward, Ellie (Bella Ramsay), across the zombie- and wacko-infested country to a safe location in exchange for supplies. Twenty years after the zombie apocalypse began, Ellie is the world’s new hope, the first person to anyone’s knowledge who’s resistant to the fungal Cordyceps brain infection that caused the zombie outbreak. Old contacts of Joel’s in the Boston quarantine zone contract him to deliver Ellie to the Fireflies, a partisan group looking to overthrow fascist military rule and rebuild a democratic society.\nInitially treating Ellie with the same gruff cynicism with which he greets the rest of the world, and dismissive of the hope that others see in her, Joel gradually warms to her, even caring for her as a surrogate daughter. In the second episode of the season, after the initial job to hand Ellie over to the Fireflies on the outskirts of Boston goes belly-up, he resolves to help her find her way to a medical facility in Utah. The journey there becomes a tour of the various mini-dystopias that have sprung up in the two decades since society collapsed.\nThe show’s production design takes many cues from the game, but the result is environments that can feel too manicured—the overgrowth on abandoned cars a bit too carefully placed, the moss in a patch of sunlight streaming through a collapsed roof too neatly lit, and the moments that pause on such sights a bit contrived in their attempt to aestheticize decay. The same details that can be so immersive in the game become mere window dressing for the apocalypse here.\nOn the other hand, Pascal and Ramsay succeed in breathing new life into their characters. The first episode opens with a prologue set at the outbreak of the apocalypse, in which Joel loses his daughter, Sarah (Nico Parker). The series then flashes forward two decades, and while Pascal doesn’t quite read as a fiftysomething man, he compellingly wears the weight of two decades in his troubled but soft-featured face. For her part, Ramsay imbues the 14-year-old Ellie with a nuanced combination of grown-up disillusionment and childlike naïveté that lends this The Last of Us a sense of pathos even when it’s missing most of its other marks.\nMany stretches of the game that staged memorable battles with hordes of zombies—like Elie and Joel’s run-in with Joel’s smuggling contact, Bill (Nick Offerman), outside of Boston—are reconceptualized in the terms of prestige television. Episode three abruptly cuts away from the early stages of Joel and Ellie’s journey to give us a depiction of the apocalypse as it’s been experienced by Bill, a “prepper” living alone in his idyllic and now heavily fortified burgh, even finding love in Frank (Murray Bartlett), a refugee who got caught in one of his traps. Thanks to Bartlett’s insistent charm and Offerman’s unmatched ability to make libertarian weirdos likeable, the episode’s focus on ancillary characters proves to be a highlight.\nElsewhere, The Last of Us relies far too much on material taken directly from the game, as if merely stripping back the stealth and combat elements of gameplay were sufficient to adapt it for television. The result is a series that not only often runs like a compilation of extended versions of the game’s cutscenes, but is also almost assertively middlebrow. There’s a general shirking away from horror tropes like atmospheric tension and explicit evisceration, for one thing, that renders a story about ravenous monsters rather toothless.\nTake the fifth episode, in which Joel and Ellie confront a cult of personality led by would-be authoritarian Kathleen (Melanie Lynskey) in Kansas City. Kathleen and her henchpeople feel like also-rans from your run-of-the-mill dystopia, and a final conflagration that brings them and Joel and Ellie face to face with a plethora of rampaging zombies—including one of the game’s most menacing foes—lacks the horrific release of tension it should convey, perhaps because the episode has done so little to build the undead up as objects of real dread.\nThe underwhelming confrontations with the zombies may be one crucial aspect of why this adaptation fails to accomplish the dramatic heights that the game did. The first two episodes of the series begin with explanatory prefaces that have little impact, narratively or emotionally, on what follows. And the more that the characters explain and conjecture, the less substantive the creators’ ostensibly clever rewrite of the zombie apocalypse seems. On the other hand, the series dedicates relatively little effort to truly frightening the viewer, as if being scared were somehow less important to the story than laying out its capital-T themes.\nThe experience of being frightened—of darkness, dismemberment, death, and decay—should, of course, be a major facet of this story. Without this visceral experiential quality, the series becomes a Spielbergian parable about familial crisis amid apocalyptic disaster—a late episode recreates the game’s homage to Jurassic Park’s morning-in-the-treetops sequence—that lacks Spielberg’s ability to make suspense, wonder, and sentiment truly feed into each other.\nAs The Last of Us progresses through its brutal take on the archetypical hero’s journey, its insistently grimdark vision of human nature appears more and more to be a fashionable façade. Ellie’s confrontation with David (Scott Shepherd), the leader of a cannibalistic cult, in the eighth episode provides a pair of suspenseful scenes and a showcase for Ramsay, but as it plays out here, the plotline’s trajectory is too clearly telegraphed from the outset, and the way that Shepherd’s duplicitous villain serves as a foil for Joel’s caring paternalism is too plainly laid out. In the end, by stripping out the gameplay from a vivid genre game that’s fleshed out by cinematic and televisual tropes, the series ends up as mostly just the latter: all flesh, no bones.",

It has a Metacritic score of 95, making it the joint-best PS4 game of all time by those metrics.\nHowever, the user reviews have been anything but…\nThe game gives you control of Ellie, the teenage girl you escorted across post-apocalyptic America as Joel in Part I.\nIt is set five years after the events of the first game, but the concept is much the same: defending yourself from enemies and cannibalistic attacks using a range of weapons.\nHere is what the early reviews are saying…\nIGN – 100\n“The Last of Us Part II is a masterpiece that evolves the gameplay, cinematic storytelling, and rich world design of the original in nearly every way.”\nPlayStation Universe – 100\n“The Last of Us Part II is a frankly incredible achievement. Intertwining deep, richly written characters, cementing themes of consequence and loss all the while widening a world that was so well established in the first game, Naughty Dog have crafted one of the finest action adventures of all time and one that invariably stands as the most opulent jewel of an already glittering crown of first-party PlayStation 4 exclusives.\n“A rip-roaring and emotional masterpiece that will be talked about for years to come, *this* is why more than 110 million people own a PlayStation 4.”\nThe Guardian – 100\n“This is an unlikely comparison, but now that I’ve had some time to absorb The Last of Us Part II, it reminds me thematically of Shadow of the Colossus, another game about how consuming grief and anger can be.\n“I was similarly poleaxed by that game’s clever manipulation of the player’s power, the way it also used the language of video games to make you think twice about your actions. The Last of Us Part II is another story that could only work as a game, the kind of challenging, groundbreaking work that comes along two or three times a decade.”\nScreen Rant – 100\n“The greatest game of this console generation? Of that there is absolutely no doubt. It’s also, quite possibly, the greatest video game of all time.”\nGamesRadar+ – 100\n“Naughty Dog’s PS4 swansong is an astonishing, absurdly ambitious epic that goes far and beyond what we could have imagined for a sequel to an all-time classic.”\nDigital Spy – 80\n“The Last of Us 2 is going to be divisive. Naughty Dog has made brave narrative choices for its difficult second album, which we massively respect. We would just have liked to have seen the same applied to the gameplay. It’s still solid and thrilling, and if you loved the first game, this is a must-play. It’s not as groundbreaking, but equally as heartbreaking.”\nGAMINGbible – 70\n“As a video game sequel, it ticks all the boxes of being bigger and better with more to say. But as a story, as an experience following one of the most critically acclaimed tales ever told in this medium, it sits uncomfortably on a knife’s edge, waiting for the passage of time to pull it one way or the other.”\nSo why have fans been slating the game?\nDespite being widely praised in the media, The Last of Us Part II only has an average score on 3.8/10 from users on Metacritic.\nThe negative reaction has been focused almost entirely on the story, and the choices developer Naughty Dog has made for the central characters.\nSome fans have accused Naughty Dog of “ruining the franchise”, while the level of violence has also been criticised.",

            "text": "Artbooks for games made by are some of the best video game artbooks around. My favourites are still the Uncharted artbooks. The Last of Us is good too, just different.\nThis artbook was released in June 2020, the same month The Last of Us Part II was released. It's a large format 200-page hardcover published by Dark Horse.\nThe concept art featured in this artbook is gorgeous, as you would expect from Naughty Dog. There are plenty of character designs in sketches and colours. The environment artworks are breathtaking, the composition is especially nice. The heavy mood and dark atmosphere are captured really well. The text that goes with the artworks provide brief insight to the designs and story.\nThe environment designs are kinda dark though, dark as in sometimes it's difficult to see the details. So I enjoyed the more brightly lit Santa Barbara scenes a whole lot more.

            "text": "The Last of Us Part II Review: It’s a 2020 action-adventure game developed by Naughty Dog and published by Sony Interactive Entertainment for the PlayStation 4. Set five years after The Last of Us (2013), players control 19-year-old Ellie who sets out for revenge and becomes involved in a conflict between a militia and a cult in the post-apocalyptic United States.\nThe Last of Us Part II is available from Amazon.\nThe game contains survival horror elements and is played from the third-person perspective. Players can use firearms, improvised weapons, and stealth to defend against enemies and cannibalistic creatures infected by a mutated strain of the Cordyceps fungus.\nThe Last Of Us Part II Review\nThe Last of Us 1 is one of my favorite games there is. I JUST LOVED THE CONNECTION BETWEEN ELLIE & JOEL. I loved the environment, soundtrack, and everything it had to offer.\nSo when for the first time Naughty Dog announced that they are making The Last of us: PART 2. I was HYPED and I believe everyone was super looking forward to it UNTIL the leak happened in 2020 which directly after that divided the community into 2 groups.\nSome say they will not buy it nor play it and like it while others are still looking forward to seeing how this game is gonna top the first one. Well! I was sadly one of the victims who got spoiled early before the game came and YES! I was pissed at that news BUT I kept myself open-minded and still gave this game a shot to see if maybe why they are wrong and are hating for no reason.\nWell, here we are! I have finished this game AND to be completely honest… I do not hate this game like some of the people are NOR i am in love with this game that much to give it a 10/10 sadly. I am just disappointed with how Naughty Dog went in a completely different direction. Without further due, here is my review on “ The Last of Us: Part 2 “\nThe Last Of Us Part II Review Pros:\n* Reminder that skip the point which contains “ Spoilers “ if you have not played the game yet and want to experience the game for yourself *\nGraphics / Attention to details:\n( Non-Spoilers )\nI think the graphics and the attention Naughty Dog have put on here does not need any introduction. This game is simply the best looking game of this current-generation, I am even surprised to see how this game runs on the launch PS4 and how it did not blow up.\nThe Details are simply mind-blowing. From grass growing inside buildings, outside buildings, on roads, on cars. From the small details of water drops, snow, shoot the snow, it falls, when it rains, tall grass moves when you are in it. Words can’t simply describe how amazing and incredible the number of details the Naughty Dog has put into this game and it is worth playing it yourself to see how hard work they put to make it look this amazing. This makes me excited to see how the developers will make the game look even more beautiful next-generation.\nGameplay:\n( Non-Spoiler )\nGameplay in TLOU 2 might feel the same as it was in TLOU 1 but this time there are small improvements and attention to details to it.\nThe gameplay is fun, the way the main character moves almost feels like real, the way they run, dodge, jump all feels realistic. The way the main character reacts when hit by the bullet is good ( especially with an arrow as you manually need to take it out ). There is new stuff to the gameplay this time around as well, like throwing a rope to get over an obstacle. You can prone now, you now have a dedicated JUMP button. In tl;dr again the game should be played to have the feeling of how realistic this game is ( in graphics and in gameplay )\nAnimations / Voice-acting / Motion Capture:\n( Non-Spoiler )\nAnimations in TLOU 2 are once again top-notch here. The expression that each character has impacted you on how you feel about them. The Lip-syncing in TLOU2 just spoiled all of the games for me on how amazing it was, You can see them smiling, sadness, anger, and all the emotions right on their faces as they speak. Combine that with an outstanding voice-acting from all of them makes you have the connection between those characters. Makes you feel sad when something bad happens to them and makes you happy when something good happens.\nThis type of animation combined with voice-acting connects you with the world and the game itself which a lot of games I hope does follow these steps.\nEllie with Joel and Dina:\n( Contains HEAVY Spoilers )\nTLOU 2 does one thing great and that is to make you have the same feeling as you had in TLOU 1 when you are near Joel or the new character Dina. I think by trailers and last game DLC you know that Ellie is gay. She has a love connection between Dina and that connection was done great in this game. This game does a good job actually on Positive the LGBT. I absolutely do not mind that and that was really cool to see our main character Ellie to have love to Dina\nWhat about Joel you ask? Well, this game makes you feel sad and want to cry when you see Ellie and Joel together just like they had before ( I am talking about TLOU 1 ) and cause Joel dies at the beginning and you knowing we will never see him again in the 3rd one or in the rest of this game. It still has some of those amazing connection moments that we had just like in TLOU 1. And that, I loved about this game but that love has issues as well which I will talk in cons section ?\n*First half of the game*:\n( Non-Spoilers )\nWithout spoiling anything I will simply say that the first part of the story in TLOU 2 is great and I loved it. I loved the semi-open world area we explore. I loved the connection the first half build between Ellie and someone else. Yeah! The start might have been rough BUT how the story setups from there are good, I would have rated the game an 8/10 just for the first part of the game BUT than after like 10 hours and when we reach the 2nd part… Yeah! I will talk about it below\nNew Enemies / AI:\n( Non-Spoilers )\nYes! There are new types of enemies in The Last of Us: PART 2; both in human types as well as in infected.\nNew enemies in humans are of a new faction called “ Scars “ a nickname given to extremist religious faction The Seraphites. This pack of foes often come equipped with silent weapons, like bows and arrows, and can take stealthy approaches to attack you, like hiding in the vegetation. When hit with an arrow, it can get stuck in Ellie’s skin and damage her over time if the player doesn’t remove it quickly. I loved the way they use the “ whistle signals “ to communicate with each other to hunt you down. SUCH AN AWESOME WAY TO DO IT. Another faction you fight against is the Washington Liberation Front, a militia group that takes Seattle back from the government. This faction wields guns and tools similar to Ellie, and are more direct in combat.\nNew enemies in infected are 1: “Shamblers” and they cause most serious damage ( especially in survival difficulty ), they spew an acid gas from their spores that can burn the skins. Other is 2: “ Stalkers “ and they are Stage 2 of the Cordyceps infection, Stalkers are a weird cross between Runners and Clickers. They still have some vision and are far more cautious than any other infected, working to attack you from multiple angles and hiding if you actively search for them. AND there is also a 3rd one which I will not talk about cause it appears once and is “something” else.\nWith that all, the AI this time around has been improved very much than the first game. The AI is so smart that they will try to flank you, ambush you, and communicate together to hunt you down. Naughty Dog does that system really well this time.\nThose two “beautiful” scenes:\n( Contains Spoilers )\nThere are two specific scenes that I wanted to talk about which made me cry and have the feeling of sadness that this might be the last time we see Ellie and Joel Together cause of you know and they are the flashback Dinosaurs museum as well as Ellie been what she always wanted to be an astronaut.\nThe part reminded me of a lot of some of the amazing scenes they both had in TLOU 1 as well as its DLC. Those scenes show us ( the player ) of the love between those both incredible characters and how we will be missing Joel. I always felt sad and almost cried during the scene where Joel gives Ellie a cassette of Apollo 11 where they lift off to go to space and the moon. MAN! Those scenes and that part of the game was great and I honestly wish the whole game was like that ?\nCool moments that surprised me:\n( Contains 1 small spoiler which ain’t huge )\nThere is some scene in the game where a completely unexpected happens which I loved that addiction to the game. Without spoiling all of them I will just name one. At one point you roam in a house where there is a crafting bench in which you can upgrade your weapons. If you use that you get a completely unexpected attack from someone from behind which actually scares you but also was surprised to see that. There is also another one where the game makes you feel like you have died and failed that part but then someone comes to the rescue and saves you.\nI hope many other games also have this kind of surprises and attention to details cause those were some awesome part of the game\nAccessibility:\n( Non-Spoiler )\nNot everyone can play games sadly, some might be colorblind to see a specific color or some might not even hear anything and they are still gamers in their heart so that’s why Sony and Naughty Dog have added one of the best accessibility options in any game I have seen and I have to applause them for doing it ?\nMany Accessibility includes tweaks on hearing, vision or motor, Alternative Controls which suit you well, Input Remap, NAVIGATION AND TRAVERSAL, and much much more.\nAll of the ACCESSIBILITY OPTIONS can be found by clicking here.\nThe Last Of Us Part II Review Cons:\n( HEAVY HEAVY “Spoilers” Warning )\nStory:\nSo here we go, let’s us talk about the story of the TLOU 2 and how badly and not-well executed it was with many plot-holes in it.\n1: “The Death”:\nThe Death of the main-character we had in the first one. YES! I am talking about Joel cause he dies in TLOU 2. Now don’t get me wrong, I saw it coming cause i knew that one way or another we will see Joel die cause he did what he had to be done and Ellie was our new hero of this story but the way the Naughty Dog did it was just POORLY. Let me explain to you why?\nFirst of all, I feel like Joel should have died in the 3rd game or something cause that died happened so suddenly that YES! I was sad about it but it did not shock me at all. Another thingy is of this plothole I think of which Naughty Dog either forgot about or just said… F IT, let’s do it anyway. In TLOU 1, Joel was a guy that never trusted ANYONE since his daughter died in the opening of that game. He never trusted Tess, He never trusted any military group, he did not trust Marlene and you can clearly see he did not even trust Ellie at the beginning of the game. He even knew he did a bad choice when he chose the other way in that car part of the game. He had trust issues and then SUDDENLY! He goes to the bad guy’s place in TLOU 2, casually greeds Abby and just introduces himself and Tommy in the bad guys base. WHERE THE TRUST ISSUE WENT TO HUH? From where he just trusts strangers in the cruel world where people hunt for food, water to drink??? That IMO was one BIG plothole and that stupidity made Joel killed.\nI feel like Naughty Dog could have made he died much much better and he deserves a better ending if they either developed that died scene and maybe put it halfway through the game OR killed him off in TLOU 3 as TLOU 2 would have to focus even more on Joel and Ellie development and how Ellie hates Joel cause of the ending of TLOU 1\n2: “ The New Character / 2nd Part “:\nSo with Joel Died, The story of Revenge sets up for Ellie as she sets off to find who did it and just kills THEM. Revenge stories are not bad, I mean RDR 2 did it really really well. The recent game I played; Desperados 3 ( Review of it also coming soon ) also did a revenge story well BUT TLOU 2 could have been the same IF the ending was good which sadly was not.\nWe start the first part of the game as Ellie who sets off for revenge with Dina who is a new character and Ellie loves here. The whole first part of the story was GREAT like I said. An 8/10 for the first part. BUT when we switch to ABBY for the second part of the game. I JUST HATED IT. I hated the second part of the game cause we play the character who killed Joel, I hated it cause of them resetting all the skills I worked hard for the first part and they want me to do it again, I hated it cause Naughty Dogs try to make you feel for the killer and their group like we had for Joel and Ellie which honestly I DON’T CARE. What is the point of making this whole connection of us caring for Joel and Ellie if they just force us to now care about someone who KILLED JOEL?\nI am sorry but it did not work out. I did not care at all about Abby, I did not care about there group and I just speedrun that second part of the game cause I did not care. They make us feel for them cause the second part we can interact with dogs, play with them, we can interact with horses BUT we all kill them in the first part of the game as Ellie ( another point I will talk about in a bit ). I think it would have been somewhat better if we played as Abby from the start of the game, played her for the first part which explained why she hates Joel and that that would have lead to Joel died and we start playing as Ellie for the second part… That would have made the story a bit better and I would have cared about Abby than.\n3: “ Ellie is BAD NOW? ”:\nYeah! You read that right, Naughty Dogs went a different way this time and made Ellie look like a bad guy now and Abby as good. NO! I am sorry but NO, I do not care about Abby and especially after she kills Joel.\nI mean do not get me wrong. Everyone in this game is bad. Joel was the bad cause of what he did at the end of the first game, Ellie is bad cause she just goes on the rampage of killing everyone no matter who it is just to get to, Abby is bad cause of you know. TLDR; EVERYONE IS BAD which is fine but what’s the point of making the main characters bad and out of nowhere, we should now care about a new character in this game. Why you ( Naughty Dogs ) make us feel and care about Joel and Ellie in the first game cause here you just turn completely around and made them bad. I simply did not like it and you would understand why I am talking about this when you play the game yourself.\n4: About “ THAT “ Scene:\nSo let me talk about the Abby Sex scene and how for me it felt disgusting, unnecessary and Sony breaking their own promise of what they said before.\nIt was disgusting Like I said before I have NO HATE of Abby big arms or her been muscular but when that “scene” happened, I was feeling weird cause this is the last of us… Yeah! The last of us and the first one never had sort of this feeling like I had it here. Secondly, I feel like it was unnecessary cause we never get to know him much more after it and Abby leaves him. You might say that this is for character development but i feel like even if it was for that, it could have been done in a completely different way and that would have been better than having… well, this. And other thing is that I clearly remember Sony saying that they are banning “ Sexual content “ from their games but apparently let this happened cause… IT IS ART!\nNo, Seriously; they did say that, check the link here to see for yourself:\n5: “ The Ending “:\nNow let’s talk about the ending and how I personally did not like it. So as of now, you know Joel died and Ellie is after the killer, Yeah! It is basically a revenge story and when it is about revenge than it has to end by either killing the bad guy or teaching a lesson of how revenge is bad. This game’s aim is to show you that REVENGE IS BAD but throughout the game, it feels like it is about doing revenge and when that ending happened. I was just sad about how bad it was.\nRDR 2 did a better revenge story than TLOU 2, there our hero dies when his mission is accomplished. Here Ellie’s aim is just to get Abby but she finds that Abby is stronger than her but still does not let it go. Ending of TLOU 2 could have been better IF 1: The ending had a choice of to either let you kill Abby or let her go, by this at least if many people chose to let Abby go than Neil Druckmann telling a story that he wanted would have been a success and the question of “ Did our story hit the players hard “ would have been answered OR 2: You could have ended the game at the farm place. Ellie has let go of Joel died and she is living happily with Dina ( except for Ellie having to live with those PTSD )… I would have been happy with that ending and that could have left window open for Part 3 BUT NOPE! They still wanted to show that revenge is bad and Ellie’s whole journey throughout this game was just for NOTHING.\nI am sorry to say but I did not like that ending, could have been better in many ways, and if you liked it than again! More power to you.\n6: “The Pacing / Execution / Timeline ”:\nI am gonna keep this short and simple… The way the plotline was executed and how events happened was confusing and not-so-greatly-done.\nToo many flashbacks in completely different places which confused me the main story of the game thinking “ Did that happened before this or after this or we are in that same timeline BUT in different view? “. Jumping back and forth between characters and events was just AH! Making my head hurt. Could have been done better.\nAnd that’s about it, The Last of Us: Part 2 BIGGEST ISSUE is with its story and how it was told/executed. Could have been a better game if this was all done right but sadly it did not and this caused me to not like this game a lot. TLDR; Story is a 5/10 for me while the Pacing of the game is a 2/10.\nSound issues:\n( Non-Spoiler )\nI had some sound issues with this game I don’t know if it was only me or others had it as well. The issues I had with sound were that the characters’ voice/footprints were lower than the sound of enemies and shooting. I tried changing many setting and still had not fix for it\nSo yeah! I had issues with sound mixing in The Last of Us: Part 2\nFinal Verdict:\n6/10 ( Above Average )\n( Wait for Sale )\nThe Last of Us: Part 2 is sadly a HUGE HUGE disappointment for me and it just breaks my heart seeing that this is what Neil Druckmann and Naughty Dogs decide to go with this franchise and It sadly is not the real and true Sequal we all deserve for The Last of Us 1 cause that game… That game is and will always be a masterpiece.\nDon’t get me wrong, The Last of Us: Part 2 in the technical aspect is just amazing. Graphics are beautiful to look at, Gameplay is fun with combat been intense especially on the hardest difficult cause of the rare amount of ammo you get on that difficulty, Ellie is still a great character in this one with everyone in it having an outstanding animations / Voice-acting BUT it fails deeply on the messing / not-so-great story with plotholes and execution been weak and for me personally this revenge story should have been as Part 3 and Part 2 to had more focused on the story of Last of us 1 BUT at the end story was not amazing and am disappointed on where Neil Druckmann and Naughty Dogs went with this one.\nDefinitely a game that is worth playing just only for Graphics and Gameplay so it is a ” Wait for Sale ” for me. It is available on Playstation Store for $59.99.\nThanks for reading my review on this game, YES this game is very polarizing and some might agree with me while some will not and say they LOVE it and that is absolutely fine. All different opinions are welcomed and more power to you if you liked it but sadly it was not for me. See you all on Desperados 3 / Final Fantasy 7: Remake AND Ghost of Tsusiumi.\nThe Last Of Us Part II Review Author\nThe Last of us part II review was written by CapGaming.\nHEY EVERYONE ✋.

            "text": "The Last of Us Part 2 review - a generation-defining masterpiece\n“An eye for an eye leaves the whole world blind.”\nThis adage about revenge is even truer in a world ravaged by cordyceps: a parasitic fungus that takes over human physiology, mutating people until their heads pop like corn, folding eyes under flaps of skin and growth, leaving hosts gnashing and clawing in the dark. If humanity can’t unite, these eyeless horrors will inherit the Earth.\nThe Last of Us is a character study of a smuggler and a survivor - Joel and Ellie - trekking across post-apocalyptic America. The original game opened with Joel’s daughter being killed, and he carries the guilt of being unable to save her across the US with him as emotional baggage. He offloads that baggage onto Ellie, a teenager who’s immune to the outbreak - his self-appointed surrogate daughter. By the end they share a Stockholm Syndrome-esque affection, bonded through shared trauma.\nOnce they reach the Fireflies - a group who claim they can fashion a cure from Ellie’s DNA - Joel discovers the procedure will kill her. He assaults the hospital, guns down the surgeons, and escapes with Ellie still sedated. When she wakes, he says they just ran some tests and discharged her. He lies. The Last of Us Part 2 deals with the consequences of both the killings and the lie.\nFans of the original might be concerned that forcing a story with such a perfect ending to continue would tarnish the original’s legacy. Fortunately, that isn’t the case. This is a companion piece that manages to introduce new characters and themes while also making the original story stronger simply by existing. Conversations that you’ve forgotten take on new meaning, beloved characters become more nuanced. When it ends, it imprints the same satisfaction of a story well told, packaged within Naughty Dog’s best game.\nIt opens with Joel talking to his brother, Tommy. “I saved her,” he says as the camera cuts to a bloody hospital corridor filled with bodies. Three syllables explain how Joel justifies himself. He didn’t kill them, he rescued Ellie. But he stripped away her agency, and he knows he’s no hero.\nWhere the original game opened with explosions, this prologue is more understated, poignant. It’s a story about facing the consequences of your actions, how everyone finds their inner strength in a different place, and how revenge can spiral out of control until you lose everything.\nWe play as Ellie four years on from the lie, living some semblance of a normal life in the walled town of Jackson. Joel occasionally visits her cabin to tell her dad jokes. She listens to music on a cassette player, and a lava lamp bubbles away on her desk. Sketches and posters litter the walls of her room. In Joel’s cabin, there’s woodwork tables, wooden carvings, and family photos. On his bedside table sits a pair of reading glasses and a book, An Idiot’s Guide to Space - his way of attempting to rekindle their paternal relationship. The world is stuffed with little details like this that enrich the story and reward your curiosity.\nIt is the morning after the winter dance and Ellie's getting ready for patrol. She gets her backpack, grabs her pistol, and cocks the slider with a yawn. She doesn’t curse under her breath when people get curb stomped anymore - violence is normalised, and this is just an ordinary day. Until it isn’t.\nThe main story takes place over three days, as opposed to the four seasons structure of the original. At the same time, it jumps back and forth from the past to the present, introducing characters you initially hate before making you fall in love with them. It manages to be hopeful, bleak, funny, sad, peaceful, and frightening, running the gamut of human emotion, but masterfully paced out so you’re never overwhelmed.\nEvery character is complex and human. It might be Naughty Dog’s biggest game, but it’s the studio’s leanest script - you’re trusted to understand subtext. The dialogue has an almost surgical precision to it. It also does things I’ve never seen before, in ways only video games can. It is a generation-defining masterpiece.\nThere’s a structural pattern that’s similar to other Naughty Dog games, of course. You see a landmark, you head towards it, and you have pockets of adventure along the way. There are hub-style areas where you can explore optional buildings around Seattle, but the majority of the game is linear - tailored maps with multiple routes through ruined buildings, via underground train stations, and lush, overgrown parks. There’s surprising variety to the places you visit, though, and a strong sense of discovery, awe, and exploration, despite that linearity.\nThere are tense stealth sections, huge battles, blood-curdling horror scenes, exciting chase sequences, three-way conflicts, moments of quiet exploration, and even environmental puzzles that aren’t just based on carrying ladders around.\nIt builds slowly - it is hours before you fight any humans - with relationships and character growth at the fore. You pick through buildings and see the ghost of a world that’s alien to these young survivors, scavenging for supplies, ignoring the whiteboards filled with pitch-meeting notes and profit forecasts. It earns its action and that lends it more impact as a result.\nThings ramp up in intensity as the story goes on, but it’s interspersed with those aforementioned flashbacks. These give you room to breathe when the main story is going full throttle. In one, you explore a museum with Joel and Ellie. There’s no combat, just two characters bonding as you interact with props. It’s one of my favourite sequences in a game ever, and lands harder than any virtual bullet.\nIt’s not something I expected going in, but The Last of Us Part 2 reminds me of Metal Gear Solid 5 mechanically. You spend much of the game laid prone in the grass, slithering between patrol routes. You cut through and around buildings, slip through small gaps, and hide under trucks and trains. It’s stealth that’s designed to keep you moving, to keep you reacting and improvising, to keep you clenching your jaw - and not just because you don’t want a bloater to rip it off.\nLevel design is Naughty Dog’s best, each encounter offering multiple routes and opportunities for stealth, action, and a blend of the two. You’re constantly segueing in and out of stealth as you pick off enemies with guerrilla tactics. It makes you feel like a deadly hunter one minute and timid prey the next. The AI coordinates, using vantage points and pincer tactics, flanking and flushing out: they pull you by a leg as you hide underneath a truck; they sweep buildings like a SWAT team. It’s more dynamic than the original - unpredictable and exciting.\nIn one scene, the two main enemy factions are fighting, one side standing in the flooded streets and the other in a ruined building overlooking the open space. I park my boat and crawl, fully submerged, through the knee-high water. The Seraphites, a group of religious fanatics who communicate via whistles (which are somehow more unnerving than the echo-location clicks from an infected) are winning. They’re raining down molotov cocktails on the WLF (or Wolves) below. Covered by the screams, I crawl onto a waterlogged bank, pull out my rifle, and take aim at a Seraphite through my scope. I pull the trigger and skull fragments explode from the back of his head, alerting the others.\nAs I continue picking them off, I’m distracted by nearby splashing so I pull my eye from the scope to see two of them swimming at me, one from each side. I switch to my shotgun and take one of their heads off, using the last remaining shell to rip the leg from my other attacker. From the building, I hear their allies screaming their names.\nWhen I first played The Last of Us Part 2, I misunderstood the intent behind this. Every single human in this game has a name, and soldiers call out for their fallen friends and use names in idle chatter. I thought this was to make you feel guilty for shoving a switchblade into their neck, but it’s not just that.\nNaughty Dog names the enemies in The Last of Us Part 2 as a thematic choice. This is a story of revenge, and names remind you that these aren’t faceless drones: each person you kill could leave behind a loved one who might want payback. Good and evil is a matter of perspective in a lawless world where people act on survival instinct. It’s holistic - gameplay and story in harmony. Even a minigame where you pluck at the strings of a fully functional guitar serves a purpose in the larger tale.\nEvery mechanic and story beat reinforces the themes. Combat is scrappy and messy. Incoming shots sometimes knock you onto your back where you’re free to return fire in a desperate effort. In one scene, Ellie kills someone who’s playing Hotline Miami on a PS Vita. She looks so ordinary, but she attacks you. It’s self defense. The next minute she’s bleeding out on the floor as the music from her portable console rings out. It’s fitting, because the aftermath of each battle reminded me of Dennaton Games’ indie hit.\nHotline Miami features a repeating cycle of top-down violence punctuated by a slow walk back through that carnage, over bodies and through corridors painted in blood. It wordlessly asks you to reflect on your violent deeds.\nHere that same feeling translates to a 3D, photorealistic scene. Bodies lay limp with jaws ripped from their face, teeth missing, blood spilling from the exit wound. Shoot someone with an explosive arrow indoors and a chunk of flesh might stick to the ceiling and drip down in the aftermath - a thick splash of liquid and unidentifiable body parts where a human once stood. Shoot someone in the throat and they die with a gargle, bleeding out and twitching as blood pools around them. It’s horrific, but it all works together to create a mood of unease.\nThe brilliant acting makes everything land harder. When the characters cry out, you feel it. When they say one thing and mean another, you get it. Every little facial tic, every shaking hand - Ashley Johnson, Laura Bailey, Ian Alexander, and Shannon Woodward all put in the performances of a lifetime, but even most of the side characters leave a lasting impression.\nWhen the credits rolled on The Last of Us Part 2 I was still buzzing from the excitement of the final few hours. My loyalty shifted between characters. I grew to love who I hated and dislike who I loved. I laughed, I teared up. I felt anger and elation. It’s the new high water mark for video game characters and I can’t wait for everyone to see just how special it is. As soon as it ended, I booted up New Game Plus and I’m experiencing it again with my eyes open, the context of the finished story imprinting new meaning into those early scenes and characters. I’m not swiping in the dark anymore.\nVersion tested: PS4 Pro - a review copy was provided by Sony.",

            "text": "“All I ask is that fans of the first one put faith in us and trust us. We’re going to do right by you.”\nWhen it was announced by Naughty Dog that they were making a sequel to The Last of Us, considered by many to be one of the greatest games of all-time, Creative Director Neil Druckmann offered the above quote. After spending over 35 hours on my initial playthrough, I spent the following couple of days reflecting on the game before sitting down to write this review. So in the end, did Druckmann and the team at Naughty Dog do right by fans? Yes….and no.\nThe Last of Us is one of my favorite games of all-time and I feel a deep connection to Joel and Ellie. I wrote a retrospective a few years ago to highlight the significance of the story and the game’s importance to the industry. There’s so much I want to touch on in The Last of Us 2 in the same vein, but as this is solely a review, I will be focusing on the game from a more critical perspective and save my deep dive for a future article (though this will be a long review).\nNote, to properly review this game you simply must talk about the story in my opinion. Thus, only proceed if you have finished the game or don’t mind spoilers. Also, I would be remiss to not mention the wealth of game and accessibility options delivered with this game. Naughty Dog deserves a large amount of praise for that focus and I hope that more developers take note.\nTo set the stage, it’s 5 years after the first game and Joel and Ellie now live in a settlement called Jackson. Early on you are given a glimpse of the now strained relationship between the two, but are not treated to why until much later. As part of the residents’ responsibilities, groups are sent on patrols and so, after some new character introductions, you take the role of Ellie and head out on patrol.\nNoticeable from the start, Naughty Dog has once again crafted an extremely beautiful world. At times, it’s honestly hard to believe it’s running on PlayStation 4 hardware given its age. Environmental details are simply gorgeous at times and the lighting engine has a way of subtly bringing things to life in a way that’s difficult to describe but beautiful to witness. This is especially true in the later levels where I was far too often jumping in and out of photo mode.\nI did run into a few visual bugs at times however. Depending on the angle I was using in cover, sometime enemies or objects would clip and thus go from being visible to invisible repeatedly. There’s also a noticeable disparity at times in some of the locations. One moment you’ll be gasping in awe at the beauty of what’s presented to you on-screen but at other times, you would swear you were playing The Last of Us Remastered. None of this truly detracted from the experience, but I feel it needs to be mentioned.\nThe combat and crafting systems from the first game will feel very familiar here, though Naughty Dog has improved them in a few ways. Training manuals are found as you progress and unlock short, linear skill trees that focus on specific attributes. Thus you can further fine tune your approach to the game depending on what your priorities are. Meanwhile combat feels largely similar to the first game, but the added nuances to the mechanics give you the freedom to approach situations in more ways. The ability to go prone to sneak closer to enemies is great for players like me who keep it quiet. Or if you’re more of a guns blazing type of player, you’ll be right at home with chained attacks, limb specific targeting, and some truly impactful melee animations and attacks. My only complaint really is with the aiming system which continues to need fine tuning. If you’re used to playing more polished shooters, The Last of Us 2 can feel a bit clunky at times.\nThe new movement abilities for traversal are reflected greatly in the game’s level design. Let me be clear; this is a far larger game than the original. To fully engross yourself in the world, find the collectibles, and uncover the backstories of the residents presented throughout, you’ll spend a lot of time exploring. And many of the small areas to find collectibles, workbenches, and safes are hidden in rooms you’ll have to get creative to find. I personally enjoyed this aspect of the game’s design and I applaud Naughty Dog for spending more time on it in the sequel to make it feel less on rails.\nAn area where I wish they spent more time however, is in the A.I. Not only do the human enemies in the game seemingly share the same lobotomy doctor, but you spend a large amount of time with an A.I. companion throughout the journey and they can be infuriating. Only occasionally do they have a meaningful impact on battle. Far more often than not, they will get in your way, push you out of cover, and block your line of sight. Given the size of the environments and the space in which to move, why the companions are programmed to want to cover directly next to you so often is mind-boggling and it honestly ruined some of the battle scenarios for me.\nThe Last of Us 2 is not just a larger game than the original, it’s a far longer game. This is due to the story’s setup and some very extensive character development. And just like the first game, those are the meat and potatoes of the game. Though, unlike the first game, they don’t taste quite as good.\nAfter your brief time getting re-acquainted to Ellie you are introduced to Abby who is the leader of a group searching for someone in Jackson. After an intense escape from the infected thanks to Joel and Tommy, Abby escapes with them to Abby’s group’s cabin. And if you’re reading this, you know what happens next. As someone who managed to avoid all spoilers leading up to the game and had been on blackout for months, the torture and murder of Joel came as quite a shock and really hit me hard. Of course this sets up Ellie’s mantra of revenge and the journey to Seattle.\nThe majority of Ellie’s journey to Seattle is spent with Dina and Jesse, but the various flashbacks to prior years with Joel were some of my favorite moments in the game. In my opinion, that’s why we’re here; for Joel and Ellie. In particular, the chapter spent at the museum will sit with me for a very long time and is one of my favorite moments in gaming from this generation.\nWhere Naughty Dog chose to go next however, is where I really struggle with my thoughts on the game as a whole. Taking Ellie on a journey of revenge seems like the obvious route, and given the size of the world and the accompanying characters in Tommy, Dina, and Jesse, a sequel in that vein could have been a spectacular follow up. In fact, that’s how the game was marketed. Instead, we later take the role of Abby and spend a large percentage of the game playing through her history and experience. This narrative decision by Naughty Dog is where I believe the game excels to a level very few developers can reach while simultaneously being somewhat of a disservice to fans and the IP.\nJoel and Ellie are beloved characters for fans. Given there only being a single game in the franchise that is now 7 years old, it’s a testament to the quality of the original game and its character development. To kill Joel off early in the sequel was already a bold choice. But to then put the player in the shoes of his murderer, for whom we only have disdain, was a huge leap.\nWe then spend nearly half the game playing as Abby to build out her history and psyche thus showing the parallels of trauma in her life with Ellie’s. In that vein, the game does a masterful Tarantino-like job of giving players the underlying context and subtleties of Ellie and Abby’s mindsets. But the questions I asked myself over the many hours playing as Abby were “Do I care about this? Do I care about Abby?“. Worse yet, I certainly didn’t care about her friends with whom you spend a substantial amount of time with in both gameplay and cinematics.\nThis is further compounded by pacing issues for periods of time where it feels as though you are playing through filler which isn’t necessarily needed though I understand it from a character journey perspective. I couldn’t help but feel like I had been Halo 5’d all over again where I went into a major big-budget sequel expecting to play as one of my favorite characters, only to be forced into playing with someone I had no connection with due to the writers wanting to fill a specific plot.\nLate in the game as Abby, you have to battle Ellie in the theater which is one of the most meaningful moments in the game. Beyond the obvious reasons why, as a player it showed me where my allegiances lied and speaks to the issue I had with the game’s direction. I simply didn’t want to hurt Ellie. And when I did, and the cut scene ensued, I felt bad about it. The game had taken me on a path I simply didn’t want to go. Forcing players to question their allegiances isn’t necessarily a bad thing and again I applaud Naughty Dog for pushing the boundaries of expectations. But as the old adage states: just because you can, doesn’t mean you should.\nRegardless of my opinions on the direction, the way in which the story is told is in typical Naughty Dog fashion, brilliant. The cinematics are some of the best ever developed in a game and the fidelity with which they are displayed enables the game for you to relate to the characters as you would a show or movie. They can be enormously impactful and by time you reach the game’s epic final battle and ending scenes, you will be hard pressed to not be emotional.\nAs with the original, few games have made me feel the way The Last of Us 2 has. I continue to reflect on specific elements, and my friends and I have already had long discussions about the plot points and decisions made by the characters as if they were real people. The nuance shown in tackling such subjects as loss, revenge, hatred, regret, and at the heart of it all, our humanity are profound. And the fact that it makes you question and analyze both the characters and even yourself is inspiring. More than anything, I believe that speaks to the quality of what Naughty Dog delivered with this game. Very few developers can accomplish what they have and despite my complaints, it is still a monumental achievement in storytelling.\nAs a reviewer, the question I ask myself is this: Do the achievements in storytelling, narrative, and cinematics completely outweigh the issues with pacing and gameplay elements? In a way they do as they are so far above the bar, they have little to no competition. But I can’t overlook them entirely. Seasoned Gaming’s definition of a 10 is not perfect but rather “Historic”. If I were to rate the original title today, it would be only the third game ever to receive a 10 from this outlet.\nBut I don’t believe The Last of Us 2 achieves that same significance and I certainly don’t believe that Abby will be remembered in the same vein as Joel and Ellie. In the end, this is a journey I highly recommend everyone taking and I hope other developers take note as to what can be achieved with storytelling in video games. But I’d be lying if I said I haven’t questioned the game’s direction frequently since completing it.\nWith that, I end as I began. Does the game do right by fans? Yes…and no.",

            "text": "Making a big budget, ultra-violent video game about the harmful consequences of violence is a bold move. It can be difficult to convey nuance and subtext when your photo realistic world is awash with the virtual entrails of vanquished enemies and your player character’s clothes have turned crimson with other people’s blood. In this respect, The Last of Us Part II doesn’t so much have its cake and eat it as smear the confection around its face and dare you to disapprove.\nIf the 2013 original was, at heart, a story about unconditional parental love and the sacrifices we’re willing to make for our children then this equally powerful sequel looks at the reverse of the coin, hate, and asks the question: if vengeance is pursued at all costs, what happens to those who end up paying the price?\nIt’s practically impossible to go into specifics without stumbling into spoiler territory and The Last of Us Part II is very much an experience enriched by entering with as little advance knowledge as possible. Suffice it to say that something very bad indeed happens to returning heroine Ellie at the outset, triggering a gripping 25-hour descent into the heart of darkness (or rain-lashed Seattle as it’s also known) which is every inch the equal of Conrad and Coppola’s work in their respective media.\nThe crucial difference here, of course, is agency. The victims of Ellie’s murderous odyssey die by your hand as well as hers, and developers Naughty Dog employ an impressive suite of mechanics to ensure you, the player, is aware of the blood on your thumbsticks. These vary in size and scale, from rank and file enemies referring to each other by name to reinforce their humanity, up to some genuinely unsettling set piece stunts which recall similarly genre-defining moments from games like Bioshock and SpecOps: The Line.\nWhere Naughty Dog themselves sometimes stumble is the sheer volume of viscera players are forced to endure. Combat in The Last of Us Part II is beyond brutal; it’s violent to the point of viciousness, and so graphic as to risk being gratuitous. Director Neil Druckmann will argue - and, indeed has - that this level of realism is necessary to drive home the consequences of the player’s actions, and also the game’s stealth mechanics make most of the murders optional anyway.\nThe defence only holds so much water. The game’s camera occasionally lingers on the gore a little too lovingly, giving the impression of a voyeur rather than a documenter. And while the game’s stealth elements are much improved - this is by some distance Naughty Dog’s most impressive implementation of combat to date - the armies of enemies Ellie must pick her way through often makes bloodshed inevitable. Indeed, some of the encounters in the closing couple of hours feel more suited to the same studio's Uncharted series than this one.\nCombat is only half the story here, though, and The Last of Us Part II’s actual storytelling is exceptional, expanding on the narrative tricks and techniques explored in the first game and honed in its subsequent slice of sumptuous downloadable content, Left Behind. The most memorable moments of that add-on were arguably those in which nothing much actually happened at all, and similarly this sequel often shines brightest when it's most mundane: the times Ellie passes chit chatting with her companions while picking through the rubble of our ruined society; or the often delightful flashback sequences designed to flesh out the main cast’s characters and motivations rather than flay the flesh from their foes.\nNaughty Dog are masters of mood but for all the intensity they generate - and a significant chunk of Part II plays like a full-on horror title - one of the most memorable levels here is the initial introduction to downtown Seattle, a sprawling exploratory experience which owes much to the Madagascan open world experiments of Uncharted 4.\nNone of this would be believable - or even possible - without the world class world-building, animation and performances pulled together by what is now inarguably one of the industry’s elite tier development houses. Troubling allegations surfaced earlier this year about Naughty Dog’s demanding working practices but, whether healthy or not, that obsession with perfection permeates every pixel here. Just as The Last of Us served as a high watermark for the previous console generation, so its sequel does for this.\nIn fact, Last of Us Part II might even surpass the achievements of its predecessor. For while it inevitably lacks that first game’s shock of the new, it instead trades on the player’s familiarity with its characters and their backstories to take them somewhere equally unexpected. And while it may lose its focus a little in the penultimate reels, Last of Us II eventually lands an emotional punch that will be felt long after the credits roll.\n- The Last of Us Part 2 is available now for Playstation 4 from Game.",

            "text": "Ten years on, the original The Last of Us is still regarded as a transformative game. When I first played it, aged 13, it blew me away. I had never played anything so gritty and realistic, with a narrative that was as good as premier TV shows. But after finishing the PS5 remake of The Last of Us Part 1, I have had yet another transformative experience that represents just how far games have come in nine years.\nWhile the whole game has seen two generations of visual upgrades, the most striking and also the most subtle is the environmental upgrades all around you. Simply put, Naughty Dog has been able to pack so much more into every single location you visit.\nI played through the whole game whilst using a video guide for the original game to snap up all the collectibles. And by doing that, I got a one-to-one comparison of every location in the game and consistently found myself stunned at what Naughty Dog has done on PS5.\nBill’s Town and Pittsburg are now far more overgrown with flora wrapping around buildings to a greater degree and covering the ground in vast swathes. What once was just roads with overgrown plants around them, is now an entangled web where the moss, weeds, and grass overlap and interweave with the roads, cars, and buildings creating a dense and vibrant contrast between the old world and the new one.\nThe aesthetic of the environments in the game better aligns with The Last of Us Part 2 and features a more green and natural tone than the orange and brown that was plastered all over the original game, almost like a filter. Indoor environments like the Pittsburgh checkpoint have been significantly upgraded.\nWhat once was a wooden wall behind a cafe sign in this location now has an inscribed picture printed onto it, giving the environment a more realistic look like people used the space before society fell.\nWalls, shopfronts, building interiors, and practically any other environment you can think of have seen a huge visual enhancement, with the materials and textures of them better reflecting the real world. Colours pop as you explore the Mall in Left Behind and darkness dims sections of the sewers and hotel basement giving them a whole new atmosphere.\nLooking back you can see just how much the technology restricted what Naughty Dog could do and as I revisited location after location I was captivated by just how different the various sections of the game are in this remake. This all gives The Last of Us Part 1 a refreshing sense of immersion and a heightened post-apocalyptic feel that, while it might be cliche to say, really makes it feel like a brand-new game.\nThe core of my love for the original game came from the story and the survival third-person action gameplay. While the setting was haunting because of the Clickers, you never really felt scared at what might be around the corner or the sounds you heard in the distance.\nBut, that extra realism added with this remake adds a whole new dimension to experiencing The Last of Us, even if you have already played it before.\nThe 3D Audio really amplifies that as well, as it allows you to hear enemies screech well before you see them, and the feeling of being ambushed by Stalkers who are behind you or lurking in the shadows is blood-curdling.\nSimilarly, Joel’s desperation, reflected in the DualSense controller during an intense brawl with multiple enemies, adds an extra kick to the feeling of intense survival that runs right through The Last of Us. This is done through the click of a shotgun as you panic pump the barrel or reload, the subtle breaths of Joel struggling as he fights, or the rumble of the controller as you and your enemy are thrown around as you trade blows.\nSmaller details like the rumble of the DualSense when the armoured truck rolls by and shakes the ground or the light trigger pulls and resistance differentiating each weapon give the whole game a greater sense of reflecting the real world. Objects feel physical, weighty, and look like they do in the real world.\nSystems like the new workbench and revamped collectible menu, which are ported over from The Last of Us Part 2 give you that close-up of items in the world and help remove the idea that the pistol is a videogame gun or the document is just a collectible.\nAdditional improvements to the enemy AI also modernise the gameplay experience of Joel and Ellie’s adventure across the United States. Enemies are now far smarter and more sophisticated. This leads to the game no longer feeling like a shooting gallery at times, as you take down enemies one by one with genuine stealth to progress to the next area.\nHumans will double back, hone in on your position, look around desperately if one of them stumbles upon a dead friend, and generally surprise you by diverting off paths that were set in stone in the original release.\nIn a lot of ways the game plays like The Last of Us Part 2, but you still retain that more restricted, bulky feeling as Joel, which offers a different flavour to Ellie’s heightened manoeuvrability.\nThese improvements, the general upgrades to the facial animations when Runners or humans are shot, as well as the improved visuals during cinematics, all help to bring The Last of Us Part 1 into the modern day while you are playing.\nThe core experience and everything that made The Last of Us Part 1 great remains untouched, with some fun extra modes and unlockables for you to earn. But, after playing The Last of Us Part 1 and seeing the upgrades and enhancements in action I can see why it was remade.\nEverything here from the gameplay improvements with the DualSense and AI to the completely overhauled environments all amplifies the emotions, feelings, and themes Naughty Dog was trying to convey with the original game in 2013.\nIt’s rare a remake feels truly transformational for a game, let alone a game that is less than ten years old, but The Last of Us Part 1 is the exception. These changes all make the game feel less like you are playing through levels and instead like going on a journey or reading a book from cover to cover.\nAnd while Joel and Ellie take you along for the ride in this remake, you’ll also get to experience your own little journey too – and that one illustrates just how far games have come in such little time.\nThe Last of Us Part 1 (PS5)\nThe Last of Us Part 1 is a truly stunning remake that significantly heightens the immersion of one of the best games ever made with denser environments, more realistic gameplay, and beautiful remastered visuals.",

            "text": "The first time I played The Last of Us, I thought I was done playing video games. As the credits rolled on Joel and Ellie’s story, I realized I had never played a game quite like this before, like I had seen the pinnacle of what video games as a storytelling medium could be. As I sat in shock of the events in the game’s third act, I couldn’t fathom playing another game. What other game could move me this way? What video game could give me this type of experience again? Had Naughty Dog finally made the game that narratively, for me, simply couldn’t be beaten by any other game? Had the team who once made Crash Bandicoot ruined games for me forever?\nAlmost a decade later, Naughty Dog has released The Last of Us Part I, the second remaster of this already iconic game—a reminder that after all these years, nothing has been released since that comes close to the emotional impact and powerful story that was crafted with Joel and Ellie’s journey. Playing The Last of Us Part I on the PlayStation 5, it becomes even more abundantly clear that this is one of the best games of the last decade, and therefore, one of the greatest games ever made.\nBut if you play video games, you almost certainly already know that. You probably played The Last of Us when it first made a splash on the PlayStation 3 in 2013, or maybe played the first remaster, The Last of Us Remastered, released on the PlayStation 4 a little over a year later. If you’re reading this, you’re probably not wondering if The Last of Us is a masterpiece, you’re probably wondering if a new version of a game originally released during the Obama administration is worth spending $70 on. Simply put, if you’ve never played The Last of Us, there is no better time to experience one of the most impressive narratives in video game history. And if you’ve already played The Last of Us, well, one of the greatest games of all time is now better than ever—and that’s reason enough to shell out $70 for this adventure once again.\nThe Powerful Story of Joel and Ellie\nFor those new to this series, The Last of Us takes place in a ravaged world full of creatures known as the Infected. We see this world through the eyes of Joel, a man who lost his only daughter during the first outbreak, and twenty years later, has become a rough, closed-off smuggler just trying to get by. When he’s tasked with smuggling a teenage girl, Ellie, to a rebel militia group known as the Fireflies, Joel starts to slowly but surely that there might be something in his life worth fighting for once more.\nThe Last of Us was always about the tremendous performances of Troy Baker and Ashley Johnson, who play Joel and Ellie, respectfully, and the latest enhancement in this version highlights these roles even more. In this cross-country trek, I found myself time and time again lost in the eyes of these characters. Even more than my previous times playing through this game, I could see the frustration and exhaustion in Joel’s eyes, the worry and uncertainty in Ellie’s eyes, and how this development only made these already great performances even better. But it’s noticeable elsewhere throughout the game, as when Joel sneaks up on an enemy and chokes them, we can see the life leaving their eyes, or when Henry (Brandon Scott), one of the characters Joel and Ellie meet on their journey, has a moment of true heartbreaking panic, that unbridled fear can be felt through the eyes. And yes, The Last of Us Part I is graphically impressive and far closer to the visuals of The Last of Us Part II than the previous iterations of this game, but for me, this story is all about those performances, and in that aspect, I felt the significant changes Naughty Dog has brought to this story.\nBut the core of what makes The Last of Us and the included DLC, Left Behind, so powerful is the story. On paper, The Last of Us is a fairly standard post-apocalyptic story that we’ve seen before. Even the weary adult trying to protect a child through this new world has been done in stories like The Road and The Walking Dead. Yet that’s what makes The Last of Us such a remarkable experience: this is a tried and true story, but in the form of a video game that puts the player in control of these characters, this narrative has an even greater impact. We can watch Joel and Ellie grow closer to each other, slowly lowering their barriers until they are open with each other in a relationship both of these characters desperately needed. This isn’t just shown through cutscenes and larger story moments, but in the very gameplay itself. The way these characters interact shifts depending on where the relationship is at the time. How Joel and Ellie interact with this world and each other feels natural and evolves beautifully as the months pass. In The Last of Us, this isn’t a passive narrative that we’re watching unfold, we’re active participants in watching this care and compassion for one another grow, and it’s a beautiful thing to behold.\nThe Last of Us Part 1 Improvements\nNot only is this game more beautiful than it ever has been before, having been rebuilt for modern consoles, it also allows for more ways to play this story. One of the biggest additions is an incredible amount of accessibility options that will allow a much larger audience to finally experience this game. In addition to even more unlockable options, like new outfits and filters for the game, The Last of Us Part I now includes two new modes that will allow for even more ways to play through this fungus-ravaged world. A new speedrun mode will let players fly through this tale as fast as they possibly can (although who wouldn’t want to stop and soak up this story and pet a giraffe along the way), while a permanent death mode puts even greater importance on the survival of these two characters. Plus, playing the game with the PlayStation 5’s DualSense controller makes the player feel the power of every bullet, every arrow, and every struggle that this pair has to face as they cross the United States.\nBut the pre-release discussion of The Last of Us Part I always tends to come back to whether or not this version is a cash grab, just an excuse to release a nine-year-old game with better graphics under a $70 price tag. Playing through this game that I’ve played multiple times at this point, The Last of Us Part I reminded me of a great film that gets updated based on the current technology. We don’t complain when a new remastered version of The Godfather comes out every few years, improving an existing masterpiece to be better than it ever has been before, and the same thing should be true for The Last of Us Part I. With a classic movie, the film can only look better, but with The Last of Us Part I, performances are improved, the world looks richer and more alive, and the already impeccable gameplay feels as fitting as ever. With The Last of Us Part I, Naughty Dog has taken an already classic video game and made it even more impactful and powerful than ever, a great experience made greater for years to come.\nSimply put, The Last of Us Part I is one of gaming’s greatest stories heightened by modern technology in a way that simply wouldn’t have been possible a few years ago. There’s never been a better time for newcomers to experience this world, and even for those who have played this game multiple times like myself, this world has never felt this magnificent, brilliant, touching story that is better than ever before.\nRating: A+\nThe Last of Us Part I comes to PlayStation 5 on September 2, and a PC version is in development.",

            "text": "It’s been less than a decade since The Last of Us originally launched exclusively on PlayStation 3, and we’re now already getting a remake. Painstakingly rebuilt for Sony’s flashy PS5, and with a PC release also in the works, The Last of Us Part I is the perfect entry point for those who have never experienced this brutal classic, while also giving diehard fans a decent excuse to double or triple dip.\nSo, what are players getting for that divisive £70 asking price? The Last of Us Part I packs in the original game, as well as the Left Behind story DLC and some all-new bonus features and content. The fantastic Factions multiplayer mode is missing, but that’s for obvious reasons. Not only is Naughty Dog preparing to show more of its new TLOU online experience, the PS4 servers for The Last of Us Remastered are still live and well populated, even to this day.\nIf you’re dropping money on The Last of Us Part I hoping for completely new levels and cutscenes, you’ll be left sorely disappointed. Content-wise, it’s almost exactly the same as the original game and its DLC, albeit having undergone a masterful makeover. There are some fun extras there too though, including speed-running and permadeath modes, as well as an advanced suite of accessibility options that take a few steps beyond those found in The Last of Us Part II, and DualSense haptics.\nSeeing this game in motion, the difference here is truly night and day compared to previous iterations. When Naughty Dog officially unveiled this project, director Neil Druckmann said it had allowed the studio to realise the original vision they had for The Last of Us, unburdened by the limits of legacy hardware. It really shows. From that very first frame, the amount of passion and technical prowess that’s gone into this remake is astoundingly apparent. From the way tiny cordyceps particles dance in the light, to the individual grey hairs and wrinkles adorning Joel’s gorgeous mug, the level of detail here is staggering.\nIn case you wanted further proof that this is a remake and not a remaster of a remaster, just look at some cutscene footage. Naughty Dog has gone back and analysed performance capture for the original game from a decade ago, leveraging the power of PS5 to create more lifelike facial animations. The game’s cast of characters become all that more compelling and believable, their interactions carrying more weight and emotion with every subtle eye movement or subtle gesture. It’s truly uncanny stuff.\nThe backdrop upon which their gritty post-apocalyptic saga takes place is equally as impressive. Again, Naughty Dog has rebuilt these environments with the benefit of modern hardware; from suffocating, fungi-infested sewers to busy streets and snow-covered forests, The Last of Us Part I is hardly lacking in visual variety, either. Another impressive detail is the enhanced destructibility with surfaces chipping and breaking apart under fire, dialling up that sense of immersion to 11.\nSaying that the gameplay has been completely overhauled would be grossly misleading. Without playing them side by side, you’d swear Part I feels exactly the same as the original, albeit slightly smoother. Don’t go expecting Joel to jump and crawl like Ellie does in The Last of Us Part II. If there’s three things he hates it’s jumping, crawling, and golf. Jokes aside, while playing this remake we never felt like these additional mechanics were needed, though it does inherit something else from its sequel.\nWe get to see the same dynamic AI controlling the minds of enemy and ally NPCs alike, naturally dancing between cover while trying to outmanoeuvre one another. Maybe it’s more of a testament to how well designed TLOU’s combat has always been, but we played the same skirmish in both the PS4 remaster and remake with dramatically different results. Oh, that’s another thing passed on from Part II: the option to boot up and replay your favourite encounters from the main menu. There are other touches too, such as the improved weapon upgrade workbench.\nThe majority of changes here still feel cosmetic, though they amount to one of the best-executed video game makeovers we’ve seen to date. As someone who feels an increasing need to shotgun playthroughs beneath the pressure of an ever-growing backlog, I spent a hefty chunk of my time absorbed in Part I’s photo mode. There’s a good spread of tools here, perfect for capturing the game’s gorgeous overgrown vistas or moments of bloody carnage. While not quite as good as the photo mode in Days Gone, it has a brilliant frame forward feature, meaning you don’t have to be quite so precise with timing snapshots. Expect your social media feeds to be chock full of photos from The Last of Us for the next few weeks.\nModernisation can be tough in video games, especially when venturing into the realm of the remake. It requires a careful balancing act that could easily end in a developer going too far, plastering over a game’s flawless foundations or stripping it of its soul. With The Last of Us Part I, Naughty Dog knew exactly when to apply the brakes, retaining the frantic feel of its combat and survival mechanics while dramatically improving every other aspect of this PlayStation classic. Thanks to the remake, it’s just as essential today as was back when The Last of Us made its game-changing debut.",

            "text": "The Last of Us: Part 2 Blind Accessibility\nAs much as people had hyped this game up before launch, I've always maintained that it's one thing to see demos of a game's accessibility and another to play the title for yourself and utilise those features in person. I'm very glad to see that the hype was just as valid as I thought it would be when I saw the initial press coverage, with Naughty Dog putting a massive amount of effort into making sure everything works as intended.Whilst no game is perfect, especially in terms of accessibility for gamers without sight, The Last of Us 2 is a testament to what can be achieved when accessibility is considered from the ground up and is extremely close to being flawless. I only hope that both platform developers and teams working on updates to current titles and future projects take this for what it is: an example to push the industry forward to new heights and a bar to work from. I have thoroughly enjoyed my time with this game and can't wait to see what innovations arise from this title going forward.\nScore9.5 out of 10\nIntroduction\nI’ve started off recent reviews saying how I’ve not played certain games like Final Fantasy VII or Minecraft. In that sense, this review is no exception: I’ve never played The Last Of Us. Despite its critical acclaim, its emotional weight means that I wouldn’t want to necessarily put an unsuspecting player through the journey unless absolutely necessary. Additionally, its reliance on stealth and survival, as opposed to more action-oriented gameplay didn’t seem like an easy sell to potential CoPilots.\nThat doesn’t mean I won’t ever play the original game, just that I’ve had to work with commentary on YouTube and streams on Mixer and Twitch for my understanding of the first game’s plot.\nHowever, when The Verge released an article talking about accessibility features in The Last Of Us 2, I was both shocked and extremely pleased. Pleased as having so many accessibility options allows so many more people to enjoy the experience and shocked because it was the first title I’m aware of to promise 100% accessibility to “blind” players, including the possibility of obtaining the platinum trophy and completing The Last of Us 2 start to finish without sighted assistance.\nFirst Boot\nOn first booting The Last of Us 2, there is no speech at all and text to speech is not enabled. To achieve this, press down once on the DPad and you’ll hear your very first spoken words of the prompt system. After turning on the TTS with the right arrow on the DPad, you can then navigate around freely to select your prefered language. Changing this also changes the language spoken by the custom TTS in-game).\nAfter pressing continue and adjusting the markers for the edges of the screen, you are then presented with what would be considered the main accessibility setup screen, allowing you to turn on one of the 3 presets for Vision, Motor or Hearing. As you continue to progress through these screens you are able to customise even more options and, eventually, you’ll reach the main menu with “Story”, “Options”, and “Extras”.\nGoing into the options menu allows you to take stock of the full range of accessibility settings available in The Last of Us 2 and adjust to your heart’s content. With this many options, it might be a little complicated at first but the fact that the game’s cursor remembers your previous position in the options menu structure certainly can be useful.\nDon’t worry if you don’t know what all the options do. With over 60 there is a massive amount of combinations, and sometimes you won’t know what works for you until you need to resolve a specific sticking point during a playthrough.\nSo What’s Narrated?\nThe menu narration in The Last of Us 2 is, in a word, fantastic. Everything including button prompts is narrated, including tutorials. While the speed is not adjustable, it is fast enough that it hasn’t personally been a problem for me, even in intense combat situations. There are even elements that I didn’t expect to see read that in fact do, which is a great and welcome surprise.\nThe Audio Cue Glossary\nOne of the things that fascinated me in the Naughty Dog press coverage of the accessibility features was the idea of the audio cue glossary. Audio-only games had “learn game sounds” menus years before this, but The Last of Us 2 marks the first time such a feature has been included in a mainstream title.\nEntering this menu, you are presented with something that, whilst it seems daunting, is a brilliant illustration of just how much care has been put into the thought process for these cues. The fact that I can use this list at any time to check what I’m hearing has assisted me on many occasions through my time with the game, even at points where I wouldn’t have thought it would’ve been available.\nAs much as it’s rather overwhelming seeing so many audio cues, it’s an amazing resource to have at your disposal at any time via the options menus mid-game, especially with the volume of cues present in the first place.\nMy only critique of the audio glossary is that it is not organised into subcategories such as combat, traversal, listen etc, but is just one long list. Other than that, looking through those cues proved invaluable at times.\nFirst Sequences\nThe first time you enter a particular type of sequence, be it stealth, combat, or interacting with the environment, you’ll notice that even the tutorial prompts are spoken. This is great since even as the sequences play out, you learn what happens when you press certain buttons in sequence for instance and not having to ask for sighted assistance is a bonus in and of itself.\nSaving And Loading Your Game\nUsually, the save system on the PS4 is not accessible without sighted assistance. However, within The Last of Us 2, Naughty Dog have provided narrated prompts once again to allow you to save your game and pick up where you left off, even having date and time information available. This means that not only can you have multiple save files, but you can also tell how recently you played, making this a huge bonus for completionists.\nThis is a great addition as, combined with the checkpoints feature, if you make an error in judgement or there are enemies you don’t realise exists for instance, you can learn as you play and make fewer and fewer mistakes as you figure out just what strategies work best.\nStealth\nStealth is a core part of The Last of Us 2 gameplay, much like it was in the first game. It is also one of the most rewarding aspects of the game, in that you have to scan for enemies and, using the tools and cues at your disposal, take them out with gloriously brutal sound design to accompany it. The sound design in the entire game is without a doubt top-notch, but the combat and atmosphere is where it shines most prominently in my view.\nSpeaking of sound design, the audio cues and narration don’t feel forced or too out of place, just as if they were meant to be there from the start. It definitely goes to show that implementing these features as early as possible in development can make a world of difference.\nAuto-aim and locking\nThe auto-aim mechanics of Gears 5 have been, for me at least, the gold standard for shooting without sight in mainstream games since that title released, as you had the ability to utilise your precision with a shot through lining it up yourself rather than having it snap to your next target as you’d see in say Uncharted 4.\nNaughty Dog’s approach for The Last of Us 2, on the other hand, feels like an evolution of the Gears 5 system, with you looking at a target and the game giving you audio cues to select what kind of shot you want to take. You do have the option to adjust your line of sight as well if needed by moving the camera around as you’d expect, though this isn’t usually a factor as these are scenarios where arguably you want to play it stealthy rather than going in guns blazing.\nThe interesting part? The text description of how the system works tells you pretty much everything you need to know in comparison to Gears 5 where nothing was stated about how to get started with taking down your foes.\nCover\nCover is one of those points that comes up a fair amount when discussing navigation. Whether it’s within the gritty, chainsaw gun-wielding Gearsiverse or the worlds of stealth titles like Horizon: Zero Dawn, the question has always been “how do we know where the cover is without sight?” Naughty Dog’s solution, ingeniously, is what essentially amounts to allowing a gamer without sight to have a portable piece of cover at all times, or more accurately, a Ghillie suit of sorts.\nThis comes in the form of going prone. At the maximum setting, you are invisible to the vast majority of enemies in the game, for an infinite period of time. This can of course be shortened to increase the challenge, but on my first playthrough I gave myself the option of having infinite prone invisibility should I need to, say, gain a better vantage point and figure out my next move, or better assess enemy positions outside of the scanning available in listen mode.\nRetreating\nWhen in a fight, it’s clearly sometimes better to retreat rather than face overwhelming odds. After all, you’re not the Doomguy who thrives on ripping and tearing his enemies to regain vitality. Instead, you are a survivalist, admittedly badass, but fragile as any human in this cruel and unrelenting world.\nConsequently, there are times where you need to leave combat behind in a frantic escape at which point the navigational assistance can, for lack of a better word, assist you. Of course it doesn’t just work for leaving your enemies in the dust, it also allows you to traverse the world without sighted assistance, but being able to find a way out of the current mess you’ve unintentionally got yourself into is certainly a comforting notion.\nThe Learning Curve\nAs great as all this agency is, it does come with a cost of learning, albeit a relatively slight one. I found myself occasionally not knowing what one of the numerous sound cues meant, but the glossary was there to clear my confusion. I’d find myself stuck as to how to progress, then realised that I hadn’t enabled a particular accessibility option, with the text stating that essentially I should’ve done so beforehand.\nOf course, every player will have different opinions on what options to set to what values or what difficulty they want to play on, but for me, learning all this has been a great experience as I don’t have to have anyone nearby to tell me what to do or where to go etc.\nAfter around half an hour or so, I found myself easing into this new freedom the game allows me and enjoying every second of the story and the journey that so many with sight may take for granted. Being able to boot up the game, pick up where I left off and continue on the road towards my next destination all with the press of a few buttons is so uplifting.\nAudio Description\nThere is, at the time of writing at least, no audio description within the cutscenes and in-game events of The Last of Us 2. However,the details you miss are forgotten when you consider the fact that the story is easy enough to follow just because of great scripting, sound design, scoring and voice acting.\nAt times, the TTS will narrate additional pieces of information that are useful to be aware of for story reasons, thus making the lack of AD even less of an issue than it otherwise might be. Hopefully though, Naughty Dog could leverage this facet of the medium of film and theatre for future titles, even if it doesn’t make its way into this current masterpiece.\nHaptics\nLike Uncharted 4 and other titles before it, The Last of Us 2 use of haptics is extremely useful, not just in getting you immersed within interactions with the environment, but also with elements that are required for story progression. I won’t say what these are to prevent spoilers, but suffice it to say those working on this game even managed to push haptics further than they have been before in terms of their use in accessibility for gamers without sight.\nSummary\nPros\n- Most accessibility features I’ve seen in a mainstream video game to date.\n- Time and effort has clearly been put into all aspects of these systems\n- Sound design, score and voice acting are all top quality and help enhance enjoyment and immersion in the hard-hitting story\n- I can play the game entirely without sighted assistance\nCons\n- Cue glossary could be better organised\n- Lacking audio description for clarity in terms of story events\n- TTS is not on by default on start up screen\n- Slight learning curve to audio cues and navigational systems that admittedly eases almost immediately\nScore: 9.5/10\nThe only things that prevent me from giving The Last of Us 2 a perfect 10/10 score are relatively small issues such as seeing items seemingly through walls and being unable to easily collect them, being unable to easily determine which object I’m interacting with when two are close together and settings that I would’ve thought were turned on by default not being so under certain circumstances. Thankfully though, the possibilities afforded by games being able to be patched means that these and other small points like the lack of audio description could potentially be addressed later down the line.\nThe hard work of the team at Naughty Dog and everyone else who has contributed to this masterpiece cannot be understated, regardless of the scores on reviews. The point still stands: I can play this game without needing sighted assistance and get farther than I ever have in an open world environment unaided, without feeling the frustration of knowing I’ll eventually have to ask for a sighted player’s direct assistance. That alone is a fantastic achievement.\nConclusions\nAs much as people had hyped this game up before launch, I’ve always maintained that it’s one thing to see demos of a game’s accessibility and another to play the title for yourself and utilise those features in person. I’m very glad to see that the hype was just as valid as I thought it would be when I saw the initial press coverage, with Naughty Dog putting a massive amount of effort into making sure everything works as intended.\nWhilst no game is perfect, especially in terms of accessibility for gamers without sight, The Last of Us 2 is a testament to what can be achieved when accessibility is considered from the ground up and is extremely close to being flawless. I only hope that both platform developers and teams working on updates to current titles and future projects take this for what it is: an example to push the industry forward to new heights and a bar to work from. I have thoroughly enjoyed my time with this game and can’t wait to see what innovations arise from this title going forward.\nDisclaimer: The copy of the game used in this review was provided by the publisher at no cost to the reviewer .",

            "text": "‘The Last of Us Part 2’ Review (PS4)\nI’ll be honest. I’ve had over a week to really reflect on this game and I’m still digesting what it had to say. Prior to its release, there was already controversy thanks to the unfortunate leaks which I purposefully dodged which created backlash from fans saying it was a betrayal of the game or that Naughty Dog dropped the ball. It’s hard to make lightning strike twice especially if you had the monumental acclaim that the first part had so I wasn’t expecting the same thing to happen again but what The Last of Us Part 2 does is take things in a direction that won’t be for everyone but I think it’s different from anything that you would expect for better or worse.\nTo really delve into the story involves talking about massive spoilers and it’s where the heart of the controversies surrounding this game really lies and being vague won’t explain why the story has been so polarizing among the fanbase. Honestly, it’s another article in itself (hint, hint). The Last of Us Part 2 takes place five years after the events of the first game. Ellie and Joel have settled into Jackson and have got a pretty normal life all things considered in the post-outbreak world. However, this all comes crashing down after a mysterious group attack and Ellie decides to seek revenge which results in a lot of brutal violence and murder. The revenge theme has people split in the middle. Some see it as a lazy aesop saying ‘revenge is bad’ when in truth, it’s a bit more complex than that. Yes, this game does make it clear how revenge is a constant spiral but what I took away from it was how love can put anyone on a path of vicious hatred and how dehumanising it can be for the person and how they view others if that person is hurt enough. When the story starts, you are wholeheartedly on Ellie’s side but as the game goes on and you keep committing these horrible acts again and again, you can’t help but start to think about the other side of this. How Ellie must look in the eyes of others and if Ellie really is any better than the very people she’s fighting against. The story challenges you and removes that narrative bias for the player because it really goes into exploring both sides of the story. It’s made clear that there’ll be no catharsis or peace from going after the person that wronged Ellie but Ellie herself doesn’t realise that. In fact, the bleak reality hits you in the face so by the end, you aren’t longing for a final confrontation. You just want Ellie to walk away. The story is effective in that regard but the way it tells this narrative is divisive which I’ll have to talk about more another time.\nThe pacing is a point of understandable critique for many. There are a lot of time jumps in this game from present day to events that take place years and months ago regularly. There is a lot of ground to cover considering it’s been five years since we last saw Ellie and a lot has happened since the end of the first game. Also this game has a habit of getting things to a dramatic and tension-filled high point only to send you into an elongated flashback which kills the momentum the scene originally had going for it by the time you return.\nAnother thing that has been a subject of debate is how The Last of Us Part 2 handles certain plot points. The key plot thread that got most of us wanting a Part 2 was the lie Joel told Ellie which could have been its own game. It was heavily implied it would have massive consequences and to some degree, it does but not the ones people were expecting which can feel like a wasted opportunity to some. Another part of the story which has been critiqued is the guerilla warfare plot. In Seattle, there are two warring factions. One is military and the other is a religious cult. Both are interesting to learn about but being dragged into their war has no real consequence for any of the main characters. It reaches a climax in the last few hours of the game but you’re basically a witness to it rather than a key player in it. It feels like the game was building up to confrontations with certain people or leaders on both sides in the second half but it results in massive anticlimaxes to tie up loose ends which everyone quickly moves on from.\nMoving onto the gameplay, there isn’t much change from the last game. Naughty Dog obviously expects you to have played the first game so there’s nothing more than brief refreshers at the beginning about how the combat mechanics and crafting works. You still have to sneak around infected or humans and strategically take them out one by one. If you get swamped by enemies then you are most definitely going to die unless you manage to find your way out of an area while under fire. There’s a lot of exploring and walking around to collect resources to craft weapons like trap mines, stun bombs, molotov cocktails. Depending on the difficulty you’re playing on, these resources can be hard to find so try to save weapons for when they are an absolute must. There are a few new enemy variants like dogs and new infected creatures. If you’re a dog lover then this game will already be tough because they track your scent and if you can’t lose them then you’ll be left with no choice but to brutally kill them. It could just be my experience but there were moments when I had an enemy in my sight and then inexplicably they managed to dodge my shot like they knew I was there even though there was no way they could have seen me. Admittedly because of the game’s thirty hour campaign, there are times where it starts to get repetitive especially the first half which is a lot of rinse and repeat of ‘get rid of a certain amount of soldiers or sneak around infected’ until you reach the next bit in the narrative which is just finding another target. The second half switches things up in a bold way narratively but also gameplay wise because it’s more action heavy, has proper boss fights and set pieces.\nGraphically, Naughty Dog continues to deliver. The first Last of Us was a swan song for the PS3 and pushed it to the limits of what it could achieve and Naughty Dog has done the same here. It looks and sounds like the real world. You spend a majority of the game in Seattle and it’s absolutely stunning. Nature has completely overtaken the city where roads and pavements are covered in luscious grass, buildings are tilting over, animals are roaming free and the seas are raging. It makes you wish there was a bit more than rain for most of the game but it’s Seattle so at least it’s an accurate representation. Video game characters have never looked and felt so close to reality with their subtle changes in expressions, body language that is uncomfortably realistic when it comes to violence as there’s no glamourising in that regard which is intentionally sickening.\nFor me, the story and characters is where The Last of Us Part 2 really shines and for that reason alone, I recommend checking it out. This sequel didn’t take the safe route by repeating the same themes or too many of the narrative tropes from the first game. The secret to understanding The Last of Us Part 2 is that the characters defy the plot you would expect to see. I’m still grasping at the meaning of it all after sitting through the emotional and harrowing challenge. You may beat the game and completely miss the cautionary tale about grief and pain (and judging from the disgusting reactions and death threats sent to the actors and developers, many have) because you’re too caught up in that initial brutal punch in the gut Part 2 starts with which feels like life imitating art. The ultimate lesson that we can take away from it especially in a time where there’s a lot of bigotry and hatred being spread is how we don’t have to necessarily forgive the people who wrong us but we should do better than viciously lashing out.\nThe Last of Us Part 2 is out now on Playstation 4.",

            "text": "The Last of Us Part II (or The Last of Us 2 as many fans call it) is the sequel to one of the best PS3 games and best PS4 games of all time, which told the story of Joel, a gruff smuggler, and Ellie, the teenage girl he is charged with protecting.\nJoel and Ellie try to survive a world in which a large chunk of the population has become infected with mind-controlling spores. And now they’re back for a second round. Here’s everything we know about The Last of Us 2, including the game’s release date, trailers, gameplay and pre-order options.\nThe Last of Us 2 release date: When is the game coming out?\nThe Last of Us 2 release date was June 19, 2020. And we've discovered the best way to play The Last of Us 2.\nWhile originally slated for release in early 2020, the coronavirus pandemic spoiled these plans. In a post on Twitter in April, developer Naughty Dog announced that while the game is near completion, it wanted to launch the game under better circumstances.\nThe Last of Us 2 is currently on sale in the PlayStation Store.\nA message from us about the delay of The Last of Us Part II: pic.twitter.com/aGsSRfmJ8aApril 2, 2020\nInitially TLoU2 was scheduled for release on Feb. 21, 2020. However, Kotaku broke the news that the game had been delayed until “Spring 2020.” Soon after, Neil Druckman, the game’s director, officially announced a new release date of May 29, 2020.\nThe Last of Us 2 trailer\nThe first trailer for TLoU2 appeared at the PlayStation Experience in December 2016. Here it shows a lot of forest environments, plus Ellie playing her guitar with a dead body at her feet, and promising a bearded man who approaches her (likely Joel but we can’t see his face) that she’s going to kill a bunch of people.\nOur next glimpse at the game came at E3 2018, which moves between a cutscene Ellie at a dance with her friends and gameplay, involving a stealth infiltration of an enemy hideout.\nThe melee and bow combat are instantly familiar to those who played the previous game, but the developers have said that there are major differences between how Joel played in that game and how Ellie, the main player character this time around, works in this one. For example, the trailer seems to show Ellie can dodge attacks, grab enemy weapons and go prone to hide in grass or duck under low cover.\nMost recently, the release announcement at Sony’s State of Play event in September 2019 came in the form of another trailer (viewable in the video below from 18:24 onwards).\nIt shows us more of the settlement Ellie has moved into since the last game, and how the dreaded ‘clicker’ enemies from the previous game are not too far away from this safe haven. There’s some more hints of new mechanics too, like horse riding and driving boats. Finally, there’s a lot of story information, hinting at why Ellie has sworn revenge on the cult-like group she’s pursuing, and reintroducing us to an older Joel.\nIn May 2020, after announcing the game had 'gone gold' (was ready for launch), Naughty Dog put out an \"Official Story Trailer\" on Twitter and YouTube (below). This one features Joel speaking to Ellie about her mission of revenge, being critical of her goal. We also see more infected enemies, horseback riding, Ellie taking out what we assume to be members of the enemy cult, and a new ally who like Joel is only partially supportive of what Ellie is up to.\nThe Last of Us 2 reviews\nA number of outlets received early review copies of The Last of Us 2, and so far, they've had nearly universal praise for the game. While most reviewers haven't assigned scores for the game, or are posting reviews-in-progress for the moment, words like \"gorgeous,\" \"complex\" and \"stunning\" keep popping up.\nWithout rehashing exactly what other reviewers have said, The Last of Us 2 appears to be a deep, immersive, brutal game, just like its predecessor. Whether the story will satisfy everyone remains to be seen, but the care that Naughty Dog put into the narrative and characters seems evident. There's no guarantee that fans of the first game will like the second, but it does seem to have the same elements they loved last time around.\nThe Last of Us 2 editions: what versions of the game are available?\nThere are four different versions of The Last of Us Part II, but fortunately they’re fairly easy to tell apart as each edition adds more on top of the bundle before it.\nThe Standard Edition (opens in new tab) ($59.99) comes with just the game disc but offers a full digital version of the game too, as well as in-game bonuses in the form of an ammo capacity upgrade for Ellie’s pistol and a crafting training manual which unlocks extra crafting and upgrade recipes instantly.\nPre-ordering the Standard Edition also gets you a PSN Avatar image of Ellie’s tattoo, so you can represent your love of the series on your profile.\nThe Special Edition (opens in new tab) ($79.99) adds a steelbook case and a 48-page mini art book, with a dynamic PS4 theme and six PlayStation Network avatars.\nThe Collector’s Edition (opens in new tab) ($169.99) is a big jump up, adding a 12-inch (30cm) statue of game protagonist Ellie playing her guitar, a lithograph art print, a pack of five stickers and six enamel pins, a digital copy of the soundtrack and also a replica of the bracelet worn by Ellie (which you can also see on Dina’s wrist in the E3 2018 trailer above).\nFinally, the Ellie Edition (opens in new tab) ($229.99) contains everything already mentioned plus a vinyl record containing music from the game’s soundtrack, a fabric patch of the game’s logo, and a replica of Ellie’s backpack.\nAll of the above are physical editions, but there’s also a Digital Deluxe Edition ($69.99) which combines the PS4 theme, six PSN avatars, digital soundtrack and a digital version of the art book, along with the in-game bonuses.\nThe Last of Us 2 pre-order: where can I buy the game?\nYou can pre-order TLoU2 from several stores already. In the US you’ve got Amazon (opens in new tab), Best Buy (opens in new tab) and GameStop (opens in new tab), while UK readers can head to Amazon UK or Game. Alternatively, you can go straight to the PlayStation Store to order a digital edition.\nThe Last of Us 2 multiplayer: Is there any?\nThe first Last of Us game offered a competitive multiplayer ‘Factions’ mode, but unfortunately, Naughty Dog announced that there would be no multiplayer element in TLoU2, citing the ambitious and work intensive nature of the single player campaign as the reason.\nAn update regarding multiplayer: pic.twitter.com/CUd98LgJGCSeptember 27, 2019\nHowever, as the above tweet indicates, there has been work on a multiplayer mode, and we will be seeing the results of it at a later date. This could be in the form of an update to the main game after the release, or perhaps an entirely separate spin-off title.\nThe Last of Us 2 gameplay\nBeyond what we see in the trailers, there’s been some limited hands-on time available for the game which fortunately we got to experience. You can read about our full The Last of Us Part 2 Hands-on report here, but to briefly summarize what we saw, the two sections involved typical stealthy combat with few resources. Our hands-on demo took place in Jackson, Wyoming and Seattle, and pitted us against infected and human enemies.\nOn May 27, Sony released an extended play video for The Last of Us Part 2, where we got to see the stealth, the combat and some of the level design in action. We've embedded it below, so you can see for yourself how Ellie will tackle some of the challenges she meets along the way. (Spoilers: Violently.)\nThe Last of Us 2 characters: where's Joel?\nIn the first game, players controlled Joel, while Ellie was an AI-controlled companion, who could help out in fights, but also needed help crossing the platforming puzzles in the game. There were a few moments you took control of Ellie but it was very much Joel’s game.\nThis time, Ellie is the player character. Joel will appear in the game at some points, as confirmed by the most recent trailers, and Dina is also accompanying you for at least a small part of the game, but whether we’ll see a full reversal of the original’s player and companion mechanic, or a more solo experience, remains to be seen. It's also unclear whether Joel will be playable or not, even if only briefly like certain sections of the first Last of Us.\nThe Last of Us 2 PS5: is it coming to next-gen?\nSince the game is developed by Naughty Dog, a California-based developer owned by Sony, it should come as no surprise that TLoU2 is exclusive to the PlayStation 4. The original TLoU was a PlayStation 3 exclusive, and was later remastered for the PS4. We already know that all PS4 games will work on the upcoming PS5, though there’s no word on whether Sony’s next-gen console will get its own enhanced version of The Last of Us 2.\nWhat about The Last of Us 2 on PC?\nWhile The Last of Us 2 will obviously be exclusive to Sony platforms, there could be a chance that it’ll be playable on PC in some form. Sony’s PlayStation Now streaming service currently lets you stream PS4 God of War, The Last of Us and Uncharted 4 to your PC, so it’s possible that The Last of Us 2 could join the service at some point. But certainly don’t hold your breath for an Xbox One or Switch version.",

This could be in the form of an update to the main game after the release, or perhaps an entirely separate spin-off title.\nThe Last of Us 2 gameplay\nBeyond what we see in the trailers, there’s been some limited hands-on time available for the game which fortunately we got to experience. You can read about our full The Last of Us Part 2 Hands-on report here, but to briefly summarize what we saw, the two sections involved typical stealthy combat with few resources. Our hands-on demo took place in Jackson, Wyoming and Seattle, and pitted us against infected and human enemies.\nOn May 27, Sony released an extended play video for The Last of Us Part 2, where we got to see the stealth, the combat and some of the level design in action. We've embedded it below, so you can see for yourself how Ellie will tackle some of the challenges she meets along the way. (Spoilers: Violently.)\nThe Last of Us 2 characters: where's Joel?\nIn the first game, players controlled Joel, while Ellie was an AI-controlled companion, who could help out in fights, but also needed help crossing the platforming puzzles in the game. There were a few moments you took control of Ellie but it was very much Joel’s game.\nThis time, Ellie is the player character. Joel will appear in the game at some points, as confirmed by the most recent trailers, and Dina is also accompanying you for at least a small part of the game, but whether we’ll see a full reversal of the original’s player and companion mechanic, or a more solo experience, remains to be seen. It's also unclear whether Joel will be playable or not, even if only briefly like certain sections of the first Last of Us.\nThe Last of Us 2 PS5: is it coming to next-gen?\nSince the game is developed by Naughty Dog, a California-based developer owned by Sony, it should come as no surprise that TLoU2 is exclusive to the PlayStation 4. The original TLoU was a PlayStation 3 exclusive, and was later remastered for the PS4. We already know that all PS4 games will work on the upcoming PS5, though there’s no word on whether Sony’s next-gen console will get its own enhanced version of The Last of Us 2.\nWhat about The Last of Us 2 on PC?\nWhile The Last of Us 2 will obviously be exclusive to Sony platforms, there could be a chance that it’ll be playable on PC in some form. Sony’s PlayStation Now streaming service currently lets you stream PS4 God of War, The Last of Us and Uncharted 4 to your PC, so it’s possible that The Last of Us 2 could join the service at some point. But certainly don’t hold your breath for an Xbox One or Switch version.",

            "text": "The Last of Us Part II is the worst video game I’ve ever heard. For hours on end, thanks to the craftsmanship of top-notch audio engineers and dedicated performers, you will hear sounds of human misery: people shrieking in pain, pleading for their life, gagging and gurgling as blood seeps out of them. If you heard it all without the benefit of context, perhaps by being in an adjacent room while someone played, you’d register a parade of murder that would seem exceedingly difficult to justify. And you would be right. It’s not justified. Trouble is, The Last of Us Part II thinks itself clever by making this the point of its story, seemingly unaware that one does not need a thirty-hour video game to make this point.\nIn The Last of Us Part II, nearly every character is as far from a “good day” as a person can be. The protagonist, a young woman named Ellie, endures something terrible, and everyone involved in perpetrating it must pay with their lives. Her path to revenge is full of perhaps the most unsettlingly rendered violence a video game has portrayed in some time, most of it committed by the person playing the game.\nThe PlayStation 4 release is the sequel to 2013’s The Last of Us, which was set in a world where the real-life cordyceps fungi — a grotesque parasite that inhabited insects, causing them to behave erratically — has made the leap to humans. These fungal zombies, known as “infected,” are violent, carnivorous, and highly contagious, releasing spores that will infect others. However, like The Walking Dead, it isn’t the afflicted that represent the real horror. Rather, it’s the behavior of the people who remain after the parasite’s arrival brings about the end of civilization as we know it.\nWhen the first Last of Us game debuted in 2013, zombie fiction was already trite and exhausting, but the game still succeeded by virtue of being a technical marvel that also focused squarely on its characters. The game cast players as Joel, a smuggler charged with bringing Ellie across the country for reasons unknown to him. Eventually, he discovers that Ellie is immune to infection, and he’s bringing her to the last remaining medical facility in the States in the hopes of developing a cure. In a climax that is still a high-water mark for big-budget video games, it’s revealed that developing a vaccine would kill Ellie, and so the player, as Joel, decides to murder the surgeons and their attendant militia guards just as an unconscious Ellie is about to go under the knife, unaware of her fate. The game’s final moment jumps ahead sometime later, as Joel lies to Ellie and tells her there was no cure, and she receives his story with an uncertain: “Okay.”\nThe ambiguity of Ellie’s response extends throughout The Last of Us Part II, set four years later as Joel and Ellie have settled down in Jackson, Wyoming, an area that has managed to become a flourishing city despite the horror that surrounds it. As Ellie, players get a brief taste of idyllic life in the post-apocalypse before something terrible happens, inciting her vengeful mission. As in many revenge stories, the closer Ellie gets to her goal the more reprehensible she acts, with a horrible mess left in her wake.\nWhere The Last of Us Part II differs from past stories of blind vengeance is that it’s a video game that requires 25 to 30 hours to complete. Across that time, the actions undertaken by the player are largely the same: carefully navigating a hostile environment in order to find enough supplies to dispatch or slip past a small army of infected, cultists, or militia members. The ensuing excess of violence would seem pointless if the game wasn’t so interested in re-contextualizing the things it made you do, seemingly damning you for treating the digital foes in front of you as fodder to be put down rather than representations of real people.\nThe game does this in two ways. The most direct is by regularly presenting the player with situations where fighting is the only way forward. Those scenes are among the most brutal in a modern video game. Shoot a foe dead and their partner will scream their name; attack with a melee weapon and your target with wail in agony; use a blade and they’ll choke on their own blood. In video games, combat is a puzzle, a maze with shifting hazards to navigate. Removing those hazards is cathartic — and Last of Us wants to complicate that catharsis, often leaving you with no other options. There are several parts of the game where you can skillfully evade conflict, but there are many scripted, unavoidable duels, and they are all grisly.\nThen there’s the narrative itself, which is the other way the game gradually confronts players with the consequences of the violence they enact as Ellie. Throughout the story, players fight not just the infected, but also members of a militia, and a strange, violent cult. Lives you end in the first act are recontextualized by a major perspective shift in the second, characters you root against take sympathetic turns, and no faction (besides the zombies) is universally composed of heroes or villains. How do you feel taking a life, the game asks, over and over again, if you know other people cared about that person? Meanwhile, it literally leaves you no other choices.\nThe Last of Us Part II is perhaps the biggest, and most anticipated video game this year. It’s worth understanding why. The title is the latest from Naughty Dog, a studio with a reputation for games that aspire to the aesthetics and prestige of cinema, with memorable characters that behave realistically despite the unreality of video games. As a shop, Naughty Dog is extremely good at this; they are notorious for the perfectionism with which they approach game design.\nThe studio has often sidestepped criticism of crunch culture — a practice where developers collectively put in excessively long hours to meet a deadline, thereby exerting implicit pressure on their peers to do the same, perpetuating a cycle of burnout and health risks — by self-selection. You work at Naughty Dog because you want to make games that are best in class. Naughty Dog makes best-in-class games because everyone involved is willing to go the extra mile.\nFor those who know to look for it, the Naughty Dog difference is dazzling. You rarely see your character’s face when they are sneaking up behind a foe to silently render them unconscious, but tilt the camera around and you’ll see it’s twisted into an ugly sneer befitting ugly work. Characters will, unprompted, shake their wrists loose, giving little grace notes that make them feel like real people. Weapons are painstakingly replicated, and you can watch characters break them down on a workbench. Most astonishing is that Naughty Dog seems to be the only studio with the patience to attempt to recreate the physics that govern how ropes work — every rope you handle in the game spools, dangles, and swings with near-fidelity. To the layman, that may not seem like a big deal. But no one else does this, because it’s an absurd amount of work, work that’s only worth it if you want to blow away your peers.\nNaughty Dog is also a studio renowned for their approach to narrative — arguably making the authored parts of their games more compelling than the played ones. The Last of Us Part II puts much of its energy into things — themes, ideas — that you do not need to get from a video game, including many that you likely have already seen elsewhere — Oldboy, for example, or The End of Evangelion. Every selling point of Part II — its excellent performances, arresting vistas, unparalleled sound design, emphasis on story — exist outside the scope of player actions. The game’s primary focus with its interactivity lies in culpability: in the idea that, by way of controlling characters on the predetermined narrative tracks laid out for them, you are complicit when their actions take horrible turns. This is less of a clever twist than a tired notion explored in games like 2007’s Bioshock and 2008’s Braid, both of which came long before the first Last of Us.\nIn the world of mainstream games, popularity and quality are often considered interchangeable. Invest enough resources in a game to clear the threshold of competence, and then spend enough money to market it well, and you can more or less guarantee at least a modest hit. At this point in the medium’s development, games play people better than people play them. Studios have the data; they know what people like doing and what they don’t, the weapons they prefer and ones they ignore, what routes they take through a map and where they are most likely to fail. The whole enterprise is scripted. The Last of Us Part II is the result of a formula that’s been refined for more than 20 years, one that was essentially perfected by its predecessor.\nVideo games are often eager to please, and it’s notably remarkable that Naughty Dog set out to provide an objectively unlikable experience — one featuring a main character who marches well past the point of no return, one that compels you to commit to terrible violence to see it through. Except the game is not unlikable. Divorced from its plot, in the moments when you are stalking foes and finding clever ways to silently dispatch the people and monsters out to kill you, you feel good. You feel powerful. And that belies the game’s central cynicism: it makes the violence central and unavoidable and generally fun. In that way, the game sinks down to the muck with everything else it wants to be better than.\nThe Last of Us Part II can be read as a treatise on violence with a surprisingly shallow take: that it is dehumanizing, and terrible despite the care with which it is rendered. That’s not what the game spends 30 hours on, though. Instead, the reason the game needs to be an epic is because it’s interested in an idea even more facile than that: That there are good and bad people on every side of a conflict, that you don’t really know where someone comes from or why they believe what they believe. It wants to be a work that isn’t really against revenge, but tribalism, arguing that the act of people banding together by necessity demands the othering of your peers, and that othering is what breeds violence.\nYet it still can’t imagine a world without dividing lines. Even its vision of Jackson, Wyoming — the closest thing to an ideal community the game can imagine — exists within walls, where those outside are suspect, and those inside ought not leave. Why would they? The world is full of other people.",

            "text": "'The Last Of Us Part 2' Review: A Superb Story, Poorly Paced\nPublished\n| Last updated\nFeatured Image Credit: Sony/Naughty Dog\nThe following review is free of story spoilers for The Last Of Us Part II. But due to the nature of the game, those hoping to experience it completely fresh may want to read ahead with caution, regardless.\nThe Last Of Us Part II is bleak. It is soul-crushing and, at times, too uncomfortable to continue on. In many respects it is the natural continuation of the violent world introduced in The Last Of Us, where the grim weight of existence was often too much for the characters to bear, but they did because they were driven by the hope of a better world. In this sequel there is no hope - only survival. At any cost.\nPrior to the game's release, director Neil Druckmann spoke at length about how the sequel would deal with themes of rage and revenge. Undoubtedly, the story of The Last Of Us Part II will polarise fans long after reaching its conclusion. After 25 hours of play time and days of reflection, I'm still not sure how I feel about it. But I know that it will prove to be one of the most discussed games in recent history, bearing whatever caveats that title brings.\nFive years have passed since Joel lied to Ellie about the Fireflies' plans to kill her in order to create a cure for the infectious fungus that has decimated mankind. Five years since they settled down in the makeshift town of Jackson, Wyoming. And in those five years, the relationship between the pair has gradually eroded away.\nEllie is now a young woman who lives her life on the outskirts of society, but who joins the frequent patrols that aim to clear and secure the town's perimeter of threats to the burgeoning populace. She has forged new relationships - chief amongst them the headstrong and mischievous Dina, another of the town's residents and capable peacekeepers, played with marvelous nuance by Westworld's Shannon Woodward.\nAs much as The Last Of Us crafted a complex affinity between Ellie and Joel, their story was very much inclusive of each other, with other characters relegated to orbital roles. In Part II, there is a much wider cast that developers Naughty Dog have integrated into the narrative, so as to make them feel mostly (note: mostly) natural. The obliterating emotional range of all the actors on display though is worthy of praise, especially that of Ashley Johnson who turns in a powerhouse performance as Ellie.\nWhat is going to polarise people so much, I believe, is the way in which this story plays out. The overarching tale of revenge and the unfurling repercussions of different character's actions, while resolute in their concept, are told almost backwardly. You are asked to identify with characters that have done atrocious things within the first few hours, who can then never fully atone themselves to the audience through their actions, if indeed they're even seeking redemption. If time was spent building towards these acts through exploring backstories and displaying motives first, I think it would have been a much richer experience.\nTo the game's credit, there are a lot of memorable moments to glean from the story. Most notably in a number of flashback sequences scattered throughout, as well as some easily overlooked interactions during the numerous exploration portions in the game. That's not to say the main thrust of the story - the moment to moment beats - is sub-par, though. Indeed, the portrayals of even bit-part characters are sublime, and it's easy to swallow the 'why' of the script. It's just that the 'how' has stuck in my throat too much to ignore.\nThere's no denying that The Last Of Us Part II takes risks. Introducing a wide-ranging cast of ethnicities and orientations was, sadly, always going to be counted as a risk when considering certain audiences. What I love about these characters and their depictions, though, is that they never feel like they're there to tick a box - as can be the case in other games, movies and TV. Everything is a level playing field - who these characters are is ultimately incidental to what they do and why they do it. Anyone looking for supposed 'agenda-pushing' won't find it here. But while the game palpably pushes the envelope of representation very well for the medium, the odd pacing constantly undermines the strength of the story being told, and those brought in to tell it.\nThe darker world that overtures the story is one that would put even the most macabre of post-apocalyptic timelines to shame. Death in The Last Of Us Part II is treated so matter-of-factly that killing your human opponents quickly turns from a giddy thrill into an incredibly distressing task. Stealth kills earn themselves a special mention. With a tap of the triangle button Ellie can grab an unsuspecting foe from behind before dragging them to a secluded spot and plunging her knife into their throat with no more than an eyelid batted.\nWhat makes these encounters so traumatic is both the way they are delivered, and the clarity of the achingly gorgeous graphics. You see every inch of the knife enter and exit the neck, dark blood oozing out of the new wound as Ellie's victim helplessly gurgles their last breath, often clawing desperately for air. Ellie remains unphased, only affected by the effort she had to exert to accomplish the task.\nPlaying on a PS4 Pro, The Last Of Us Part II is already at the apex of what the current generation of technology will allow, and will doubtless look even better on the upcoming PS5. Its version of Seattle has grown green and lush, with foliage reclaiming the crumbling concrete skyscrapers after 25 years of human abandonment, and there are times where standing still to appreciate the natural elegance of what the city has become is far preferable to advancing the foreboding story.\nThe gameplay itself is only a marginal improvement over The Last Of Us, and still plays second-fiddle to the story. Players are able to make use of a number of key skills - like scaling up ropes, smashing windows and most importantly, the ability to jump and vault. This opens up levels with a new verticality reminiscent of Naughty Dog's other blockbuster title of this generation, Uncharted 4. But more importantly, it feels like the kind of 'bigger and better' inclusion you'd expect from a sequel.\nA lot of the optional exploration requires finding hidden paths and following them using your intuition. Some encounters, too, take place in the ruins of Seattle's once-thriving downtown area, meaning players can move up and down throughout multiple floors with relative impunity to get the drop on unsuspecting foes.\nWhile stealth is unreservedly the primary approach for enemy encounters (usually, it's better to slip past them undetected using your heightened listening ability) the arsenal at your disposal is usually more than enough to deal with threats - bearing in mind that it's incredibly easy to become overwhelmed. It's better to run and live to fight another day, than it is to die like a dog for no good reason. Being the kind of masochist who simply has to explore every last corner of a map, though, I found myself more often than not ruthlessly hunting down enemies so as to find each collectable, crafting item and piece of ammunition before moving on.\nYou can now also brawl with some human (and lesser infected) enemies, which makes combat feel more fluid than before. Assuming you can get it right, that is. Getting up close to an enemy can instigate a sort of quick-time mini-game where you must dodge and weave their attacks in order to open the opportunity to counter with your own. Tapping L1 at the right moment will send an opponent's wildly thrown fist or makeshift weapon effortlessly over your shoulder, before a tap of the square button instigates a brutal attack of your own. Wrapping a rusted machete into an enemy's midriff is scarcely more satisfying than when it's the result of a short scrap for survival, and its outcome is rarely more inhuman to live with.\nThe new bestiary of enemies in The Last Of Us Part II opens up a welcome challenge for veterans of the first game. Dogs are used by opponents to patrol some areas, and their ability to pick up on your scent means you can never get too complacent with your hiding spot as you quietly work out your next moves. There are also the Shamblers - a new type of infected that spews noxious clouds of acid that burn their victims alive, unless you get out of the way. Like Clickers, they are blind unless you aggravate them or stumble into their paths; but mixed with a group of Runners they can quickly become lethal if provoked, especially on the higher difficulties.\nYou'll also have a suite of new abilities to pour experience points into over the course of the game. A few different skill trees - such as Survival, Stealth and Precision - can be unlocked by finding field manuals around the environments, and spending supplements which must also be scavenged. While they may have been touted as encouraging players to lean into their own, distinct playstyles, these abilities amount to not much more than marginally enhancing things like your accuracy, movement speed and crafting ability. Some are useful, though. For example, I put a lot of points into Stealth, because I found myself using the all new pistol suppressors to deal with foes from range. Upgrading meant I could get more shots out of one before it broke, and I'd have to find more materials to craft a new one.\nCrafting things on the fly - like molotov cocktails, health packs and arrows - remains much the same as the last game, but weapons benches have had a nice visual overhaul. It adds nothing to how the game plays, but does help deepen the sense of realism that you're being fed throughout.\nDespite this new sense of accessibility, - 60 settings enabling audio or sight impaired players to experience the game with things like high contrast visuals, and contextual audio and vibration cues - the game does still suffer from the banal and repetitive nature of its predecessor, in that it's gameplay is still just a means to an end for advancing the story. General exploration leaks into encounters and back again repeatedly over the course of 25 hours, so much so that everything begins to blur some two-thirds through. Towards the end I found myself subconsciously willing the game to hurry along as I passed through set-piece after set-piece of essentially these same two processes.\nWhat I find myself contemplating the most after finishing The Last Of Us Part II, is that much like the game's story, I'm still conflicted. It's a game of several fundamental improvements - breath-taking graphics, mechanics that are a joy, outstanding performances across the board, and the sense of a deeper world having been built upon. But there's still the glaringly obvious issue of the story's wonky pacing, and what you actually do to advance it. As a video game sequel it ticks all the boxes of being bigger and better with more to say. But as a story, as an experience following one of the most critically acclaimed tales ever told in this medium, it sits uncomfortably on a knife's edge, waiting for the passage of time to pull it one way or the other.\n7/10: Very Good\nThe Last Of Us Part II is out on June 19th for PlayStation 4.

            "text": "The Last of Us, released by Naughty Dog and PlayStation in 2013 to cacophonous acclaim by the critical establishment, is perhaps the most significant exemplar of one of the biggest trends of its era of gaming: the dad game. Spawned (so to speak) by the fact that many upstart gaming studio heads began becoming parents in the early 2010s, the dad game centers on the relationship between a father and a child, using the language of games to emphasize that supposedly sacral protective bond. The child is usually a daughter—a character that, using the language of patriarchy, is defined as much by her vulnerability as anything else—and the games, being preoccupied with violence, are eager to utilize that character to give players something to protect.\nThe Last of Us was the quintessential dad game, starring a grizzled southern man doing terrible violence to safeguard his surrogate daughter, Ellie. It was postapocalyptic, so as to make the responsibility of the father figure, Joel, even more dire. It was brutal, hyperviolent, and occasionally sweet, in the way dad games are. \"What would you do for your child?\" the dad game asks, even as it works to insert just enough moral ambiguity to make things interesting, to make you wonder if this dad is, in fact, a good dad or a bad dad. Amid a field of competitors like Dishonored, BioShock Infinite, God of War, and the original Nier, The Last of Us stands above all others as the archetypal dad game. Its sequel, The Last of Us Part II, feels like the archetypal example of another smaller trend, a reaction to the first. The Last of Us Part II is a daughter game.\nThe daughter game emerges as a response to one of the most significant criticisms leveled at the dad game, the obvious observation that, in any given dad game, the most interesting character is usually the daughter. As the object of protection, the one who responds and must adapt to the world instead of fighting stubbornly and protectively against it, the daughter in a dad game usually ends up, accidentally, being the most sympathetic and complex character. So the daughter game, usually made by the same folks who made the dad games, is both a gesture of contrition and a posture of defensiveness. It's an admission that yes, you're right, she is more interesting, followed immediately by I can tell that story, too! Games like Dishonored 2 and, to an extent, Gears of War 5 and Nier Automata are daughter games—games that attempt to center the perspectives of the women, instead of the father figures. But that's a fraught proposition. As many women will tell you, few people arguably understand women less than their fathers. The paternal gaze can all too easily elide internal complexity in favor of external reactivity, seeing the daughter's actions not as a reflection of her own growth and legacy but of his.\nAs the quintessential daughter game, The Last of Us Part II is defined by its father figure, even as it moves on to telling stories about his progeny. That father figure is Joel, and the game takes on many of his attributes. Like Joel, it's cruel and violent, emotionally intense and a bit domineering. At the end of the original game, Joel makes a decision that cements Ellie as his surrogate daughter in the most toxic way possible, protecting her in a way that overwrites her agency, launching a cycle of revenge and brutality with no endpoint in sight. The Last of Us Part II is about the long tail of those decisions, and how they go on to shape Ellie and her own future, which is warped inexorably by Joel's choices, sent careening toward bloodshed. Ellie is forced to bear the weight of those choices and to try to reconcile herself with them, even as they send her on a winding, often horrific quest for revenge against a new set of enemies.\nWritten by the original game's director, Neil Druckmann, alongside TV writer Halley Gross, Part II's story wants to find its characters a path out of the cycle of revenge, a way out of life in the shadow of Joel. That path is monstrous, though crafted with all the care one would expect from the game studio that made the lauded Uncharted series. The frequent combat is desperate and authentically threatening; techniques borrowed from cinema are used elegantly to place narrative import on the most mundane moments of exploration and scavenging; the moment-to-moment writing is sharp, full of character, and beautifully acted.\nFrom one perspective, there's something extremely compelling about this combination of bloody aesthetic, nasty world, and the character of Ellie. It's refreshing to see women star in these kinds of stories. Of course women can be bloody revengers. Of course queer representation and people of color can exist alongside the triple-A videogame industry's pet obsessions. The history of women surviving to bring a reckoning upon their enemies in fiction is a rich one. There is a dark, animal joy to be found in being a woman wronged, sinking an axe into the skull of bastards who deserve it. The Last of Us Part II serves that joy with aplomb for nearly 30 hours straight.\nBut the father still rears his head. At some point, it becomes easy to wonder if the direction of The Last of Us Part II isn't, in some way, the result of a failure of imagination endemic to its dad-game past. This story, and the pull it generates over the gameplay, is one that can't escape its obsession with fathers and their children. Druckmann and Gross cannot imagine any relationship bearing the weight the father-daughter relationship bears. No connection influences its characters the way that one does. No burden pulls as hard, or as deeply. Even if the fathers were removed, the world of The Last of Us, a survivalist mess of zombies and bandits, cannibals and militants, is one built to highlight the needs and conflicts of the father who was the primary focus of the original game. One has to ask: Is Ellie's inability to grow, or develop, without in some way referencing her relationship with Joel a true aspect of her character? Or is it merely a preoccupation her writers cannot escape?\nThat's the problem with the daughter game, as exemplified, at least, by The Last of Us Part II. Even at its best, the daughter game still needs the father to justify itself. He is what the daughter game is a response to, a reaction against. The first Last of Us views Joel in both sentimentalizing and condemnatory terms. He is a bad man, a murderer and a scoundrel, but that game also wants to make room for the player to identify with and sympathize with his decisions, even if they end up breaking with him at the end. The Last of Us Part II has no tools to move past that understanding of Joel, and cannot take either the player or Ellie into a world beyond his influence. It may be that the game fails here, or it may be that no tools in the narrative toolbox created by the first game exist for this purpose. Every child has to, at some point, find a way to live that's different from their parents, but the daughter game can only work with what the dad game gives it. Push the dad away too much and The Last of Us Part II would be, for those who played the first, basically unrecognizable. That's not a risk that a game like this was ever going to take.\nThe Last of Us Part II is an excellent daughter game, perhaps one of the best games in its hyperviolent, prestige mold. Its later half, in particular, is formally and stylistically daring, pulling narrative tricks and reversals that manage to enrich the central narrative in surprising ways. But The Last of Us Part II feels like the ending of something, not the beginning. This is the father's story, all played out and brought to fruition through his daughter.

            "text": "This review contains comprehensive story and gameplay spoilers.\nThe Last of Us Part II starts with an image of a motorboat rocking on a dark blue shore. It’s nighttime, and the waters ahead are choppy. We can hear a quiet wind. When I first saw this image, I let it sit there for a bit onscreen, watching the boat wobble, wondering what it might mean for this blockbuster sequel that we’ve all been anticipating for so many years. Would this be the boat that takes you home? Or the one that strands you out at sea? Wherever this little vessel would bring us in the end, I thought, the waters ahead would be rough as hell.\nI was right. The sequel to The Last of Us is an outrageously disturbing game, an experience so ridden with traumatic imagery that I shuddered turning on my PS4 again to prepare myself for writing this review. But it’s also a courageous story, an important one, a game that I think anyone who's ever enjoyed a violent video game should experience for themselves, painful as it may be. The Last of Us Part II (out now on PS4) is not a movie, but I’ll be damned if I’ve seen a more compelling story told onscreen this year—video game, film, or otherwise.\nFinal warning: huge story details ahead.\nSomewhere within the opening hours of The Last of Us Part II, our expectations for this sequel are fractured. The first game was a superhero story—you played as Joel, the gruff, tortured, Western-type hero who used his superpowers as a marksman and face-puncher to save Ellie, his foster daughter, the only known human who’s immune to the zombie virus. In the first act of Part II, Joel, who once seemed invincible to danger, is beaten to death with a golf club. At first it seems reckless on the developers’ part. They just killed off one of the two reasons we love this series! But we soon begin to understand why Joel had to die. For this sequel to exist, for The Last of Us Part II to feel like anything other than a The Last of Us reunion special, the tired story of a violent man and his heroically violent means had to be shattered. It had to become something new.\nWhen Joel is killed, The Last of Us Part II goes flying in every direction, bringing to the surface new perspectives, new timelines, new characters. All of these threads emanate from one single act of brutality so cruel, so awful, that you’ll wonder how you were ever able to shoot a bad guy in a video game without feeling something before.\nKilling off the series' most violent character, though, doesn’t end up making The Last of Us Part II any less violent. Ellie is now doomed to pay Joel’s life debt; he did save her life in the first game, after all. So this sequel becomes a revenge story, but by no means a traditional one. Joel is killed by Abby, a completely new character to the series. You soon find out that Abby’s father was killed in the first game during one of Joel’s many seemingly heroic murder sprees. So in the intersecting multi-narrative of The Last of Us Part II, Abby, too, finds herself hellbent on revenge. Because of this two-handed structure, you spend much of the game looking at yourself in the mirror. For the first half of it, you play as Ellie, as she tears through Seattle in search of Abby. When she finally finds Abby, the game stops, turns around, and starts over, forcing you to play through the same few days again, but this time as Abby in search of Ellie. The game tethers these two women together like a Chinese finger trap. Every act of violence you make in the first half becomes an act of self-harm in the second.\nAs you can imagine, this makes the game’s finale, when the two stories finally collide again, thorny as all hell. It’s an eye for an eye for an eye for an eye for an eye, until there are no eyes left, and the two women are laid bare, physically emaciated, and scraped pencil-thin. Only when Ellie and Abby are at their weakest do they understand the futility of revenge. Because, of course, these acts of violence have consequences. And boy, do we see them play out in the frightening epilogue.\nThe Last of Us Part II bears a lot of resemblance to subversive neo-Westerns of the past twenty years. Andrew Dominik’s The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford and Tommy Lee Jones’s The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada come to mind. Those films are fantastic; they’ve stayed with me for years. But this game will probably have a longer-lasting effect. In The Last of Us Part II, instead of just watching these stories, you’re living them. You control these characters. You make their choices. And as a lot of critics have already pointed out, some of the decisions Ellie and Abby are forced to make—that we are forced to make—are miserable. You’re forced to kill a dog, beat a woman to death with a pipe, and in the harrowing final boss battle, quite literally try to kill yourself.\nSo of course I don’t assume that The Last of Us Part II will please everyone. It’s not built to please you; good stories never are. But for this sequel to be anywhere near as impactful as its predecessor, it had to say something new. And the message is clearly heard: In video games, we usually sow violence. It’s about time we reap it, too. That’s as deafening a message as I’ve ever seen in a video game before. It’s powerful enough to make you reassess why it is, exactly, that you love violent video games at all.\nWhen the game ends, after the credits roll and you’re rewarded with a trophy notification and the choice to start over with extra resources and a harder difficulty, that image of the boat appears again. But this time, it’s in the sun. And instead of tossing on uncertain waters, it’s sitting firmly on the shore. After all this blood and carnage, all the stabbing, all the tearing of flesh, all the pain, all the bullet storms, we finally get to see some sunlight again. You realize that the game was not about the murky twilight of our past. Not at all. It was about the choice to step away from the shadows of our dads, to leave their failings six feet under the ground, to let the bright light of a new day—a new story—shine on.",

            "text": "I’ll say this much for The Last of Us: This episode, the show’s second, is a vast improvement over the pilot. Titled “Infected” after the primary source of horror for the whole show and helmed by the core creative team of Craig Mazin and Neil Druckmann, who write and direct respectively, it’s a tighter, fresher, tenser, scarier, grosser, and altogether more vital hour of television than its predecessor. Yes, it’s weighed down by bog-standard post-apocalyptic tough-guy dialogue and the kind of enervated performances that go with that. But its narrow focus on three characters instead of the whole of society, and its inevitable — even predictable — yet still narratively bold climax give it the juice that the show’s opening installment lacked.\nThis ep does have one thing in common with the premiere, though: an opening flashback from a different time and place. In this case it’s Jakarta in 2003, where a professor of mycology is commandeered by the army to diagnose and offer a remedy for what is apparently the first fatal outbreak of the cordyceps infection. Instead, she advises the military to bomb the entire city back to the Stone Age, then asks simply to be brought home to her family.\nWhich is cool, I guess? I dunno, given that we’ve already seen that the entire world is still devastated 20 years after the initial outbreak I’m not sure we needed to spend several minutes of screentime establishing the fact that the infection is in fact very dangerous. But if the show were to open every episode with a flashback, it would give the episodes some consistency and allow the filmmakers to establish the basics of the infection without interrupting the main narrative for huge gobs of exposition. So it’s okay in my book.\nThe rest of the episode, and this is definitely the cool thing about it, stars a grand total of three characters and three characters only: Joel, Tess, and Ellie, trekking through the overrun ruins of Boston in order to exchange the girl for the battery the adults will need to fire up a truck and take it cross country. That’s right: no resistance fighters, no jackbooted security personnel, no working stiffs, no fellow smugglers, not even extras save for the infected. It’s all Pedro Pascal, Anna Torv, and Bella Ramsey, which sets up the unconscious expectation in the audience that if enough of these three characters die, so too will our story. It’s smart filmmaking.\nSmart enough, I think, that it can power through a lot of objections you might have as to the been-there-done-that nature of what they say and do. I’ll state for the record once again that I have not played the Last of Us video games; I’ll state for the record once again that this doesn’t matter, since I’m reviewing a TV show and not the games it’s based on. As such, well, it’s 2023: You’ve seen crumbling cities overrun by vegetation a million times before (Netflix’s Alice in Borderland Season 2 got there just a few weeks ago!). Ditto plant/fungus-based humanoid monsters. Ditto dialogue like “This is your chance, you get her there, you keep her alive, and you set everything right,” which when delivered by an infected and doomed Tess is supposed to come across like a major moment instead of throwaway text from a cutscene. It’s way more the latter than it is the former, I’m afraid.\nAnd given that Tess dies in this episode, committing suicide by explosives in order to prevent a horde of infected from reaching the un-bitten Joel and Ellie, I suppose now’s the time to point out that Anna Torv brings way more to the table than either Pascal or Ramsey in the other two roles. There’s a vicious intensity to her speech, facial expressions, and even body language that the others can’t match. Pascal is entirely too comfortable in this sort of hardbitten hardass role (I’ve enjoyed his work across multiple shows but you’ve gotta admit how much more interesting he was in Game of Thrones, when he was allowed to be horny as well as dangerous).\nAnd I continue to believe that Ramsey was somehow miscast. The writing does her no favors, as mentioned earlier, but there’s something kind of high-school drama-club about her character’s sardonic toughness. I have yet to meet a 14 year old from after armageddon, to be fair, but I like to think they’d be a bit less quippy than this. There’s a stiffness to her performance that elides the possibility of vulnerability until there’s no other choice for her but to bring it forward; the fluid back-and-forth between those poles that you might expect or prefer is simply not there.\nBut it’s commendably bold for a show this huge to scale itself down to a three-hander in its second episode ever. Some of the visuals are impressively disgusting as well, from the zombie-like mushroom-headed “clickers” (everyone who got mad at me on Twitter for having the temerity to suggest that this show is part of the horror genre owes me an apology) to the incredible tendril kiss shared between an infected and Tess right near the end. A repulsive, invasive, perversely intimate visual, it takes this concept about as far as it can go, to its great credit.\nIt would be too generous to say I’m more bullish on The Last of Us than I was last week. The dialogue, the plot, and the bulk of the post-apocalyptic visuals simply aren’t doing anything new, and those are all huge marks against the overall work. But this episode proves that Mazin and Druckmann are both willing and able to innovate, if only sporadically. And that’s where hope for the future of this show will grow, like a, well, you know.\nSean T.

It’s still unbelievable how much of a pop-culture juggernaut it has become since it originally launched for the PS3 back in 2013. Seven years is a long time.\nTo this day, Naughty Dog’s brilliant masterpiece is still widely-regarded not only as one of the best video games in history but also one of the games that’s meant to be a testament to how the medium should be seen as an art form, just as much as movies and music.\nHow can a sequel possibly live up to that? Well, the folks at Naughty Dog have done their damndest to make The Last Of Us Part 2 a worthy successor, and it surely comes close.\nDoes that mean The Last Of Us Part 2 is a bad game? Hell, no. If anything, it could even be considered as one of the best games this generation has had to offer to date.\nThe Last Of Us Part 2 takes place five years after the end of The Last Of Us, which means that we’re treated to an older Ellie and Joel who have settled in the peaceful town of Jackson in Wyoming. While the first game was pretty much the adventures of Ellie and Joel, the second game introduces a bunch of new characters, many of which have been revealed in promotional trailers and material for The Last Of Us Part 2.\nEllie is no longer tied to just Joel for human companionship. She now has friends and potential lovers, like Dina (whom she kisses in the previously-revealed Paris Games Week trailer) and Jesse, the Asian guy who can also be seen in one of the trailers. Things start to become relatively normal for Ellie, until one day when disaster unexpectedly strikes. While I can’t reveal what happens, this tragic event spurs Ellie onto her new journey.\nThe themes being explored in The Last Of Us Part 2 (as previously-revealed by game director Neil Druckmann) are hate and the cycle of violence.\nIn fact, hate is what drives Ellie on her new adventure, and, as a result, the game’s narrative is more complex than the original, where all Ellie and Joel were concerned with was safely reaching the Fireflies to make a potential cure for the Cordyceps virus.\nThings aren’t as clear cut or as black and white in the sequel. Throughout the game, Ellie performs questionable actions and unspeakable acts of violence to achieve her mission. In her mind, the ends justify the means and violence begets violence. The consequences of her actions (and of those closest to her) are real. The lines start to blur, and what happens when you can’t distinguish between good guys and the bad guys?\nIn the original The Last Of Us, it was a matter of survival for Ellie; a kill or be killed situation, but now it’s entirely her own personal and independent choice to pursue these ‘antagonists’ for revenge. I’m not ashamed to say that I sometimes squirmed a little watching the gratuitous and near-realistic violence in The Last Of Us Part 2.\nWhile other current-gen games like Sony Santa Monica’s God Of War also depicted similar levels of violence and blood, that game featured acts of violence against beasts and monsters that don’t exist in real life. In The Last Of Us Part 2, you’ll be killing human beings and even dogs.\nYou can choose not to kill the dogs, but it’s not like the game has a non-lethal option or alternative for stopping them. The violence is visceral and graphic as well; heads get bashed in, and gallons of blood will be spilt. It’s definitely not for the faint-hearted or squeamish.\nThe moral and philosophical conundrums in The Last Of Us Part 2 aren’t exactly subtle, but the game also subverts the idea of conventional protagonist and antagonist roles, twisting these tropes.\nIt’s not hard for me to predict that the narrative choices made by Naughty Dog in this game will likely be extremely divisive to many fans of the original.\nI won’t lie; many fans will probably hate and abhor what Naughty Dog has done with their beloved characters. Heck, I personally have mixed feelings about the story and where they decided to go with the plot myself, but everything ultimately lines up with the inherent themes of the narrative, and in service of it.\nIt gets better once you comprehend that all of these characters are meant to be flawed human beings, even the protagonists Joel and Ellie. Trauma can change even the best of us and in a post-apocalyptic world like in The Last Of Us Part 2, that’s even more truth to that. You know what they say; love and hate are two sides of the same coin.\nHalfway through The Last Of Us Part 2, players should expect a paradigm shift. In fact, the story in The Last Of Us Part 2 benefits from being told from more than one perspective, expanding the game’s narrative beyond just Ellie’s side of the story.\nI’ll just say this: everyone’s a villain in someone else’s story, as you will learn in The Last Of Us Part 2.\nWhat is this paradigm shift, you ask? Well, halfway through the game is when the game thrusts you into the role of another playable character. You will then continue playing as this character (who’s not Ellie) for quite a while, and this isn’t a half-assed attempt from Naughty Dog either. This other playable character plays differently from Ellie, as well as having her/his own unique weapons and skill tree upgrades.\nLet me just tell you that this character change will change the entire game, for an experience that’s more than just Ellie’s story. That’s all I can say without spoiling more, but while you may question why you need to play as this new playable character at first, you’ll later come to understand how important she/he is to the game.\nThe Last Of Us Part 2 also employs various extended (and playable) flashback sequences to fill in the blanks of its narrative. The player will learn about stuff that happened in the past, and understand how they affect the present (or future). For the purpose of this review (and coverage of this game), I’ve actually played almost two playthroughs of the game (the first playthrough took me almost 27 hours), after which I realized several things that I could only have learned after doing so.\nIt was only after two playthroughs that I realized that there were moments that foreshadowed future events sprinkled throughout the game, and certain details that you’ll only notice in subsequent playthroughs.\nOh, and yes, The Last Of Us Part 2 does have a New Game Plus mode, where all weapons, equipment and unlocked skills/abilities will carry over.\nHowever, I do have one complaint; sometimes the flashbacks will happen at odd times, breaking the pacing and momentum of the game. The reason for this is because these flashbacks can be quite lengthy to complete.\nThis means that you’ll sometimes be taken from the heat of the current moment to delve into an entire flashback chapter from the past. Don’t get me wrong though; these flashbacks contain some of the best and most memorable moments in The Last Of Us Part 2, but they do sometimes break the flow of the game.\nThere’s even a point in the game where, as it reaches the climax (a pretty pivotal moment at that), players are suddenly yanked into a flashback. This is actually when that aforementioned ‘paradigm shift’ officially begins, but it’s still a jarring and bizarre choice on the developer’s part nonetheless.\nIt’s like reaching a cliffhanger or getting the ‘To Be Continued’ screen when watching a TV series, and we all know how frustrating that can be.\nIts story notwithstanding; where The Last Of Us Part 2 shines the most is its gameplay. While not really innovative or revolutionary, the new mechanics introduced in the sequel somehow manages to improve the already tight and polished stealth, shooting and third-person action mechanics in the original The Last Of Us.\nNaughty Dog started experimenting with semi-open world hubs with 2016’s Uncharted 4: A Thief’s End and 2017’s Uncharted: The Lost Legacy. These segments allow for more non-linear exploration in a slighter bigger setting than the usually straightforward progression and setpieces that the developer is best known for in previous games.\nThe Seattle hub (which can be seen in the promotional trailers) is the biggest and most ambitious one yet in a Naughty Dog game. I spent perhaps a good two hours or so in that area alone, and what’s surprising is that a lot of it is actually skippable. Yeah, you can go straight to accomplishing the objective if you don’t feel like exploring.\nHowever, that would be a total waste, considering the wealth of optional and missable cutscenes and missions that there are waiting for players who take the time to explore every nook and cranny.\nThese missable story sequences are often personal and light-hearted character moments, giving players a break from all the violence and killing.\nFor example, when I entered a music shop in the Seattle hub, I was rewarded with one of the game’s most memorable highlights which I’m sure will be shared to death on social media when the game eventually comes out.\nIf you’ve seen the new TV commercial for The Last Of Us Part 2, you’ll notice that Ellie plays the guitar and sings to Dina. Well, in this amazing sequence, she does the same thing, but I won’t spoil what the song is. You’ll definitely be pleasantly surprised.\nMost of the core gameplay from 2013’s The Last Of Us have remained intact, albeit with several new mechanics and quality-of-life improvements, all of which feel like their natural evolution into the realm of current-gen gaming, while retaining its gritty and grounded elements.\nRunning away from combat is a viable option in The Last Of Us Part 2, allowing players to rethink their combat strategies on the fly and reestablish stealth again. This is great for guerilla (hit and run) tactics or if you tend to make mistakes during stealth.\nWhat really makes a huge amount of difference this time around is how much more mobile and smoother the combat is. Unlike Joel in The Last Of Us, The Last Of Us Part 2‘s Ellie is significantly more agile.\nThis new agility owes itself to the new dodge mechanic, which was also weirdly something that was also newly-introduced in Capcom’s Resident Evil 3 Remake earlier this year.\nIs this going to be a trend now? If so, I welcome it.\nPlayers dodge by simply pressing the L1 button and moving the analogue stick in the direction they want to go. It’s pretty intuitive and forgiving in terms of having to time your responses, as the dodge timing window is quite generous. Due to that, spamming the dodge button will only lead to you getting killed faster.\nThe dodge mechanic is versatile in that it can be used to even dodge bullets (if you time it right, she’s not The Flash) and get to cover faster.\nIt feels wonderful to play when you’ve gotten a steady rhythm of knowing when to dodge and attack, especially during melee fights. It’s like the late Muhammad Ali said; “Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee”.\nEven playing at normal difficulty, resources (especially ammo and materials for crafting) can be hard to come by, despite the fact that I took my time exploring, scouring and scavenging. Resorting to melee never feels like a chore or a hassle, and I find myself favouring stealth and melee over using ranged weapons. Except when I’m fighting the Infected, of course. Melee-ing a Clicker or Shambler is an instant death sentence.\nAnother mechanic that lends further to the increased agility during combat and gameplay is the new dedicated jump button, which means there are now actual platforming sections in the game (and swinging from ropes).\nYou don’t have to worry about Ellie suddenly turning into Nathan Drake or Chloe Frazer 2.0, because she’s a lot less agile than those two slick adventurers. I actually fell to my death a couple of times; it was hilarious.\nThat said, The Last Of Us Part 2 does feature a lot of that one Uncharted series trope; the one where jumping to a fragile ledge or whatever will result in a sudden anxiety-inducing jump-scare when it conveniently crumbles at that exact moment. In The Last Of Us Part 2, that also happens to floors, so expect falling through floors to be a random but strangely-common occurrence.\nIn 2013’s The Last Of Us, players could crouch, but that’s all they could do, which means that stealth options were more limited. In The Last Of Us Part 2, Ellie can go prone (lie face down on her belly to avoid detection) and even move while in that position. This expands and enhances the game’s stealth gameplay. Now Ellie can hide in tall grass, underneath certain vehicles and other hiding places. From these hiding places, Ellie can ambush enemies or just shoot them,\nI’ve even cheesed the combat in the game by following that strategy. Find some tall grass, go prone, and shoot my silenced pistol or bow and arrow. Most of the times, I could kill a number of enemies in the area by doing that and waiting for them to come near my position, as I lay there undetected. Well, unless they have dogs, that is.\nWith all the new movement options available, traversal options in The Last Of Us Part 2 have also been expanded to include more horse-riding and even boats. Riding horses feel similar to how they do in 2018’s Red Dead Redemption 2 (with weight factoring in and realistic movements), but the boats actually feel clunky to move around in.\nThat may be realistic, but I found it to be a chore every time I have to ride a boat. Thankfully, the boat segments are few and far in between, except for one segment. Thankfully, you’ll be doing a lot more swimming than riding boats.\nNaughty Dog initially made a ridiculously big deal about how this game will feature dogs as enemies, as if it’s such a revolutionary new concept when many games before The Last Of Us Part 2 have already featured the same thing. Still, that doesn’t mean that the dogs in The Last Of Us Part 2 are any less annoying to fight, as dog enemies in games often are.\nThey can smell and track Ellie’s scent, but it’s actually not hard to trick them into losing her scent trail. The unique animation for physically killing dogs is quite brutal and disconcerting, as you hear their final whines before they drop dead from your stabbings.\nYes, that’s how you kill dogs if you attack them with melee, since Ellie uses a switchblade by default.\nUnlike other stealth games, there are no non-lethal combat options in The Last Of Us Part 2, so you either kill the dogs or avoid them through stealth, which would make the game unnecessarily and frustratingly harder for no reason. Oh, and unlike the Resident Evil games or most other games, these aren’t zombie dogs or mutant dogs; simply regular and angry dogs.\nThe Listen Mode makes a triumphant return here, allowing Ellie to use her heightened sense of hearing and spatial awareness to more effectively locate enemies, strangely enough (since she’s not supposed to be superhuman in any way), even behind walls and from a distance. Gamers who decry this mechanic and accuse it of breaking the game’s immersion can simply choose not to use it, but it’s still there for the player’s convenience.\nAs for weapons, Ellie will have access to a 9mm pistol and hunting rifle at the beginning of the game, while the rest are optional and must be found while exploring the world. These include returning weapons like a shotgun, bow and arrow (you can even craft explosive arrows), a revolver, and a variety of craftable items like molotovs and smoke bombs. There are also various (breakable) melee weapons like hammers, machetes, and more.\nThere are actually more weapons, but I can’t reveal what they are without spoiling anything. What I can say is that they all pack the same satisfying punch and feel distinctive enough from each other during combat. They can all be upgraded at workbenches strewn throughout the game, and players can look forward to intricate unique animations for every single upgrade.\nFor instance, you’ll see Ellie adding and attaching an actual scope to the hunting rifle when you purchase that upgrade using Parts (the resource required), or you’ll see her disassembling the weapons and tinkering with them when you purchase the upgrade for less Recoil or more Stability.\nPlayers will also have to actively search for Training Manuals, which will unlock brand new skill trees for Ellie to learn new abilities and passive skills. Some of these are more helpful than others, such as faster movement when crouching and going prone. Some help you conserve materials by allowing you to craft more ammo and items from fewer amount of materials.\nAs for enemy types, there are two new types of Infected; the acid-spraying Shambler and the Stalkers, who travel in packs and use annoying hit and run tactics.\nThese new Infected are interesting to fight because Listen Mode doesn’t work on Stalkers, so you’ll have to stalk them the old-fashioned way, while it’s important to keep a safe distance from Shamblers, which means that players have to stay mobile at all times.\nItâ€™s already been previously established that there are several factions in The Last Of Us Part 2, including the militia group Washington Liberation Front (WLF) and the cult-like Seraphites or Scars. Unlike the conventional militia troopers of the WLF, the Scars communicate with each other not by speaking, but instead by whistling as if theyâ€™re descended from dolphins.\nImagine getting stalked by a bunch of fanatical weirdos who whistle to signal their friends, like theyâ€™re aliens from outer space. These enemies also use bow and arrows, which can get lodged in Ellie’s flesh and inflict continuous damage over time.\nPlayers need to press and hold the R1 button to pull it out, though this rarely happens (only once or twice in my playthrough). Still, the first time will likely have you flinching.\nThese different factions are a result of extreme tribalism, which is commonly explored in post-apocalyptic stores like The Last Of Us Part 2. We only saw glimpses of that in the original The Last Of Us, like that group of cannibals. It’s terrifying to what extent people are willing to kill for their beliefs and tribalistic tendencies. People can be more vicious than the Infected.\nDespite all the gameplay improvements, I would have liked the AI to have been smarter. For all the talk of enemies calling out the names of their fallen comrades, they behave just like enemies in any other game, and are not particularly smart either. I’ve cheesed a lot of them simply by avoiding detection by hiding in tall grass or elevated positions, but they still couldn’t pinpoint my exact location.\nShould I really care if I know the names of the enemies I kill? Not really; plenty of other games have done the same thing. It’s sometimes even somewhat comical when enemies scream out the name of their dead partners in such a melodramatic fashion. I’m sure that wasn’t the intended effect, but it is what it is.\nLet’s not mince words; it’s Naughty Dog and we’ve come to expect sky-high standards for graphics and visuals from the developer over the years. Say what you want about the story or gameplay but it’s undeniable that the graphics and visuals in The Last Of Us Part 2 are some of the best I’ve ever seen.\nThe entire game looks downright gorgeous, with character models looking well-detailed and featuring lush environments. The lighting effects in The Last Of Us Part 2 is a huge improvement over the last-gen The Last Of Us, which is expected considering how great these aspects were in recent Uncharted games as well.\nThat being said, the cherry on top of it all and the crowning achievement of The Last Of Us Part 2 are the facial expressions. These are award-winning motion-capture on Andy Serkis’ level, the likes of which is an incredible sight to behold.\nI’ve seen only a few games that have been able to render such detailed facial expressions.\nOf course, the out-of-this-world facial expressions are necessary for the game’s emotional narrative to be fully-realized. Just like Sony Santa Monica’s God Of War or even Naughty Dog’s own recent Uncharted titles, motion-capture in gaming has come a long way. They bring considerable emotional heft and value to these games, and none more so than The Last Of Us Part 2 (though you should expect a lot of grimacing and serious faces for the most part).\nIf you’re wondering, The Last Of Us Part 2 will have a Photo Mode at launch, and it’s a fun feature that accentuates the beautiful visuals. There are multitudes of breathtaking views throughout the game, from lush green vistas to overgrown cityscapes, but my guilty pleasure is capturing the most violent moments in Photo Mode, like when I’m stabbing an enemy or even during cutscenes (don’t judge me, you’ll be doing that too).\nAccessibility in games is more than just subtitles, larger fonts, or colour-blind options. More and more developers are realizing that adding more accessibility options for those less-inclined to vigorous gaming or to accommodate disabled gamers. In The Last Of Us Part 2, there are 60 different accessibility options in the gameâ€™s menu.\nThese cover aspects from controls, visual aids, audio clues, and navigation to traversal and combat. While some are standard features, other elements are game-changing to allow everyone to be able to play the game. Those with sight disabilities can utilize the text-to-speech option that reads out everything in the game, including menus and the notes Ellie picks up on her journey, as well as even audio cues that indicate nearby items or climbable ledges.\nA new high-contrast mode changes the visuals entirely for low-vision players or those who have difficulty distinguishing between different character models. This renders the world in The Last Of Us Part 2 a light grey while turning allies blue and enemies red. In addition, players can also fully remap the controls,\nIn particular, I appreciate the options to change button prompts from having to tap them repeatedly to just holding them down. It’s not that I can’t tap buttons, but holding them down is a better alternative for me, and I’m glad to see it available as an option.\nThe Last Of Us Part 2 is not a relaxing game, nor is it something that you’d play to release stress. It’s an emotionally-exhausting, and even traumatising, game. One that will likely make you angry (or sad) on more than one occasion. That’s not to say that there aren’t moments to make you happy or cry, but they’re often fleeting, just like in real life.\nIf you’re looking for a relatively happier and more light-hearted experience, I suggest replaying any of Naughty Dog’s Uncharted games. But if you’re ready for the thrilling ride that is The Last Of Us Part 2, all I can say is: brace yourself.\nWill The Last Of Us Part 2 be as iconic as the original The Last Of Us? I don’t think so, but I’ll be damned if it’s not a great game in its own right.\nStill, to answer the question, I personally think that The Last Of Us Part 2 is a better game in almost every aspect (gameplay and graphics, especially) compared to its predecessor.\nYou’ll notice that I said “almost”, because I still like and prefer the story and narrative in the original The Last Of Us than its sequel.\nHow you ultimately feel about the game will depend on whether you’ll like The Last Of Us Part 2‘s narrative choices. Like I said before, this game will split fans and gamers into radically different and divisive camps, which I expect will happen when it’s out 19th June.\nTrust me on this.\nThe Last Of Us Part 2 was reviewed on a PS4 Pro via a review copy courtesy of PlayStation Asia.\nBy Alleef Ashaari|March 11, 2021\nTotal Mayhem Games has announced We Were Here Forever, the latest game in the co-op adventure puzzle franchise.

            "text": "(This review of “The Last of Us Part 2” is free of any story spoilers)\nFor a long stretch in the middle of “The Last of Us Part 2” it felt like Naughty Dog, the studio that created the series, had found its rhythm. The story really starts to move, the character interactions work really well, and the completely unnecessary crafting mechanics stop feeling so intrusive. For a couple hours, I thought that maybe this was one of those rare times when a sequel to a beloved game is actually a meaningful improvement over its predecessor.\nBut that feeling didn’t last. Shortly after I started having all those positive thoughts, the game took a turn that was so ineffective from a storytelling perspective, and so annoying from a gameplay perspective, that I no longer wanted to play it. And that’s the story of my experience with “The Last of Us Part 2.”\nIt’s more or less impossible to sell you on what my issue was without sharing spoilers or going into other details that Sony asked critics to not discuss before the game is out. But just know that this is a game that simply refuses to be what it should be. What it so desperately wants to be. It trips over its own feet at every opportunity.\nAlso Read: 'Uncharted 4: A Thief's End' Review: One Final Step Back for the Disappointing Franchise\n“The Last of Us Part 2,” as you no doubt are aware, is the follow-up to the 2013 original that was set amid a zombie apocalypse in which the zombies are humans infected with a brain-destroying fungus, and middle-aged Joel (Troy Baker) has to safeguard a teen girl, Ellie (Ashley Johnson) during a journey across the country. The reason for that journey: Ellie is immune to the zombie plague, and some folks are hoping to develop a cure or vaccine from her blood. But it turned out that the procedure required to develop a medical defense would kill Ellie. So Joel reclaimed Ellie and killed so many still-living people on his way out.\nThis sequel picks up five years later, with Joel and Ellie living in an enclave in Jackson, Wyoming. Some folks from out of town show up, cause a very dramatic stir, and the setting moves to Seattle, where our heroes stumble into a war between a pair of huge local factions.\n“The Last of Us” was hailed by many back in 2013 as a landmark of video gaming as storytelling. I take issue with that somewhat — it was too much of a video game to be a narrative heavyweight to anyone who isn’t a gamer. Joel and Ellie were compelling characters to build the story around, but the story itself is pretty standard stuff delivered in a pretty standard way.\nAlso Read: 'Grand Theft Auto 5,' 'Hitman 3,' Among Planned PS5 Game Releases\n“The Last of Us Part 2” isn’t any different in that regard. The characters are good, and the story is fine. I’ve watched ten seasons of “The Walking Dead” at this point, okay, and this game really just feels like it could have been another season of that show. This is not a story that really even tries to separate itself from the zombie story template that we’re so used to.\n“Actually, the real monsters are people” is a joke I’ve made innumerable times over the past seven years because it’s a trope that writers in fiction media continue to exploit over and over again. “The Last of Us Part 2” might be the pinnacle of the cliche, going so hard on it for so long it that I thought I was losing my mind.\nThis game is already extraordinarily long for a title like this, and much longer than any of Naughty Dog’s “Uncharted” games or the first “Last of Us.” That in itself is an issue, because the story isn’t dense enough to support that length. But even worse is that it’s only as long as it is because director Neil Druckmann and co. delivered the most exhausting “actually, the real monsters are people” screed that I’ve ever experienced. Every aspect of this pointlessly long story is built around it.\nAlso Read: Everything to Know About the New PlayStation 5 Console\nFurther padding the length is the crafting mechanics — everywhere you go, you’ll spend a few moments scouring the room for stuff you can use to make med kits or molotov cocktails or whatever, because if you don’t then you’re gonna have an extra difficult time getting through your encounters with baddies. And even when you’re in a part of the story where there’s a time crunch, you’ll have to keep doing this, because scrounging crafting ingredients is as much of a core element as stealthily stabbing zombies is.\nThat’s a bad thing, but it’s the kind of thing I was referring to above when I said that the first game was too much of a video game to work all that well as a piece of storytelling. The video game stuff in “The Last of Us Part 2” gets in the way of the storytelling stuff. This has been an issue for decades for this medium, and Naughty Dog has done nothing to address that fundamental flaw here.\nWith the story also refusing to get out of its own way thanks to its obsession with the most common of zombie tropes, I can’t help but conclude that “The Last of Us Part 2” is a worse experience than the original game in every way that truly matters to me. Sure, they ironed out some of the gameplay to make it a smoother experience, but that doesn’t even begin to make up for its major missteps.\nSo, yeah, “The Last of Us Part 2” delivers a solid stealth/action experience. It’s got characters I like and care about. And it looks really, really nice. But lots of games have a solid gameplay experience and good characters and pretty graphics.\n“The Last of Us Part 2” is supposed to be more than that. And it isn’t.\n“The Last of Us Part 2” will be released exclusively for the PlayStation 4 on June 19.",

            "text": "“The Last of Us Part II is a gut punch in the best way.”\n- Deep emotional impact\n- Well-written narrative\n- Stunning visuals\n- Fine-tuned gameplay mechanics\n- Characters are fully developed and believable\n- High level of detail in-game and in options\n- Gating inhibits more full exploration\nReleasing a follow-up to a deeply beloved game is daunting and can easily leave fans disappointed. The Last of Us Part II pulls the feat off effortlessly.\nThis sequel expands on what was already a well-crafted story and perfects it. It does the first release justice, expanding on the original without straying too far, which could alienate fans hoping to get a taste of what they loved the first time around. If you haven’t experienced the original check it out at the link below.\nThe Last of Us weighs heavily on this entry, as the ramifications of Joel’s actions have sprawling effects, and history does not go unforgotten. Ellie and Joel have made a new life in Jackson, Wyoming, but the game lets players know that moving on isn’t so simple.\nThe plot is certainly dark, but it never feels edgy. There’s a sense of empathy even for your enemies. Obviously, the game packs plenty of unexpected twists that make The Last of Us Part II feel emotionally and narratively polished. There are Easter eggs and quippy jokes, but this is a revenge story. That is never forgotten.\nEmotional impact\nThe Last of Us was lauded for its emotional narrative that left players reeling, and Naughty Dog’s sequel finds a way to expand on that. The Last of Us Part II is a gut punch in the best way.\nI can’t count the number of times I stared wide-eyed at the screen, thinking, “No. That can’t be right. That can’t be how this goes.”\nPlayers of the first game already know and love Ellie, so it’s easy to buy into her story. That said, this not a happy tale. Fans likely expect that, since Sony referred to the plot as one of a quest for vengeance. But The Last of Us Part II takes many dark turns. It twists, mangling your expectations and, with it, your sense of comfort.\nI can’t count the number of times I stared wide-eyed at the screen, thinking, “No. That can’t be right. That can’t be how this goes.”\nAnd while I thought I knew Ellie, playing the game feels like running into an old friend I grew apart from. Sure, that’s her — but she’s older, and her attitude has grown from a spunky, tough kid to a jaded survivor.\nEllie is still fiercely loyal and fearless, but she’s lost the hope she had in the first game. That’s likely because, in the original, Ellie was on her way to helping to find a cure. It’s clear the failure of that mission took a piece of her optimism and growing up in a post-apocalyptic world while still dealing with the torturous pressures of being a teenager hasn’t helped.\nWe see her coming out story and her anguish over telling Joel about her first girlfriend. This narrative piece is especially beautiful, and I was glad to see Ellie’s feelings explored with the same sincerity as a heterosexual relationship.\nHer relationship with Joel deepens, too, as they create a new life after the events of the first game. There’s a flashback to one of her birthdays, and the time they spend bonding is a potent reminder that family isn’t just made up of blood relatives.\nStill, Ellie is older. She has questions, and she already wasn’t one to shy away from questioning authority. And after her and Joel’s failed vaccine quest, seeing people turn from a bite becomes more difficult.\nAt times, Ellie is unrecognizable, even to herself.\nThe event that sets Ellie off to seek revenge takes even more from her.\nAt times, our protagonist is unrecognizable, even to herself. Watching her journey — actively taking part but unable to change course — is painful. The writing makes The Last of Us Part II one of the greatest gaming experiences I’ve ever had. It reminds me of the games that my mom, who really did not understand my fascination with video games, would look over my shoulder to watch. The ones that got her to stop asking, “Aren’t you tired of playing that?” and instead sit down next to me. That got her to comment to my stepdad quietly, “It’s like a movie.”\nMuch like the first The Last of Us, the narrative will remind players why they love to play and birth a new generation of gamers.\nWhile Ellie is the star, the story does extend beyond her. I was swept up in the lives of characters I would never meet, some dead, some still out there somewhere. You’ll find documents and mementos, much like in the last game. But this time, the game does a better job of creating stories that can last the span of the game. One document in an early area connects to one in a later level. A person mentioned in one note is the writer of another. And in the times when I came across an unseen character’s final note near their body, or worse, in a room with an infected, I was heartbroken.\nIt’s been teased that Part II is darker, but I wasn’t prepared.\nAgain, this goes beyond Ellie. The world is at war with itself. Differing factions suffer on both sides following the dissipation of a truce, one that neither party takes blame for. There’s also the profound, moral question of which side is the right side. People previously aligned with the government-sanctioned FEDRA, the counter-movement of the Fireflies, or opted to answer only for themselves. But this isn’t just about survival. It’s about what society looks like as the remains of human civilization try desperately to hang on.\nWhen you kill a human enemy, their friends will cry out for them. They each have names. Their allies will be devastated to come across their dead body, and not because it means they themselves are in danger. It’s a heartwrenching, but realistic, detail, and it makes the game shine while leaving you with a pit in your stomach.\nGameplay\nExpanding the game to include so many elements means opening up the map. Although not truly an open-world game, some levels are large and complex, and exploring them is absolutely worth your time.\nWhen it comes to game mechanics, it doesn’t fix what isn’t broken.\nI was delighted to come across Easter eggs, unravel a story through notes left behind and clues, or find an especially handy equipment pickup by going out of my way.\nThere are also small moments that trigger cutscenes, and appear entirely optional. Some bits were just cute, but others added a deep emotional layer. I highly suggest checking everything out, and I’ll likely set out on another completionist run myself.\nStill, The Last of Us Part II is a linear game, and gating — where you’re prevented from going back to a previous area — removes any illusion this could be a true sandbox title.\nWhen it comes to game mechanics, it doesn’t fix what isn’t broken. It operates much like the first game but fine-tunes combat. Stealth gets smarter, there are new enemies, and there are ability trees you can invest resources into depending on your preferred fighting style. I found it easy to jump back in and appreciated the new elements.\nVisuals and details\nThe visuals of The Last of Us Part II are, quite simply, magnificent. The detail of the environment and objects are absolutely phenomenal. I played on a base PlayStation 4 with HDR on, and I was floored that I wasn’t playing in 4K. It really looks that good. Textures look exceptionally detailed, and landscapes look incredible. This is particularly important given the amount of time spent outside.\nThe character detailing might be even more impressive. There’s a small part where Ellie looks in the mirror making different faces, and it’s not a cutscene. The animations look so good, it feels like the developers are showing off.\nIt would, of course, be remiss not to mention the crunch that went into this game. Naughty Dog has received criticism over its practice of making its team put in grueling hours to complete this and other games. It’s an absolute shame that anyone would work under those conditions, and they are the unsung heroes that made this game as good as it is.\nThey’ve included so many intricacies to be explored. The options menu allows you to individually customize the difficulty of things like enemy health or the number of resources you’ll find.\nMore importantly, players can change the controls to make it more accessible in a variety of ways. Visually, changes can be made to make subtitles easier to read or to see important details. There’s also a text-to-speech option and motion sickness settings. Players can even change how to play the guitar or operate a boat. These options are also made apparent with on-screen notifications, and other accessibility options are made known at the start. It’s a great move that I hope to see in more titles.\nAll these details make The Last of Us Part II an incredibly powerful game.\nOur take\nThe Last of Part II is a tour de force that takes the best parts of the original and molds them into their finest forms. The story will leave you reeling, and there are several unexpected turns that will keep you invested throughout. The level of detail and quality in the world creation and story building are at the top of their class.\nIs there a better alternative?\nThere isn’t anything quite like The Last of Us Part II, let alone a better alternative. The gameplay and combat aren’t unique, but the story that takes place around those elements is singular. It’s also why people bought into the first game so heavily.\nHow long will it last?\nThe campaign takes anywhere from 30 to 40 hours, easily reaching the latter if you’re keen on exploring and finding everything available. If you just want to get through the story, 30 hours is closer to accurate, but even narrative-driven players will benefit from some extra exploration.\nShould you but it?\nYes, absolutely. The Last of Us Part II will go down as a classic game that people talk about for years to come, not unlike the first iteration. The fact that this title expands so much on what worked well makes it that much easier to justify adding it to your library.\nEditors' Recommendations\n- The Last of Us finale makes a subtle change from the game to set up season 2\n- New art for The Last of Us multiplayer spinoff teases its seaside setting\n- The Last of Us Part 1: All Training Manual locations\n- The Last of Us Part I beginner’s guide: 9 tips and tricks to get started\n- The Last Of Us Part I haptic dialogue feedback enhances accessibility",

            "text": "Apart from the hero’s journey-cum-quest narrative that doubtless will occupy much of The Last Of Us this season, creators Craig Mazin and Neil Druckmann are bound to keep doling out back story as to how this fungal apocalypse began. And thus the second episode cold open takes us to Jakarta, Indonesia in 2003, a short time before the outbreak went global.\nA middle-aged woman’s afternoon lunch (beef satay!) is interrupted by a pair of cops who escort her to a car. The dignified lady is assured she has not committed a crime. They confirm she is Ibu Ratna (Christine Hakim) professor of mycology at University of Indonesia. Ah yes, the unwitting scientist dragged in by government officials because some Weird Shit Is Going Down, a beloved and necessary trope for end-of-the-world narratives.\nDr Ratna is taken to a lab, squints at a sample of the fungus Ophiocordyceps through the microscope and is told it was taken from a human. She knows (and we know from the last episode’s cold open) the fungus can’t live in the heat of the human body. She then examines the corpse it was taken from, and extracts white, writhing tendrils from deep in the throat. The female subject, shot through the head by police, had been bitten on the ankle and subsequently bit a few coworkers. Who are all now executed. Where did they all work? A flour and grain processing factory. Dr. Ratna puts it all together in a tense debrief with a military official (Yayu A.W. Unru). Clearly a fast-spreading mycotic (fungus-to-human) event has occurred. The good doctor’s terse advice: Bomb the city and everyone in it.\nA superior shooter for less\nImagine shooting smooth, high-resolution QFHD 4K 24p/30p videos and crisp FHD at 60p, all with the convenience and ease of a compact camera. What sets the G100 apart, aside from its great picture, is its user-friendly features. Plus, it’s super compact and lightweight even with a lens attached.\nLet’s pause a moment and consider, in a fit of wildly premature speculation, where The Last Of Us is ultimately headed. Yes, it’s a zombie-adjacent survival epic with a grieving-father-surrogate-daughter emotional through-line. Yes, it’s a narrative pretext for chases, gunplay, gore, heroism and horror. But where’s it going to leave us after season two or three, after the game’s 2020 sequel has been digested in another 18 or so breathless installments?\nMy money’s on: Humans lose. Joel and Ellie (or whoever replaces them) put up a good fight, they maintain their dignity and ethics, and die of natural causes—maybe because both are immune? In any case, humanity becomes extinct. The fungus flourishes. The Anthropocene ends, and nature begins to heal. That’s what I posit as Mazin-Druckmann’s long game: it’s the end of the world and we feel fine. All the gross stuff with undead cannibals and gruesome Clickers and so forth? All a beautiful part of Gaia’s epic reset. No demons. No aliens. No God. Just fungus and root systems and a happy planet for the next few billion years. Posthuman cli fi in Romero drag.\nOkay, back to the zombie blasting! Post-credits (Game Of Thrones meets Time-Lapse Mold) we see Ellie (Bella Ramsey) curled up in fetal position, on the floor of a house overgrown with grass and weeds. Her bed is a mossy green patch and light streams down from the busted roof. It’s a pretty pastoral image of rewilding nature (the episode was deftly directed by Druckmann).\nJoel (Pedro Pascal) and Tess (Anna Torv), now that they know that Ellie has been bitten, have keeping watch over Ellie, guns out, all night. Exasperated, Ellie points out that she hasn’t turned into a “fucking monster.” Joel, with possibly fractured fingers from pummeling the soldier to pulp last night, is still on high alert. Tess argues they push on, bring Ellie to the State House and get the car battery and other booty from the Fireflies. Joel wants to return the girl to the Quarantine Zone (QZ) and continue without her. Neither knows what’s so special about this girl.\nWhich seems a bit improbable. You don’t have to be a mycology professor or epidemiologist to know that if a person appears to be immune to an insanely infectious agent, they are of humongous scientific value. But okay, years in the smuggling racket have hardened Joel and Tess beyond normal reason. At any rate, Ellie has to explain that there’s a Firefly camp out west with scientists who are trying to create a vaccine and the need to study her immune system. Joel scoffs that he’s heard about miracle cures for years. But Tess wins out: whether or not the girl is for real, the Fireflies think so, and they need the gear. They head out.\nThe bulk of the episode that follows is a trek-and-fight through the bombed out, cantilevered wreckage of downtown Boston, buildings Tower-of-Pisa’ed into crazy angles and festooned in miles of moss, vines, and ferns. Shoutout to cinematographer Ksenia Sereda, production designer John Paino, and a reported squad of art directors for engineering such a haunting, painterly Beantown Without Us (Tarkovsky’s unforgettable Stalker was easily in the image library).\nAs they walk in daylight through the open city, no infected around, Tess asks Ellie questions: age, family, how she got bitten. Ellie in turn marvels at the lack of infecteds and asks about some of the beasties we are sure to encounter: super-infecteds who spew spores, and ones with burst-open heads who lurk in the shadows.\nThe trio enters the lobby of a semi-submerged grand hotel (cue random frog plonking keys on a piano as it leaps away). They wade through the green mucky water. Ten floors up, they find a collapsed mass of concrete that bars the way forward. Tess clambers over it to scout the way, leaving Ellie and Joel to get to know each other, a bit of human interaction that goes nowhere fast. She learns he’s from Austin, Tess is from Detroit, the infecteds can live for a month or 20 years, and he’s killed lots of them. When the girl asks about the soldier last night, Joel can’t find it in himself to say, He triggered a memory of my daughter being shot when she was your age. But I hope Pascal gets to act that highly emotional scene in a later episode.\nTess reappears through a side door and guides them on an alternate route. From the rooftop, they look down and see scores of undead prone in the street, groaning and writhing. Tess has a short speech about how the fungus isn’t only in the infected, but growing underground (“long fibers like wires, some of them stretching over a mile”), creating a network in which all the infected are connected and sharing information. (This mycorrhizal framing of zombies reinforces the deep-ecology theory of Last Of Us; they are of the Earth, whereas humans are the mutation.)\nTheir way blocked by Sleeping Uglies, Joel and Tess take Ellie to the museum. Here’s the haunted house part of the episode. They walk tensely through the creepy place by flashlight, find a dead body. Joel mime-orders that they’ll continue in total silence. Very creepy climb up a staircase. Don’t touch the ‘shrooms, Joel! We are so ready for a Clicker to appear.\nAnd one obliges. The three are stopped in their tracks (after a sudden collapse that conveniently occurs after they get through a doorway) by the sound a strangulated glottal cackle coming from a hallway. The raspy ghoul enters the room, stalking around glass display cases. Joel signals to Ellie to be totally silent; they are drawn by sound. But when Ellie gets a glimpse of the thing, with its braised-cauliflower head, she gasps and it pounces with a scream. Joel fights off the creature. The noise draws a second fried artichoke, and Tess and Ellie get separated.\nThe Steadicam work in the ensuing sequence is quite effective, controlling how much we see the Clickers, making use of wildly swinging flashlights and panicked bodies in motion. Joel steers Ellie to safety; wastes a Clicker before it can French kiss him with its mycelium tendrils; Tess buries an axe in the head of another that Joel finishes off with a few bullets. (Clickers can take more rounds before dropping.) Ellie was scratched or bitten on the arm—again—but she’ll survive. Tess, on the other hand, looks stricken.\nOur group gets to the roof of the museum, makes their way across a rickety looking plank bridge to the next building, and continue on their way to the gold-domed state house. When they actually get there, they find the bloodied bodies of numerous Fireflies in the lobby. What happened? Joel reads the scene and deduces that one got bit and the infected and healthy killed each other in firefight. Tess frantically searches through the Firefly supplies for anything they can use: a radio, a map. Joel shouts at Tess it’s over; they should go home. Tess refuses. “I’m staying,” she says. “Our luck had to run out sooner or later.” That’s when Ellie realizes the truth. “Fuck,” the girl says. “She’s infected.”\nSomewhere during the fight in the museum, Tess was bitten. Joel demands to see it. Tess shows a nasty, livid infection on her neck and shoulder. “Whoops, right?” she jokes (same as the game, btw). Just then we see tendrils on the mossy ground, like parasitical worms, stretch out and burrow under the skin of dead men’s fingers. The fungus is waking up the infected (which we saw earlier having a nap), giving them a boost of vitamin Cordyceps. Untold dozens of the flesh-eaters leap up and start running toward the state house.\nTess doesn’t have much time. She tells Joel to promise to get the girl to Bill and Franks. Tess then dumps several barrels of gasoline in the lobby, scatters some hand grenades on the floor, and commands Joel: “Save who you can save.” Joel pulls Ellie away, who protests and curses him for leaving Tess behind. Tess makes a heroic last stand against the marauding undead mob, finally igniting a zippo and blowing up the state house, mid-tendril kiss with a Clicker. Joel and Ellie, a safe distance from the Capitol, see the conflagration, register the loss of a comrade, and keep going.\nThe episode’s emotional arc among the three characters goes something like: hostile mutual mistrust melts incrementally into wary allegiance. Tess, like a friendly aunt, made the earliest overtures to Ellie by way of bonding, while Joel remained stony and silent on the outside. Once Tess is bitten, she can’t afford to deepen any emotional attachment to the girl. Joel’s raw grief over losing Tess can convert either to bitter resentment toward Ellie, or a fresh sense of paternal responsibility. Or an anguished meld of both. When and if Joel allows himself to feel for Ellie as he did for Sarah, it’s going to be explosive stuff.\nAnd so, another fine episode in which the world-building emerges organically and persuasively, the visuals and acting continue to be top-notch, the tension builds to a bloom of satisfying violence. Still unclear whether the series is slickly repackaged horror tropes or a deeply philosophical (forgive the term) game-changer. But we’re in no hurry to find out.\nStray observations\n- Last recap, I included a full disclosure that I’m not a gamer and never played the Naughty Dog version of The Last Of Us. However, research was conducted over here, for those with ten hours to kill.\n- In the previous episode’s extended prologue set in 2003, Joel, Tommy and Sarah were having breakfast when a news report came on the radio about an emergency in Jakarta.\n- Ellie waking up on the ground is an elegant call-back to Sarah waking in bed up at 2am when the outbreak hits Austin.\n- As someone from New Hampshire who has lived in New York a long time I must say, Boston has never looked so livable.\n- The Last Of Us is the furthest from z comedy (where my Return of the Living Dead fans at), which makes Ellie’s wisecracks and teen sass all the more welcome. Her “twitch” gag and then muttering okay, if she can’t have a gun she’ll throw a sandwich is low-key but refreshing comic relief.\n- Tess’s line, “It’s the long or way or the we’re-fucking-dead way,” is one I plan to use on my next car trip.\n- Art direction kudos: One-second shot of empty restaurant: tablecloths covered in moss, water glasses brimful of green. Nearly every shot has a verdant splash, even when the trio cross the hotel roof bar, plastic chairs are bright green.\n- Is the idea of a Zombie Siesta new in z lore? When the undead aren’t actively chasing lunch or out for a nice shamble, do they take a grumbly disco nap?\n- Random thought re: the colonial history we glimpse in the spooky museum: White European settlers were an invasive species in the Americas.\n- Calling it now: Tendril smooch with Anna Torv? Most sex in all of season one.",

The Last of Us Part II debuts June 19 for the PlayStation 4, but I’ve played through the game a couple of times for this review. And I am glad to say I am not disappointed with the risks the developer took, even though the game didn’t go where I thought it would go, nor where I wanted it to go.\nEarly on, the previews gave us clues that a tragic event that would trigger the journey of the second game. There is no question that playing the game is an intense emotional and moving experience. But the story had some twists that I believe will prove controversial and perhaps unpopular among enthusiastic fans.\nI’m glad to see some risk-taking. The stakes couldn’t be higher. With more than 100 million PS4s sold, Sony has a chance to sell tens of millions of copies of this game (as of 2018, The Last of Us sold 17 million copies). The original won numerous Game of the Year awards, and it’s my favorite game of all time.\nEarly on, I detested parts of the story. But Naughty Dog committed itself to this unpopular direction. Despite my initial misgivings, I’m glad they went down this road, because it made me question my sense of right and wrong.\nEvent\nGamesBeat Summit 2023\nJoin the GamesBeat community in Los Angeles this May 22-23. You’ll hear from the brightest minds within the gaming industry to share their updates on the latest developments.\nIt’s so eerie to play the game about a post-pandemic zombie apocalypse during a pandemic, with sirens for emergency vehicles going off in the background in real life. If there was a solace, I played this one together with my middle daughter, who was too young to play such a serious game when the first one debuted.\nBut I was so much happier in the sadness of the world of The Last of Us Part II, and I was so disappointed to snap out of it after each play session and emerge in today’s reality. We have waited for this game for a long time, with multiple delays. But the good thing about those delays is that I did not encounter any showstopper bugs in the game on my PS4 Pro. That is exceedingly rare.\nNaughty Dog vice president Neil Druckmann (who directed The Last of Us Part II) and the company’s own trailers have spoiled a lot of the story. But you shouldn’t place stock in everything that they have led you to believe. Part II is not at all what it seems. In fact, Naughty Dog has gone out of its way to mislead us into thinking what the game is about.\nWhat you’ll like\nA story told in a compelling way\nI’ve already begun to sound like I want to rewrite Naughty Dog’s script. But let’s be clear. I believe that nobody tells better stories than Naughty Dog. This story is told in a series of flashbacks and flash-forwards in a timeline. You’ll see the characters get put into an excruciating situation, and then you’ll have to wait, as the story moves back in time to a flashback that will explain how you got into that situation.\nThis can be very frustrating until you learn the reason for the flashbacks, and that makes the dramatic impact so much bigger. I’d like to say so much more, but that would be spoiling the story.\nFlashbacks are an interesting tool for a storyteller because they give you a way to learn something about a character who is dead in its present but still alive in your memory.\nThe story of the first game came with a bookend ending that resonated for me. I was deeply touched by the story of the teenage girl Ellie and gruff smuggler Joel — two survivors of the zombie apocalypse who spend their days just trying to survive. The graphic violence is horrific, but more often than not, Joel does it in the name of protecting Ellie, and later on it’s Ellie protecting Joel. Fighting the zombies takes skill and stealth, and too often the human enemies are worse.\nAt the beginning of The Last of Us, Joel loses his teenage daughter at the start of the pandemic. By the end of the game, he had to decide whether to save Ellie or watch his surrogate daughter die. He had to choose how much he was willing to sacrifice for somebody he loved. Joel made the choice of a parent, and it was easier to make that choice even though the fate of the world was at hand. What made his choice easier is that, throughout the entire game, we learned what a shitty place the world had become.\nWhen I finished the first game, I thought about a quote from Steven Spielberg’s film, Schindler’s List, about the German man who saved Jews during the Holocaust. It says, “Whoever saves one life saves the world entire.” That quote came to mind as I finished the game. Joel saved a life, and he said the world be damned.\nAnd now Joel has to live with that choice in Part II. The sequel is not about love, but hate. It is about what you would sacrifice to take revenge. Can you get justice and closure without sacrificing your soul? The main characters go on a long journey to discover something about themselves. This new game also has its bookend ending, and all I will say about that, for now, is that it involves a guitar.\nAmazing graphics affect gameplay\nThis is one of the prettiest games with it comes to graphics on the PS4. So many graphical marvels appeared in the imagery that I lost count. But these improvements in graphics aren’t just part of the scenery — they affect gameplay.\nOn a skyscraper in the clouds, the fog gets in your way just as you’re trying to aim at an enemy. The grass blows in the wind, and it gives you a place to hide while you creep up on a foe. You can swim underwater, find key secrets at the bottom, and emerge in a place where the enemy doesn’t expect you.\nThe story spans seasons and climates, such as the snows of Jackson, Wyoming or the lush jungle-like landscapes of an overgrown Seattle. The cities are authentic, with great attention to detail. You’ll find coffee shops in Seattle, but they’re overrun with vines, moss, and long grass growing out of cracks in the floors and walls.\nIn Wyoming, Ellie loses track of another character, Dina, in a snowstorm and then finds her again. In that way, the environment plays a role in the gameplay as well as the story.\nA diversity of characters with different perspectives\nWe’re used to video games that give us good guys and bad guys. In the previous game, our main characters were just Ellie, then 14, and Joel, a grizzled old man in his 40s. In Part II, Ellie (played by Ashley Johnson) and Joel (Troy Baker) are four years older. But they’re joined by a big cast of characters in Jackson, Wyoming, like Jesse (Stephen Chang), Dina (Shannon Woodward), Tommy (Jeffrey Pierce), and others — as well as a number of strangers that we meet along the way.\nThis game goes out of its way to paint two sides to every person and to show them in shades of gray. Ellie and Joel are both brutal killers in the first game, and they remain so in the second game, though they have settled down in Jackson. Now their job is to protect their home from the Infected (as the zombies are called) and human foes outside the walls. Yes, even after a pandemic, more so than today, humanity has to live in a world that has walls, and those walls have to be guarded by people like Ellie and Joel.\nWhile the first game doesn’t have much by way of supporting characters, the sequel’s cast gives us a contrasting point of view to the people we have come to love. They are different kinds of survivors, and they highlight how people can make some contrasting choices in this gray world.\nSignificant gameplay improvements\nPart II has some huge technological improvements. In close combat and in exploration, Ellie can do so much more thanks to these changes. And it makes the fighting intense, grueling, and raw in a way that, if you can believe it, doesn’t happen in the first game.\nShe can swing on ropes, climb vertical structures to avoid trouble, navigate boats, ride horses, break glass, and crawl through grass. She faces enemies such as dogs who can trace her footsteps, stealth warriors who can attack with arrows, and large numbers of zombies. Ellie can sprint, dodge attacks, and time her counterattacks. She can use enemies as a shield, and she can get help from her friends. This makes combat far more diverse than in The Last of Us.\nAnd as she does in the first game, Ellie can pit enemies against each other, making zombies attack humans. All of these improvements ratchet up the level of skill.\nOccasional humor\nOne character makes a keen observation about how two others are behaving awkwardly when together. It just so happens that one of the characters, who is afraid of heights, is trying to deal with a high crossing. The character replies, “Now?” As in, you have to ask me that now? It’s pretty comic, trust me. And after a particularly difficult level, one of the characters screams, “Fuck Seattle!”",

It is a magnificent game, a fitting sequel to an already well-regarded masterpiece, and if it turns out to be the last great hurrah for an aging console – much like its predecessor – it enables the PS4 to retire gracefully.\nThat's not to say it'll be everyone's cup of tea. There are some that will hate it - absolutely despise its unrelenting brutality. And it will no doubt draw the ire of those who already decry violence in games. It is often as gory, graphic and unsettling as games can be. But what they will not understand – can never understand – is that every interaction, no matter how bloody, is steeped in context and consequence, pathos and pay-off, and that is where it differs from the vast majority of its peers.\nThis is gaming as art at its finest – a 30 hour plus movie or box set bonanza you can play. And it is utterly engrossing from the swaying boat title sequence to the last credit on the roll. The Last of Us Part 2 is everything we'd hoped and so much more besides.\nHere's why.\nOur quick take\nThe Last of Us Part 2 is quite simply essential. It answers the question of whether you can bottle magic twice. In fact, Naughty Dog found an even bigger, fancier bottle to fill this time.\nThere are minor caveats, including the enemy AI being dumb on one or two occasions and wandering haplessly into the same trap as their friends, while some skirmishes can feel samey. But, these are tiny considerations in comparison with the overall scope and depth of the game.\nYes, it is brutal and uncomfortable. And, no matter your stomach, it will unsettle you. But, you’ll also cry, smile and, if you’re anything like us, be left in a quivering heap more often than you'd like to admit. It takes you on a rollercoaster ride of emotions and will indelibly mark itself in your memory long after.\nThis is a grown-up game in every sense and a suitable and fitting monument to an entire console generation.\nThe Last of Us Part 2 - 5.0 / 5\n|FOR||AGAINST|\nThe same but different\nBefore we get into the nitty gritty, we have to warn you of spoilers. We're attempting to steer clear of any significant plot spoilers, or even insignificant ones, but if you want to play the game with little or no preconceptions, please look away now. In fact, don't read a single review at all, just get the game, load it and get lost in its glory for yourself.\nIf you're still with us though, we'll start with the new gameplay mechanics.\nThe Last of Us 2 is similar in many ways to the original. It too is a survival horror, action adventure, and stealth-em-up in a single package. It has a linear narrative, with beginning, middle and end - although not necessarily in that order. And, like LOU, it is cut into segments/chapters that you have to navigate through and complete before moving to the next.\nHowever, as a sequel, it has so much more besides – partly because it originates on more capable hardware, but also because the main protagonist is different: a more complex, less direct lead in the form of Ellie.\nShe plays similarly to Joel in the first game, and you will find you can pick up and play instantly thanks to familiar controls. But Ellie also has additional abilities that make her more manoeuvrable, better in stealth situations, and generally more proficient in the art of killing.\nAs well as Naughty Dog's tried and trusted duck and cover mechanics, she can now lie prone, to hide in long grass and foliage – even move around and shoot from that position without immediate detection. She can also jump across gaps, allowing for more verticality in levels and, especially, variety during firefights.\nEllie also has a switchblade in her inventory from the start – negating the need for her to build destructible shivs. And her crafting table differs from Joel's, with a wider selection of tools to play with (once unlocked).\nArrows can be crafted for example, even explosive ones if you happen to find the recipe. Explosive mines can also be made from available resources, ones that don't require setting as traps.\nWhile Joel could learn several new tricks through the use of “supplements”, there is now a wider selection on offer in a more full-fledged skill tree. Different arms of the tree can be unlocked through finding instruction manuals, and each arm has a selection of skills that can be unlocked in sequential order – all through munching on supplements as before.There are plenty more to discover along the way too, but we'll let you find them for yourself as that's half the fun. Needless to say, the gamut of craftable items is much larger, with more depth this time around – something that also applies to the skill tree.\nThis allows for a wider variety of character skills, to suit your own particular play style. It gives the game more of a role-player feel. You might have to experience the story in exactly the form designated by Neil Druckmann and his team at Naughty Dog, but how you get to each major plot point feels more in your hands.\nMelee is another big addition to the gameplay in Last of Us 2. We were told that original plans for the sequel would have resulted in a very different type of game, one based more on hand-to-hand combat and less on exploration or gunfights. This didn't happen but some of the DNA of the alternative game remains.\nDuring melee combat, you can duck and dodge attacks and time blows in order to take down enemies you wouldn't have dreamed of getting close to in the first game. It helps if you have a melee weapon, but you can win a hard-fought battle with just your fists by timing strikes accurately. Even the deadly Clickers can be dodged, although we then suggest running rather than provoking them any further.\nIndeed, this is a tactic you'll likely employ a lot; against infected and human enemies.\nWhat's that coming over the hill...\nThere are three main types of enemies in The Last of Us Part 2 and each have their own, individual styles. The infected are similar to before, albeit enhanced in some ways.\nThere are a couple of new types of infected, which we will again leave for you to discover as their debut sequences are among the game's best, but some of the old faves are back with new abilities too.\nStalkers, for example, now hide and are far more intelligent. Indeed, they can be petrifying as they can avoid detection in Listen Mode by staying still at times and creeping silently. Clickers too have been devilishly tweaked, with better (more savage) use of their echo-location talents.\nDuring their patrols, they occasionally stop and roar, with everything close-by suddenly being within “sight”. If you are there at the time, the chase is on, that's for sure.\nHuman foes have new bells and whistles too – literally in some cases.\nThere are two main new factions in the game. The Washington Liberation Front (WLF), also known as the Wolves, are a militaristic group similar to the Fireflies and come heavily armed. Their new abilities include the use of dogs that can sniff you out (represented by a scent trail visible in Listen Mode) and highlight your location. They can also attack you themselves and can be pretty savage.\nThe other group are the Seraphites, or Scars. These are members of a particularly nasty death cult that use bows and arrows as well as guns and communicate through whistles. It's a haunting sound, hearing whistles float across the battlefield – leaving you in no doubt that there plenty more out there.\nThe WLF and Seraphites are at war, so can sometimes be played off against each other, but both are essentially in your way and your thirst for revenge.\nWhen darkness falls\nThe main difference between Last of Us 2 and its predecessor is tone. The Last of Us was essentially a road story about a father finding a surrogate daughter through shared experiences. It was dark (very in places) but overall a story of fatherly love and hope.\nThe Last of Us 2 is about revenge, consequence and loss. We honestly cannot say much more or we'll genuinely spoil major plot points, but as a result it is much darker, angrier and more driven.\nEllie, for reasons we won't go into, has a single goal in mind and is therefore more focused. The story is too, with fewer deviations and a purposeful pace. It is split into many chapters and presents more than a few surprises along the way, but you can feel the conclusion is always on the horizon, even though it is often out of reach.\nWhat we will say is that the entire story is perfectly crafted. It twists and turns, but always keeps you on track. Yes, that means it is linear (of sorts – which you'll understand more as you play), although you never feel like you are not in control, even though you can't really affect the outcome (bar dying). It's a clever trick that Naughty Dog has pulled off many times in the past too, just not on this scale.\nThe game is huge. It's approximately twice as big as the first, if not bigger. There are more cut scenes, much larger locations - some open world - and many more of them, to boot. It also has a larger cast, with several different members accompanying you on missions at different times, and a healthy amount of collectibles and hidden locations to explore that have little to do with the plot - these are gems of discovery in themselves.\nOh, and it's all very scary. Very, very scary.\nBeauty in destruction\nEven once you've completed the game, there is plenty left to do. You get access to Naughty Dog's trademark “New Game+” plus mode once you've finished for the first time, which allows you to replay the story all over again, but this time with all the skills and weapons you ended with. And, you can replay different chapters to try to find the secrets you missed the first time around.\nWe also recommend you play it a second time at least, just to take in its majesty. Not only is this the studio's best-looking game yet, it's arguably the PlayStation 4's.\nWhile a solid 30 frames per second (rather than 60fps), the 1440p graphics on the PS4 Pro as simply stunning. The physics effects especially, with bodies falling and grass swaying, are unsurpassed. While lighting is a very important part of the game, so is handled masterfully.\nUnlike the first game, dark areas in The Last of Us 2 are extremely dark, leaving you to rely solely on the short throw of light presented by your lapel torch. It ramps up the tension no end and ensures the game takes even longer as you effectively creep everywhere when indoors – even when there are no enemies in earshot.\nThis is the case even when played on a non-HDR TV. Engage HDR too and we are talking the best example of the technology in gaming today. The contrast between the darkest and brightest points is incredible on a decent 4K HDR set. We played the game on a 55-inch Philips OLED754 TV and it was as gorgeous as it was nerve-wracking.\nYou don't really need an OLED to get the most from the game, but we do advise a decent sound system or pair of headphones. Not only is the soundtrack haunting and impactful, it is used so precisely to heighten tension that you'll be missing out on the experience if you can't hear it effectively.\nAnd, for those who have hearing, sight or movement difficulties, Naughty Dog has even included accessibility options in the settings. You can alter the controls, add visual aids, text-to-speech and audio cues, even remove motion effects to benefit those with motion sickness. It has thought of everything and everyone and, in doing so, ensures that no-one should miss out on what is possibly the best narrative-lead game on current generation consoles.\nTo recap\nHow do you top one of the best games of all time? By making it bigger, badder and more focused. The Last of Us Part 2 is unsettling at times, but that gives its story and theme more impact. This is a grown-up experience through and through and a fine example of gaming as art. PS4 owners are very lucky indeed.",

            "text": "The Last of Us Part II Review\nThere are many things about human nature we struggle against. We see what we want to see. We acquire our beliefs and perspectives from the people and the world around us. And sometimes, in order to see, we must be shown.\nThe Last of Us Part II illuminates many complicated and difficult facets of humanity – a journey that tackles empathy, anger, and how we are defined by those around us. These philosophical considerations can be uncomfortable to wrestle with, but Naughty Dog conveys them with careful nuance and unflinching emotion, creating a narrative masterpiece with a unique power few games have ever achieved.\nThe story opens with a conversation about how the first game ended – about what Joel did at the Firefly hospital, and the lie he told Ellie about it. That exchange lays the foundation for the current state of their complicated relationship, which players come to understand even more deeply as the story continues. Holed up in an encampment in Jackson, Wyoming, Ellie and Joel are trying to come to terms with the consequences of their previous actions, and the world continues to suffer from the chaos of the infection that has transformed mankind and ravaged civilization.\nThe Last of Us Part II is defined by its story at every turn, and Naughty Dog masterfully weaves its themes in at every level. It depicts the raw violence that Ellie uses to navigate this harsh world, and that violence feeds into pivotal plot points during her quest for revenge. Yes, you kill many humans and Infected along the way, but the accumulated effect of Ellie’s fury weighs on you over time. Even as you clear an area of hostile guards, you question your own role in the brutality. The people you assassinate have names, and you can overhear them talking about their loved ones as you sneak up on them. Though it’s difficult to say that this is “fun,” the way The Last of Us Part II forges this level of investment and immersion is one of its greatest strengths.\nThe chaotic, post-apocalyptic overlay creates the perfect opportunity for different factions to vie for power. In addition to the zombie-like Infected, you also fight the militarized WLF and the technology-averse Seraphites. You deal with all these groups in intense encounters that blend sneaking and shooting in varied and unpredictable ways. Ellie’s increased agility lets you jump, crawl, and vault through areas and take advantage of verticality, but the biggest improvement to combat is the way the world pushes you to play. Stealth is always rewarded, and you can control the battlefield with clever use of your resources, especially in the larger environments. I knew I made a mistake when I died, and I felt satisfaction when I skillfully handled a situation.\nEven with its many combat scenarios, The Last of Us Part II offers tranquil and lonely moments. Some areas are devoid of encounters completely, but they don’t feel barren. Instead, they focus on world-building, or cause you as a player to reflect on your actions. The people you meet along the way also play an important part in your journey; when traveling alone, you feel their absence.\nEnvironments tell their own stories of those who became infected. People waiting for their families to return, soldiers hunting deserters, and patients seeking treatment – you piece together these tragic and fascinating tales by reading notes and interpreting clues in the world. From a more practical standpoint, exploring every area is important for gathering resources used to craft items and upgrade talents like faster crawling and improved awareness. Almost every corner has something to find, and I felt rewarded for digging through drawers and searching every room. Going into an empty store, it was easy to feel for the characters in this world who had their lives upended. And as much as gaming can be an escape, the state of the real world right now provides a lens that is difficult to ignore; I never thought seeing the remains of a bookstore or a restaurant would hit harder due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but they did.\nThe production values that Naughty Dog brings to this experience are second to none. The characters don’t only look good – they look real, complete with quirks that make them more believable as humans. The world and its inhabitants are visually stunning, with artwork and animations you will see just once, quips and conversations that make the world feel alive, and a soundtrack and sound effects that brought chills to my spine. Low hums and water dripping on empty bottles add to the tension as you navigate the perils of the world.\nI can rave about the attention to detail, the world, and the combat, but the story is where The Last of Us Part II sets a new bar. It is more about challenging your heart than your reflexes, and I simply cannot recommend it enough. There is much to be said about this game that can’t be said here due to spoilers, but you should play it as soon as you can with as little info as possible. But you don’t need to know specifics to appreciate how the gameplay and environmental cues all play into a single purpose: They make you feel the choices, helplessness, and the violence at the heart of this world and its characters. I can safely say this is the best narrative game I have played. I felt the loss. I felt the confusion. It is a game that turned me inside out with each twist of the screw.",

            "text": "At this point, I think everyone has some personal hot take on The Last of Us Part II. If you've played the game or not, you know something about it and I'm certain you have feelings about it. My job is to give those feelings a numerical evaluation. It was not an easy task. The Last of Us Part II is probably the most ambitious game Naughty Dog has ever made, and there's a lot here. So let's see if Part II should be the last of us.\nYeah, we're starting with that awful pun. You're welcome.\nTaking place about four years after the events of the first game, Ellie has lived a generally peaceful life in Jacksonville, despite some minor turbulence. However, an event I can't detail without getting deep into spoiler territory throws her life into upheaval and causes her to take a long trip to Seattle with a few of her friends. Their goal? Hunt down a woman named Abby and kill her. Of course, Abby has her own life, her own friends, and you're going to be seeing things from her perspective as well. As you may suspect, things are going to go horribly wrong for everyone.\nDon't Infected Open Inside\nI know that's vague, I really do, but it's a bit hard to talk about The Last of Us Part II's story while tiptoeing around the spoilers. If you haven't had this story spoiled for you yet then I have to assume you have either been living under a rock or under a self-imposed internet blackout. I'd like to thank you for emerging from your self-made cocoon and checking out this review, but please go back and try to keep yourself spoiler-free a little longer. The story is simply phenomenal. The original already presented a masterclass in worldbuilding, so it really shouldn't be a surprise that its sequel manages to continue the trend. The world of The Last of Us is terrifying, full of little moments of hope sandwiched between terror and drama.\nA lot of this is also thanks to some top tier characters. Both Ellie and Abby are fantastic leads, with wonderful acting and an insane amount of personality. Each side character you interact with is equally great. There are some impressive scenes, such as Abby's first date with her boyfriend Owen, or Ellie trying to worm her way out of explaining to Jessie that she kissed his girlfriend a week after they broke up. It adds a ton of depth, both obvious and subtle, to each character and really made me feel for all of them. This is also a shame since, you know, The Last of Us is not a nice world and you can count on your fingers the number of characters that make it out alive.\nHowever, the best characters and worldbuilding can't solve the issue of bad pacing. Part II seems to have an overabundance of flashbacks, several of which just completely wreck the flow of the story. Worse, a good chunk of them run too long. The end result is that several times the story feels like it's about to pick up into something a little faster paced before suddenly grinding to a halt. It also doesn't help that Part II as a whole is a little longer than it should be. That doesn't mean every flashback is bad, one of them is even straight up my favorite scene in the whole series so far, but I feel like the story could have flowed a lot better and the campaign made more manageable if a few of these flashbacks popped up in different places with chunks cut out.\nEverything Goes A-Ok\nGoing into Part II, I was convinced nothing good could come from the story. One of my prevalent thoughts wasn't an unpopular one: Joel and Ellie's story was finished, and things would be better if a fresh installment focused on new characters. It turns out that I wasn't exactly right on that. Joel and Ellie had plenty of stories left and plenty of ways to grow, and I absolutely loved getting to see this continuation. Now? I want to see more of them, and wouldn't mind seeing a Part III show up down the road. Even if I'm sure all it will manage to do is break my heart more than it already is.\nThe basics behind the gameplay haven't changed too much since the original game. You'll be playing out a horror third-person shooter with a heavy emphasis on mid-combat crafting, stealth, and accurate aiming. You rarely have more than a full clip of ammo, often relying on melee attacks in dangerous situations because it may just not be a good idea to use up your last shotgun round when you may need it later. Scavenging is important, as is finding crafting materials so you can hastily assemble Molotov cocktails and pipe bombs in the middle of combat.\nWhat really sets it apart from other third-person shooters is, again, just how scarce supplies are. Missing a shot in other games is usually lame and unfortunate. Missing a shot in Part II is a devastating setback. You won't find machine guns or assault rifles and there are no ammo caches that refill everything you spent. You just have whatever you can find off of whoever had the misfortune of dying before you showed up.\nMurder is the Language of Choice\nYou'll alternate between Ellie and Abby throughout the 25-hour campaign. While both characters generally play the same, there are some seemingly minor differences between the two that actually lead to totally different play styles. For example, Ellie can craft Molotov cocktails while Abby makes pipe bombs. That may not sound like a huge difference, however, there's a lot more to it. A molotov cocktail uses the same crafting material as a medkit, which already means you're making a pretty important choice.\nOn the other hand, crafting a pipe bomb requires more materials but actually nabs you two bombs for your efforts. Molotovs hit the ground and instantly explode, creating a zone you can lure infected into, while pipe bombs take a few moments to explode, and once they blow they're done. That's just one example of a small difference that actually means quite a bit, and it's not even getting into things like different guns or upgrade trees.\nNone of that would matter if the enemies weren't worth fighting, but Part II is loaded with those. The infected are back and seem to be deadlier than ever. The most common type you'll see are runners, which are basically just fast zombies. Yet you'll also need to deal with the stealthy stalkers, the terrifyingly strong clickers, and a new type called shamblers that constantly emit poisonous gas. It's a good variety of enemies, and I had a great time trying to find creative ways to dodge and kill them. You'll probably also be using a lot of melee attacks, and the addition of a dodge button does wonders as to making the melee combat flow better.\nMuch to my surprise, the human enemies have a pretty high variety as well. You're up against two main factions here. The WLF is more of the \"heavily armed and goes in loud\" type. They have rifles, shotguns, trained dogs to sniff you out, and will throw pipe bombs as well. On the other hand, the Seraphites prefer bows, long-ranged weapons, and a stealthier approach. You can't really fight both types the same way, and in particular, it's nice to see the Seraphites because they use the same tactics you've become used to using.\nFlamethrowers Wanted\nYou'll have to quickly adapt no matter the situation. If you're against infected enemies, you'll find yourself moving around a lot to dodge their attacks and lure them into traps instead of using ammo. On the other hand, human enemies play like a slower cover-based shooter, with you having to make careful shots and being sure not to miss. Stealth can help in both situations, but you're always going to want to keep ready for if you manage to mess it up entirely.\nSometimes the stars align and you come to a glorious moment: times when there are both infected and human enemies in the same place. Using this to your advantage and pitting the two factions against each other quickly became some of my absolute favorite moments of Part II. I found myself throwing bottles and smashing windows before moving back so I could watch my labor pay off with an infected tearing some guy's throat out. AI battles are always amusing, and I could watch them fight each other for hours if given the opportunity.\nOccasionally you'll hit a special combat section, which usually means fighting while the passenger of a moving vehicle. You'll often find yourself with unlimited ammo and that it's rather difficult to die here. They're obviously scripted action set-piece events, but they're also really cool and fun to play so that's totally fine. There's also a decent sniper section where it's just nice to be able to kill infected without them posing any threat to you for once. There are a few boss fights, which usually tend to be intense moments that require you to use as much of your arsenal as possible. I'd rather not spoil those moments much further than that though.\nSurprise!\nIt's not all murder and combat, as there's also some light puzzle-solving. You won't be translating ancient ruins or assembling weird puzzles like the Uncharted series. Instead, a lot of it is just trying to figure out how to get from location A to B. You'll be doing things like finding codes hidden in written notes, pushing around dumpsters to help you climb up walls, or figuring out how to throw ropes over support beams so that you can swing across gaps. Sometimes you can even do this in special ways to access optional areas, where you can find more supplies and collectible trading cards or coins. None of it is excessive or difficult (in fact, if you get stuck in one spot for too long, a character will straight up tell you the answer), but it's a nice break from the norm.\nThere's one thing missing here, and that's multiplayer. The original game had a surprisingly well-loved multiplayer component. Part II lacks anything of the sort, although it is apparently coming at a later date as a stand-alone offering. Still, I'll admit that I wish it was here now since I wouldn't mind the chance to take the combat elements to an online setting. At least the single player is rather meaty and should keep you going for some time.\nSomehow, Naughty Dog also took the time to make what may possibly be one of the most lovely games I've ever seen. It's not just the beautiful graphics, although I don't quite believe I've seen a game as good looking as this one. It's also the little details. The way snow falls out of a tree when you run into it, or how ropes and glass react to other objects. There are so many living details to make this feel like a real world, and I just couldn't get over every interaction. Perhaps the only graphical fault I have is that there is an intense film grain effect that's pretty annoying, to the point where my roommate saw me playing the game and his first comment was \"does your TV suck or is that bad film grain?\" I wish there was an option to shut it off, especially since there are options for other effects like motion blur and camera sway.\nThe Last of Us Part II Review | Final Thoughts\nReally, I can't believe how much I actually enjoyed The Last of Us Part II. It's not the strongest PlayStation exclusive, God of War and Dreams are still my preferences there, but this is still an extremely well-made game. From a story that manages to build upon the original in all the ways, I didn't know I wanted, to gameplay that takes an already solid foundation and amps it up, to just straight up being beautiful, The Last of Us Part II has managed to make me more excited than ever to have my heart completely broken.\nTechRaptor reviewed The Last of Us Part II on PlayStation 4 using a copy purchased by the reviewer.\nReview Summary\nPros\n- Instantly Captivating Story\n- Fantastic Characters\n- Fun Combat\n- Great Enemy Variety\n- Puzzles Are a Nice Distraction\n- Stunningly Beautiful\nCons\n- Occasionally Poorly Paced and a Little Too Long\n- No Multiplayer\n- Film Grain is Annoying",

I had no knowledge of the game going in. But the story, the action, the twists and the performances are fantastic. This is a must-watch on HBO\n-\nIt's good but it's a long slog. Season felt padded.\n-\nDidn't play the game but couldn't stop watching the show. Great work.\n-\nAddictive, gritty, heartwarming and emotive series - some incredibly powerful, thought-provoking moments and some great acting from the star leads!\n-\nBella Ramsey is annoying as Ellie, sorry. Questionable casting choices and I don't understand the hype. Was hoping it would get better.\n-\nThe levels of meaning packed into this show... it's unbelievable. I never thought a show about a zombie apocalypse could ever be this deep, this moving, emotional, and relevant. I have to admit, walking dead wasn't bad, but this has huge potential. And right now, it's already killing it.\n-\nReally great and stays true to the game. Even if you've never played the game before this is a must see and this is how you do a game adaptation!\n-\nAs I have no connection to the game, I am just viewing this on its own, and I found The last of us to be a terrific first season that moves slowly to bring lots of weight to its apocalyptic story with its focus on emotional human drama to create hefts of suspense and melancholy. Each episode feels its own and is immersive, the first is by far one of the most intense opening episodes to exist, two is a thrill ride that sets the core relationship on its course, three is a heart breaking stand alone story, four is necessary build up, five is a masterclass of suspense, six was also brilliant, seven wasn't my favourite but was effective by the end, then eight was shockingly brutal and nine was a fast, intense and perfect place to conclude a first season. The way this show builds it world through different characters and societies, whilst always moving the core plot forward was paced exceptionally well and I appreciated its more sombre approach it had to its story. Yet its the two lead characters that really make the whole thing great and underneath all the melancholy, the show has heart and a surprising sense of awe that make it a deep experience that is also very thrilling. As someone who hasn't played the games, I found this to just be an excellent season that leaves me on the edge for more.\n-\nHBO delivers once again. Personally I missed the brutality, violence and gruesomeness that provides for Elies and Joels deepening of relationship, but its not necessary as I came to realize. The payoff that the first game delivers is worthy of being remade for non-gamers. Strong message with deep implications.\n-\nThis videogame transposition to a series is just insanely great! The quality of this series is just every prejudice you may have... Just watch it, you won't regret it!",

            "text": "The Last of Us Episode 2 review: Tess takes drastic action to save Ellie\nIf The Last of Us premiere was all about introducing us to Ellie and Joel, then The Last of Us Episode 2 is focused on expanding the world and showcasing just what a post-apocalyptic 2023 would look like.\nWhen I heard that The Last of Us was on the way to becoming one of the most expensive HBO shows ever, even surpassing Game of Thrones, I had my doubts. How could a zombie show be pricier than a show with massive CGI dragons? But this episode proves HBO invested every cent in ensuring The Last of Us looks as incredible as its video game counterpart.\nEven if everything else were terrible, it would still be worth watching this series to see the beautiful production design. Without people running amok, nature runs its course. Ivy, moss, decay and fungus have overtaken cars and buildings, laying claim to the wreckage. Using a mixture of broad sweeping camerawork and crane shots, The Last of Us Episode 2, “Infected,” takes time to show off the details of this gorgeous and terrifying new world.\nSPOILERS ahead for The Last of Us Episode 2\nSimilar to the premiere episode, the second installment opens in the past, setting up background information about the fungal outbreak. In Indonesia in 2003, a scientist (Christine Hakim) is called in to investigate a strange case of cordyceps infecting a human.\nOnce she sees the aftermath of the infection, she tells the soldiers that the only choice moving forward is to bomb the cities where the infected were found; 14 at the time. There’s no other possible cure. I loved this opening scene. It was ominous and tense, effectively establishing the stakes and setting the stage for what follows.\nMost of “Infected” is spent following Ellie, Joel, and Tess as they trek through the biohazard zone toward the meet-up point with the Fireflies. We see what the city looks like outside of the quarantine zone for the first time, and it exceeds expectations. There’s also a reference to the cold open, as Ellie comments on a crater left behind by one of the bombs. Clearly the military took the scientist’s advice, but it wasn’t enough to save humanity.\nAs the trio navigates through streets, fallen buildings, and an old museum, we get more recreations of great moments from the video game. “Infected” features the introduction of the Clickers, one of the most horrifying breeds of zombies in this world. Clickers differ from other Infected in that they cannot see but instead track their prey by sound.\nSneaking past a horde of Clickers in the game is a unique kind of terror. As the creative director and writer of the games, Neil Druckmann was the perfect person to direct this episode.\nAs video game fans know, the resulting skirmish with the Clickers leads to Tess’ death. She gets bitten during the fight. Ellie does too, but the drastic difference between their wounds is enough to convince Tess and Joel that Ellie really is immune. Unfortunately, all the Fireflies are already dead by the time they arrive at the meet-up.\nBefore digging into the climactic ending of The Last of Us Episode 2, I want to use a little aside to explain why I love the show-specific cordyceps tendrils. Many people online are debating whether the series made a mistake by changing the primary method of infection from spores to tendrils, but I think it was a great decision.\nThe Last of Us subs in tendrils for spores, and it’s a great choice\nThe sequence of all the Infected writhing together on the ground, connected by an underground system of fungal tendrils, was so disturbing. It was like a Junji Ito manga coming to life in live-action. It might be controversial, but the tendrils are more frightening than the spores. And the logic of not wanting to hide Pedro Pascal’s beautiful face behind yet another mask also holds up. And the tendrils result in the most spine-tingling scene on the show so far.\nAfter arriving at the meeting location full of dead Fireflies and realizing they won’t be making the trade for Ellie, Tess makes a drastic decision to ensure Ellie can get where she needs to go and potentially save the last of humanity. While the trio investigate the deaths, they disturb a clump of fungus, meaning every member of the Infected connected to that specific network of tendrils wakes up and comes charging toward the building.\nKnowing she’s going to die anyway, Tess pleads with Joel to take Ellie and run as she pours gasoline and dumps grenades all over the place, intending to blow up the whole building along with any Infected inside so they can escape. Her plan works, albeit just barely, as Tess lights her lighter at the last possible second—after an Infected has kissed her and let its nasty fungal tendrils creep down her throat. Yeah, that made my skin crawl.\nTess’ end is slightly different from the game. There she’s killed by soldiers, but I think this ending is more cinematic. I also think it’s good that The Last of Us is making some changes from the source material. As cool as the scene-by-scene recreations are, adaptations are meant to experiment a little. That’s the whole point of adapting a story to a different medium, after all.\nThe Last of Us Episode 2 ends with Joel and Ellie on their own as their journey truly begins.\nEpisode Grade: A\nTo stay up to date on everything fantasy, science fiction, and WiC, follow our all-encompassing Facebook page and sign up for our exclusive newsletter.\nGet HBO, Starz, Showtime and MORE for FREE with a no-risk, 7-day free trial of Amazon Channels",

            "text": "By now, you, I, and every other person with a PlayStation 4 has heard of The Last of Us Part 2. At the time of writing, it has broken records to become Sony’s fastest-selling title on the PS4, beating Spider-Man. I started playing Last of Us Part 2 at the same time as everyone else, having purchased my copy, so I took my time to enjoy the scenery and scout out hidden items in the game at my leisure. After dozens of hours in The Last of Us Part 2, and at least half a dozen full playthroughs of The Last of Us, I am finally ready to weigh in on what has become a fairly controversial game.\nBefore we get into the mechanics he Last of Us Part 2 and pick apart the artistry within, I want to take a moment to really appreciate the accessibility options available here. Beyond simple captions and contrast settings, Naughty Dog built an entire setup system that launches before the game begins. There are presets for hard of hearing, low vision, colorblind, and physical handicaps. The colorblind options cover several different types of colorblindness, and a separate function changes backgrounds to greyscale to further increase contrast. For those with hearing loss or deafness, captions can be turned on, color-coded for different characters, and a screen display of which direction footsteps and other sounds are coming from added. Captions are available in multiple sizes. Those with physical handicaps can change tapping prompts to holding the button instead, as well as add the option to change some key bindings and one to skip puzzles via the pause menu. The difficulty settings cover every player, from ultra-casual storyline visitors to hardcore players who want to try to make it out with one bandage and a shiv. This is the new bar for accessibility in AAA games. Difficulty settings themselves aren’t really accessibility; if a player cannot see the game on easy mode, they still can’t play. If there is no visible marker for sounds, deaf players can’t play, either. Those of us with progressive arthritis really appreciate not having to tap a button twenty times and take extra painkillers just to reach the end of a game. Games are for everyone, and The Last of Us Part 2 is the ultimate embodiment of that thus far.\nRight off the bat, returning players will feel right at home with The Last of Us Part 2‘s controls. Combat, crafting, and navigation work pretty much the same as The Last of Us, making the transition between games easy. Ellie is all grown up now, and the expected tensions between a young adult and parent are present between her and Joel. They’re still in Jackson, and the town is doing well. There is even a daycare and school, along with restaurants and saloons. What could make the apocalypse better than adding alcohol to already tense situations? If the answer is “a joint,” they’ve got that, too. It turns out the zombie apocalypse is just Colorado.\nPlayers are very quickly introduced to the other playable character in this entry, Abby. Abby is a six-foot-tall woman built like an underfed linebacker and with the approximate attitude of a kicked TSA agent. Like absolutely everyone else, she’s had a hard life, and like Ellie, she’s pretty damn sure she’s had it harder than anyone else. Nothing says fun like forty hours of playing characters with zero introspection or self-awareness. The game itself does get to be fun in the middle, but the early and final hours are an absolute masterclass in how not to write a story.\nThis brings us to a huge elephant in the room. Without spoilers, Naughty Dog chose to take several shortcuts in storytelling that alienate returning players within 90 minutes of starting the game. Returning players in a series tend to make up a large portion of pre-release purchases, which means that many players who threw up their arms on the game over lazy storytelling and poor character development were able to leave a review based on those feelings within 90 minutes of release. I’ve seen many articles blaming the review-bombing of The Last of Us Part 2 entirely on homophobia, but here is the thing: the vast majority of those reviews do not mention LBGT issues at all. Most of them do bring up the early story development and the fact that many players refuse to continue past that point. A fair amount are homophobic, yes, but this was not a One Million Moms campaign to tear down a game. Some people are always going to be homophobic little shits, but it isn’t exactly good ally behavior to dismiss every single bad review as “they just hate the gays” when many of those reviews never mention LGBT issues at all, make valid points about the storyline, and are even backed or written by LGBT players. As a queer woman myself, I threw down my controller and went out to the garden for an hour after hitting a specific early story point, not because it should never have happened, but because the leadup was sloppy and disrespectful to players. The fact that the development team chose to do that at such an early point that they could receive an avalanche of negative reviews in the first couple of hours post-release is maybe something the story team should sit in the corner and ponder for a bit.\nThe good news is that out of forty or so hours of play, the first two and final two are the only ones that suffer in storytelling hell. The rest of the game is genuinely enjoyable. Enemies from the first game feature heavily in the first half of The Last of Us Part 2, and new, stronger enemies are gradually added into the mix. Boss fights are well-paced, though they are much more fun in the latter half of the game. The world feels more open in this entry, too, leading to more exploration that gives much better depth to the lore. For players who search hidden rooms and leave the direct path, there is a plethora of upgrades, items, and background information to be had. I highly suggest keeping an eye out for slightly open windows and cracks along the bottoms of walls.\nWhile I have serious qualms with the handling of certain sections of the main storyline, the side stories and world are fantastic. Areas that could have more items or weapon workshops are marked on the map as they are discovered, and are optional for players to explore. Some items and notes will prompt characters to make a note on the map of where supply stashes could be hidden, and keys and codes are often found relatively far away from their corresponding locks. I felt compelled to read every note I came across and pick up any interactable object, and I even found myself sneaking around listening to NPC conversations to find out more about the world. It’s a tough balancing act for single-player games to create depth and realism in the world around their characters without bogging down the main storyline, and The Last of Us 2 handles this exceptionally well.\nThe main story does have pacing issues in the beginning, but it settles into a great rhythm after a couple of hours. Flashbacks keep the pace going and explain Ellie and Abby’s character development. However, it would have been great if that could have been done in chronological order instead of whipping players into different times and settings without notice. The flashbacks themselves, though, serve to make the game much more enjoyable. The vast majority of playtime is spent in Seattle, Washington, because we do not have enough zombie games set in the Pacific Northwest. It rains constantly, it floods often, and even the unnamed background characters commonly state how much they hate the city. Brief visits to drier climates and better relationships make for a nice break from the endless monotony of green and wet.\nNew factions appear at a good pace, too. Abby’s group is introduced at a reasonable pace after the first hours of the game, and their history is built upon to make a believable storyline. Players get to know characters and build relationships during their time with Abby, rounding out her personality nicely. Their enemies, the Seraphites, also appear organically and get plenty of introduction. The final group at the end, though, gets zero introduction, no explanation, and no depth of story. I have to assume the writers were sick of it by that point because their addition is so slap-dash it could have been dreamed up by the Three Stooges. Why are they here? What do they want? Where did they come from? Who fucking cares, it’s the last hour of the game. No need for consistency here. Not only do the entire two or three ending hours of the game suffer from pacing issues, but they also don’t feel like they even fit with the rest of the game They feel more inspired by Until Dawn. While that is an enjoyable game, its style doesn’t quite mesh with the fast pace of The Last of Us Part 2, which creates a jarring disconnect in storytelling.\nNeil Druckmann has apparently said there will be no DLC for The Last of Us Part 2, and he doesn’t see another sequel fitting in with the series, and frankly, I’d buy every person in Jackson a round to drink to that. The game is stunningly beautiful. The sound design is great, and there are very few games that can compare for entertainment value and exploration for the vast majority of the time spent playing. At the end of the day, though, Naughty Dog can’t get out of its own way. I spent years waiting for a sequel to The Last of Us, and now I know that was a Monkey’s Paw request. I don’t want another sequel to this series ever again, because someone else did the sequel, and they did it better.\nAs I played The Last of Us Part 2, I noticed themes and explanations pulled directly from a different title that was obviously inspired by The Last of Us. Just over a year ago, I reviewed Days Gone. I spent dozens of hours in that game before writing my review and replayed it immediately after. I’ve revisited it several times since then. As I played through The Last of Us Part 2, I was struck by how many times the game seemed to reference things that were part of the lore of Days Gone, not The Last of Us. Migrating hordes of infected? That is lifted directly from Days Gone. Several crowd control techniques were also pulled, like being pitted in a small area against both human and infected enemies, where the obvious – and likely only – answer is to use them against each other and escape. Crafting pipe bombs on the fly? I half expected to see Deacon St. John running the WLF.\nI like this game. I will probably replay it once to finish out my trading card collection since I am only short a couple of cards. Really, though, it pushes more towards playing The Last of Us and Days Gone again. If anything, it served to pull those two titles close enough together that Naughty Dog can move on to new stories and characters and let Bend Studio pick up the flag and run with it. How many zombie games about damaged people learning to live in a broken world set in the Pacific Northwest do we really need, anyway?\nThe Last of Us Part 2 is worth the money, but I feel like it would have worked much better as Part 3, with the story between this entry and where we left off with Joel and Ellie before given more time. Nothing in the story felt wrong for the characters or the world they occupy, but rushing it felt wrong. There was a lot left unsaid, and I wish they had given all of these characters the space to say it.\nAs it stands, I highly recommend The Last of Us Part 2, with the caveat that I don’t want another one. It absolutely served the purpose of moving fans on from Ellie and her story, and unexpectedly made room for another series to take in the fans who were left out in the storm.\n(8 / 10)\nGreat\nRely on Horror Review Score Guide\nA retail copy was purchased for review.",

            "text": "*Spoilers for The Last Of Us Part 2*\nNaughty Dog described The Last Of Us Part 2 as its most ambitious title yet, and that came with a price. Although the video game received acclaim for critics and quickly became the UK’s fastest-selling PS4 game, the 2020 title was review-bombed on Metacritic and hit with a barrage of negative reviews, many of which came from users who hadn’t even bothered to play the game. The title currently sits at a “mixed or average” score of 5.0, but I believe it’ll go down in history as a classic.\nThe Last Of Us Part 2 is a grizzly sequel to Naughty Dog’s 2013 hit The Last Of Us, taking place five years later after the events of Part 1 and continuing the story of Joel and Ellie. In the sequel, the pair are living amongst a thriving community in Jackson but the peace is short-lived when Joel is tortured and murdered by Abby, the daughter of the surgeon you shot dead at the end of the original game to save Ellie. The shocking act of violence sends Ellie and those she loves on a quest for revenge, and a downward spiral filled with hate and anger. It’s Part 2‘s thought-provoking and emotionally exhaustive story, as well as its layered characters that will cement it as one of the greats in the years to come.\nAbby and Ellie: Two Sides of the Same Coin\nThe game’s story is split into two main sections; three days as Ellie on her quest for revenge and three days as Abby in the lead-up to her confrontation with Ellie. The game features flashbacks throughout and comes to a conclusion in Santa Barbara which Abby visits in search of the Fireflies and Ellie follows in a final and obsessive attempt at revenge. Although many users expressed anger at Naughty Dog’s decision to have you play as Abby before and after Joel’s death, it’s important to understand that it’s essential to play as Abby as the two characters are reflections of one another and their stories.\nEllie’s portion of the game sets her off in a race to find Abby and destroy her. Over her three days in Seatle, Ellie kills and tortures, grows increasingly angry and reckless, and loses a part of her humanity. In contrast, Abby starts as a person already missing their humanity and over the course of three days sets out on a path of redemption by helping, caring for, and adopting Lev, an outcast Seraphite. Abby essentially went on the same journey Joel did in the first game.\nThere are dozens of similarities between Ellie and Abby and their stories. Both were left orphaned after the death of their parents, both set out on revenge quests, both lost father figures, both were entangled in a difficult love triangle, and both wanted to be good people. At two notable points of the game, both women let the other go. Abby is called on by Lev to stop a murder and Ellie is called on by a memory of Joel. Both characters are forced to move on from their past trauma and regain their humanity.\nPart 2 is one of the few games to force you into recognising the violence you inflict upon people, both innocent and not. It questions your motivations, your love for well-established characters, and pulls a 180 on you by forcing you to play as what was initially perceived as a villain. But one lesson to be learnt from The Last Of Us Part 2 and in real life, is that not everything is black and white. The game’s characters, and essentially people in real life, are shades of grey and simply fighting for their survival.\nThe Last Of Us Part 2: Exhausting, Exhilirating, and Pure Brilliance\nThe game proves to be emotionally exhausting as players are continuously forced to question their actions and motivations. Players are forced to fight the characters they control love, and by the end of the game, shouldn’t want either to die. Although the game’s main beats are grim, the title is filled with lighthearted character interactions and exhilarating gameplay.\nNaughty Dog manages to successfully combine the layered and emotional story with some of the smoothest and exciting gameplay around, all topped off with intricate world-building, amazing sound design, detailed environments, and gorgeous graphics. All of this comes together to form a tightly made video game that pushes players to the edge through gameplay and storytelling.\nThe game is hard to get through but worth the brutal journey. It’s a great sequel to the first video game, relevant, and helps raise questions everyone should ask throughout their life. All of this is why The Last Of Us Part 2 and its characters will be remembered for years to come.\nHow long is The Last Of Us Part 2?\nThe Last Of Us Part 2 is around 25 to 30 hours long for the single-player story. However, acquiring the platinum trophy can take up to 50 or 60 hours.\nIs The Last Of Us Part 2 scary?\nThere are some very tense and moments that lean into horror, particularly in the game’s second half. These feel very much inspired by the Resident Evil franchise and may be very frightening for some players.\nDo I have to kill animals in The Last Of Us Part 2?\nYes. Throughout the game, enemies will patrol areas with dogs which track you. Although they can be avoidable, we found in our playthrough that the dogs were always alerting us to other enemies and we struggled to get away. The game also forces to you to kill a dog later on in the game. No other wildlife can be attacked or is killed.",

            "text": "From the very start of The Last of Us: Part II, Naughty Dog snatches your full attention, drawing you in like a moth to an open flame.\nThe opening credits play out like something from a Tarantino flick; setting the scene, building a sense of tension, dread and apprehension slowly and deliberately.\nSombre acoustic guitar riffs are plucked without any discernible rhythm – giving you that weird feeling that something isn’t right as you’re reintroduced to a decimated urban sprawl of Americana.\nWe meet our main characters again a few years after we left them in the first game, and Ellie continues to tend to her emotional bruises as Joel tries to make amends. You can argue it’s a slow start, but Naughty Dog is outlining everything that’s on the line here, everything its cast – and you – have got to lose.\nFrom the off, the cinematography seizes your attention. Game director Neil Druckmann has an eye as good as any of the most notable directors in cinema, and being reintroduced to returning protagonists Joel and Ellie is done delicately, emotionally, tentatively.\nSometimes, in its lingering shots of nature and staccato conversation, the game feels like a Terrance Malik film. Sometimes, in how it frames its heroes – and villains – in the world, it feels like a Steven Soderbergh.\nThere’s no denying the influence of TV and film, even in these early hours.\nThe problem with comparing games to films is that they don’t stack up. A film can’t spend two hours teaching you how it’s going to pan the camera, linger on the props, stitch action into exposition.\nCinematic games love to savour their tutorials, pretend that your offing of fifteen zombies means more than it does.\nYes, the opening hours of the game are slow. Tense, but slow. Forcing you to observe the spoon-fed humanity of its cast – complete with all the tropes of failed relationships, incongruent parent/sibling bonds and unrequited love – the front-end of this cinematic masterpiece can feel bloated.\nBurdening you with mechanics upon mechanics is enough to blunt your enthusiasm for this beautiful slice of Americana…. Until the game’s earliest – and maybe most gripping – payoff.\nA few hours in, and it all makes sense. It all clicks. The simplicity of the revenge story organises itself in your head, and you – Ellie – hit the road with your girlfriend, Dina.\nAs you make your way from Jackson, Wyoming to the city of Seattle, your PlayStation 4 will start wheezing with effort as it works to unpack what may be one of the most beautiful games on the system.\nBroken cities being overtaken by nature form the backdrop for intense and inventive set-pieces leveraging water, flora and concrete.\nEverything comes together in a naturalistic way – though you know you’re playing through levels with waist-high cover and conveniently spaced out zones, Naughty Dog’s designers have gone above and beyond in the way they bring their world to life.\nYou’re not just playing through levels, you’re playing through a city. You can lose yourself in it; believe in it. You don’t get to experience that level of thorough immersion in a lot of games.\nThe developer loves dropping ‘dog leg’ design into its crumbling buildings whose sole purpose is to hide an infected monster and scare the bejesus out of you. The tension – whether it’s in combat, in narrative, or in your own head – is erratic. Irregular. Impossible to predict.\nAnd the result is that you’re carried through the game on the back of either adrenaline, fear or instinct – or in some cases all three at the same time.\nAt its most simple, The Last of Us, Part II is a stealth game and a survival game. You’ve got very limited resources, you’ve got practically no ammo, and you’re almost always going to be on the brink of death.\nSimilarly to the first game, improvisation and crafting on the fly become integral to understanding how to survive.\nExplore, scavenge, and shank a zombie if it gets too close.\nYour ‘drone’ or ‘horde’ zombies aren’t too tricky, just don’t let them see you; sneak up behind them and stick your knife in their head. Or use some rags and a bottle to make a silencer, if you’re feeling fancy.\nBut it’s when you hear the dolphin-like barks of the Clickers… that’s when your heart jumps into your throat. Hardy, aggressive and fast, these fungus-headed infected are the unofficial icons of the game for good reason.\nThe Clickers define the gameplay when it comes to the infected, with Naughty Dog leveraging sound, sightlines, inventive prop placement and intelligent AI to pile the pressure on Ellie. Pile the pressure on you.\nLater on, you’re going to start to encounter humans and – in some cases – their dogs.\nBeing tracked and forced to move in and out of cover whilst avoiding alerting their handlers resulted in some of the hardest encounters the game had to offer. But it never felt unfair, or sadistic.\nThere was always just enough crafting material to provide an out, always just enough bullets to let you commando your way out of a firefight if things were in dire straits.\nPaired with some of the most true-to-life animation you’ll see in gaming this generation and lighting effects realistic enough to blow your mind, it feels like every encounter matters. That Ellie’s single-minded mission cannot fail, no matter how bleak it’s all getting. No matter how much blood is on her hands.\nThe most horrific things that happen in this game aren’t because of the living dead, the feral, berserker zombies. No, it’s all mankind.\nThe game’s most harrowing, you’ll-go-to-bed-thinking-about-it moments don’t come from the jump scares in dark rooms – from the shambling, clicking undead.\nWhat you see people do – willingly, wantonly, and single-mindedly – is the stuff that sticks to the inside of your head like soot.\nAside from Naughty Dog’s psychological horror fakeouts that toy with your anticipation and kick your heart into overdrive about three times an hour, there’s also the complete unpredictability of the plot.\nThe developer wants you to know this is a game about empathy, about breaking down tribalism and exploring human understanding at a macro level. And some of the choices it makes as a developer succeed – brutally – in driving that message home like a stake through the heart.\nAnd perhaps the most impressive thing throughout it all is that it treats its characters like humans. There are queer narratives, religious narratives, parental narratives, coming-of-age narratives and even comments on gender expression and identity in this game… but not once do these issues feel forced, crowbarred in for effect or agenda.\nInstead, Naughty Dog manages to make you connect with all of its cast on an emotional level, and see them for the humans they are beneath the survivalism and the bravado.\nIf you play this game and come away from it harbouring a grudge against the developer for using a female character to communicate agency, for focusing on the young, raw love of its central female couple, then you’ve failed to understand the game at its most basic level.\nNaughty Dog, in placing a 19-year-old woman as one of the angriest characters you’ll ever meet in a game in the centre of this ultra-violent, revenge-fuelled story, breaks down a lot of gaming tropes and rebuilds them in a critical, affecting way.\nNot to spoil anything here, but the ending of the game runs off the back of one of the most devastating and cathartic set-pieces you’ll have the pleasure of playing. It’ll leave you staring at the start screen – which takes on a whole new weight after the ending – slack-jawed and spent.\nThis game works hard to get in your head, and once it’s in there it wants to stay lodged in like a spore.\nThe Last of Us, Part II – Verdict 5/5\nThe Last of Us, Part II outshines the original in practically every way. The game takes level design, combat, stealth, AI and interactive narrative and uses each element to elevate the other.\nUnpredictable, intelligent and self-aware, this game seems to pride itself on digging into your head and staying there – allowing its themes and messages to grow and mutate long after the credits roll.\nNaughty Dog knows just when to take your tools off you, remove the safety blanket and provoke you. It weaves inconsistent pacing and tension together masterfully to leave you as scared and vulnerable as its protagonists.\nThis is a game that’s going to be talked about for a long time to come, and with good reason. A masterpiece.",

            "text": "A story of revenge and hate\nThe Last of Us Part 2 is a fantastic game no matter what anyone says. Seven years have passed since the release of The Last of Us for the Playstation 3, and in those seven years, the entire world fell in love with Joel and Ellie when they were first introduced to the world.\nWithout a doubt, Naughty Dog has created another masterpiece, albeit a controversial one. The Last of Us Part 2 brings new technological achievements to the table, pushing the bar for video games.\nThe sequel to the last of Us has been one of the most anticipated games in history. Part 2 has been received with mixed reviews and divided a once unified fanbase for numerous reasons. I wish to leave you with a definitive and completely unbiased opinion.\nConcept\nYears after the first game, Joel and Ellie, now live in Jackson. They begin to adjust to everyday life. Their past comes looking for them, and the game takes a first dark turn with the death of Joel in a brutal way.\nThis sets the tone for Ellie’s revenge story. Ellies’ campaign will have you traveling throughout the city of Seattle. The campaign is long and can take around 30 hours to complete. The Last of Us Part 2 is a robust emotional portrayal of hate.\nHalfway through the game, players take control of Abby, Joels killer. You learn that the doctor Joel killed at the end of the first game is Abby’s father. You learn about her life and journey to avenge her father’s death. The Last of Us shows you both sides of the coin, letting us know that no one is a hero or villain. Everyone is fighting their own battles.\nDesign\nThe Last of Us Part 2 retains the great gameplay formula but improves upon it. Objectives are straightforward, with players exploring areas of Seattle in search of supplies. You’ll go inside buildings and houses to upgrade your skill tree and weapons.\nThere’s a lot of new features like explosive arrows or putting bottles on pistols as silencers. Ellie can go prone and hide in tall grass. Another interesting mechanic is how players can squeeze through tight corridors. These spaces help when creating an escape or attack strategy.\nOne of the best highlights of The Last of Us Part 2 is its accessibility. TLOU is by far the most impressive and accessible game I’ve ever played. You can customize the button layout on your controller.\nPlayers with a disability or hearing impairment can change to the colorblind mode and adjust other settings to enjoy the story. Many people have celebrated this, and I praise the game for making it accessible. Accessibility is an essential law for designers because that is being empathetic towards our users.\nAesthetics\nThe world of TLOU has the best animation in any video game I’ve seen. Level designs are unique and never repetitive. The facial expressions and amount of animations for movement are impressive.\nEnemy deaths are brutally beautiful. There are so many different enemy death animations. Heads and limbs get blown apart from sharp weapons and explosives—dark red blood splatters across like a Jackson Pollock painting.\nEnemies shout out their comrade’s names as you take their life, adding a layer of realism to combat. There is a wide variety of melee weapons to choose from. Enemies will carry machetes, bats, sickles, hammers, and more, which makes for some incredible fatalities.\nElements like water look remarkable, with characters looking drenched and moist when leaving wet areas. At times the game has brightly colored green forests and then switches to nights with the foggy atmosphere.\nVerdict\nThe story is what will keep you busy for the first playthrough. Once the game is complete, you can restart the game on +New Game Plus and keep all your upgrades. A lot of the “Aha!” moments are better understood on the second playthrough.\nYou’ll spend your time find collectibles, which in every game unlocks 3D characters models and concept artwork. That’s all that comes with this package because there is no multiplayer. It’s not enough to only have a single-player campaign mode nowadays. I’ve moved on from the game after its release.\n‘Fractions’ is the name of the multiplayer mode that came with The Last of Us on the PS3. The mode was unique and maintained the gameplay in the main story. It’s disappointing Naughty Dog only focused on the single-player campaign.\nWhy the community is divided\nThere are two crucial factors why people will hate on The Last of Us Part 2. First of all, the story is excellent, but it would’ve been much better had Naughty Dog taken a different approach.\nPeople hate Abby killing Joel because they are emotionally attached to him. No one ever wanted Joel to die, but the players and fans don’t get to decide how a writer tells his story. Many players wrote death threats and hate speeches to Naughty Dog and Neil Druckmann.\nA lot of horrible things have been said about the story and its characters. The game has a strong emphasis on women empowerment and the LGBTQ community. Neil Druckmann himself has come to expressing female representation in a speech and podcast.\nLesbians, bisexuals, transgender people, sex scenes, two pregnancies, homophobia, and same-sex marriages with children are present. Click here to read an in-depth detailed review of the controversial topics portrayed in The Last of Us Part 2.\nValue\nWhether you feel offended or inspired by the direction of the story, every other element in The Last of Us Part 2 is incredible.\nTLOU has outstanding gameplay, animation, lighting, graphics, sound, and atmosphere. The combat and stealth are superb, with WOW moments and accessible features taking the industry in the right direction.

            "text": "The Last of Us Part II review: Exceptional gameplay but Ellie's story deserves more\nA lot of the story being told doesn't hit in the emotional way it was meant to, ultimately falling flat.\nhe Last of Us Part II has been tasked with the seemingly impossible: to be better than the first game. But does it crack under the weight of that expectation?\nIn terms of the overall story presentation, it doesn’t hold a candle to the emotional gravitas of the first, but in terms of gameplay, it is superior in every single way.\nYou can like a story being told to you in a game, but also hate the way it is told. Through this lens, The Last of Us Part II tells a perfectly fine story but tells it in all the wrong ways.\nThe Last of Us Part II picks up almost immediately after the events of the first one. Ellie and Joel are living in a community and have found some semblance of a normal life.\nSomething happens, though, and Ellie sets out on an unrelentingly brutal journey. All we can do is sit back and watch the consequences of her violence unfold. The stage is set for some textbook, powerful Naughty Dog storytelling. But, unfortunately, it just missed the shot.\nThe game is a beautiful marriage of cinematic direction and peerless gameplay. Characters and the world all feel real and the game portrays this gorgeously, telling you tragically human stories through the environment as you progress.\nIn this sense, it has expanded exceptionally upon the systems in the first game. Small signs of fragile and frantic lives once held in safety have been ripped away, and the breathtaking environmental details do not shy away from telling you this.\nBloody floors and lonely, shattered corpses all hint towards gruesomely harrowing events, cultivating an oppressively drab, desolate world. But there is unbridled beauty, too, as nature has reclaimed what was once hers.\nGameplay, combat and level design\nIn lieu of a compelling and emotional story akin to the first title, the combat, world and level design are more than enough to keep you enthralled.\nNavigating the environment is awe-inspiring and the meticulously-created locales draw you in, immersing you in this drab apocalyptic world more than you’re comfortable with.\nThe overall design, sounds and details put into every single area of the game is a marvel in itself. Nothing is there by accident, with everything placed perfectly to tell a larger story of the areas you travel through.\nNo section is the same, despite the formulaic way you travel to and from, and that in itself is more than enough reason to play, just to experience how extremely satisfying the gameplay cycle is, and how brutal combat is.\nWe want to heap praise on the balance between exploration and combat, while it sometimes becomes predictable, it is always extremely fun.\nEncounters with enemies are always brutally raw, animalistic and heart-pounding, especially when your best-laid plans of stealth go out of the window and you start blasting through all your scarce ammo.\nJust the simple act of giving every enemy a name is easily the best thing about this game. It does wonders to hint at the wider consequence of your actions.\nYou are killing people, no matter who they are, who they love, or what they’ve done, they are in your way and they must die.\nThe weight of this is felt throughout every encounter, conveyed expertly in-game. Killing someone will be met with another screaming their name out, frantically swearing revenge on you right there and then.\nFrom smashing people’s faces in with a brick to slitting their throats, Ellie’s hits are weighty and completely devoid of mercy. Random enemies will cry out in horror as you shoot a limb off and lie screaming on the floor for an uncomfortably long time.\nPeople will curse you for blowing up their dogs, too. Combat, as it should be, is harrowing and makes you feel like an absolutely monstrous person.\nThe game does a great job at blurring the lines of morals because you know that Ellie's brutality is entirely unjustified, but you root for her anyway. You also get to see things from different sides, helping to craft what could have been a much better story overall. There is no 'good team' in The Last of Us.\nBut, alas, the narrative feels like it has missed the mark entirely, with moments intended to be emotionally charged landing completely flat.\nStory presentation and direction\nTragically, most of the key story parts, which have nothing to do with Ellie, Joel or any of the Jackson cast, fail to elicit any semblance of emotional response bar a few moments.\nThey never land those all-important emotional gut-punch story beats. Instead, you feel nothing but frustration at what could have been.\nEverything has been gradually building to a hugely intense moment and the game has really hit its stride.\nBut then something happens, and instead of riding that enthrallingly glorious pacing that it has kept so well up to now, the story is brought to a grinding, nigh-on depressingly deflating halt.\nIt’s surely a left-field move that some people will love, but for us, it didn’t pay off and tarnished so much about what was good in the game. Unfortunately, we can’t reveal what happens.\nWhile this is necessary for context and motivation, too much of what is being told outside of scripted cutscenes are, at best, padding the game out and at worst unbelievably pointless. If Naughty Dog cut this lengthy content down considerably, the game would have been all the better for it in almost every way.\nThe emotional weight from the first game is seldom seen here, bar a few select scenes, and so much of it fails to elicit the emotional response you’re clearly supposed to be feeling. We like what they did, but we wish they did it better.\nThere are parts, of course, which will make your heart race during especially intense cutscenes as you're forced to just sit and watch horrific scenes unfolding.\nNaughty Dog deserves no end of praise for its portrayal of strong, bad-ass women and lesbian characters in this game, as well as the boundless number of accessibility options to make the game available to deaf, blind and disabled people.\nOverall, The Last of Us Part II is an exceptionally well-made and enjoyable game, easily a journey worth taking.\nWe stand by saying it certainly is one of the best-designed games ever made, but due to the stifled story and the issues it caused with pacing, it ultimately fails to live up to the majesty of the first game’s narrative.\nLong after the credits roll you'll no doubt think of it often... but you'll also feel that Ellie hasn’t been done the justice her character deserves.\nNote: Reviewed on my launch-day PS4.

            "text": "The HBO adaptation dives into the origins of the outbreak and tweaks one character's fate.\nThe Last of Us episode 2 landed on HBO Max last Sunday, and it saw Ellie, Tess and Joel take the first steps of their dark journey across the US. Fans of the classic video game will undoubtedly be pleased at how closely the series mirrors the source material.\nThere were a few major deviations from the game, though, so let's dive into those.\nSince the game limits its focus to Joel and Ellie's perspectives, references to the pandemic's origins are limited to notes and old newspapers scattered around the environment.\nIn contrast, episode 2's opening flashback reveals how the Cordyceps fungus brought the world to ruin in 2003. After being bitten by an unknown person, a woman working at a flour and grain factory in Jakarta, Indonesia, chomped on her coworkers before being gunned down.\nSeveral of these people were executed to stop the problem from growing, but it was too late. After being consulted by security forces and discovering that the dead woman's body had been colonized by the fungus, mycology expert Ibu Ratna (Christine Hakim) offers some terrifying advice: Bomb the city to stop it from spreading further.\nApparently accepting that this was the end, Ratna asks to be taken home so she can spend whatever time she has left with her family. Series writer Craig Mazin told CNET this is scariest moment in the show for him.\n\"That's terrifying to me,\" he said. \"It grounds everything, and the more we can make the peripheral feel real, the more the center will feel real.\"\nSo, yeah, cheery stuff. In his deep-dive into the science behind the show's fungal pandemic, CNET's Jackson Ryan noted that we're hugely dependent on rice, wheat and maize as food sources. If any of these were infected with a fungal pathogen, it could be devastating.\nIn the game, Cordyceps spreads via spores -- Mazin told ComicBook.com the team changed it for the show to avoid having characters wearing gas masks all the time (they often don them indoors in the games). Separately, \"Ibu\" isn't the scientist's first name. It's apparently an Indonesian honorific.\nMysterious teen Ellie (Bella Ramsey) is immune to the fungal brain infection that has reduced much of the populace to savage cannibals, so smuggler partners Tess and Joel (Anna Torv and Pedro Pascal) have been tasked with delivering her to the rebel group known as the Fireflies. They hope to replicate Ellie's resistance and restore the world.\nThe episode's 2023 story sticks closely to the game, right down to Tess hiding the fact that she'd been bitten by one of the infected in the Bostonian Museum. They reach the Capitol Building and find the corpses of the Fireflies they were meant to bring Ellie to.\nTess reveals her wound, accepts that she's doomed and demands that a reluctant Joel bring Ellie to their buddies Bill and Frank, so they can help get Ellie to the Fireflies.\n\"You get her there. You keep her alive. And you set everything right,\" she says. \"All the shit we did. Please say yes, Joel, please.\"\nIn the game, soldiers of the authoritarian remnants of the US military arrive at the building and Tess stays behind to delay their adversaries. She's quickly gunned down, but her sacrifice gives Joel and Ellie the chance to escape.\nThe show, however, sees a horde of infected descend on the Capitol Building, and Tess stays behind to cover Joel and Ellie's escape. She dumps gas and grenades all over the floor.\n\"Joel, save who you can save,\" she says, prompting him to pull a struggling Ellie to safety.\nAs the infected rush in, Tess struggles to ignite the lighter and blow them all up. A particularly horribly mutated infected notices her and extends its tendrils from its mouth into hers. Series co-creator Neil Druckmann explained this unnerving scene to Entertainment Weekly.\n\"These things don't have to get violent unless you're fighting them from spreading [the infection] further,\" Druckmann said. \"That is realized in this beautiful, yet horrific way with [Tess].\"\nNever have I wanted a flame to ignite more. Much to our relief, she manages light the fire and closes her eyes before the explosion kills her and a bunch of infected. Ellie and Joel witness the blast from outside, and a quietly devastated Joel walks away.\nAddressing why the show uses infected for this moment instead of soldiers, Mazin told the Washington Post that it was unlikely soldiers would venture so deep into dangerous territory to chase down fugitives who'd probably get themselves killed anyway. The horde also reinforces the danger of the Cordyceps fungus just as it was revealed that Ellie could be the source of a cure.\nThis bleak tale continues on HBO Max next Sunday, Jan. 29.",

            "text": "A lot has been said about The Last of Us as a series since Part 2 released, and while I won’t get into the unwarranted controversy that game drew, I will say that, without a doubt, TLOU: Part 2 was one of the best-looking games of last generation. A few years have passed, and the drama had finally died down – until The Last of Us: Part 1 was announced, a current gen remake of the original PS3 game, which itself had been remastered for the PS4, sending fans into a frenzy yet again. “Cash grab”, “unnecessary”, “pointless”, were just a few words thrown around by naysayers, while others were legitimately excited for a remake, hoping that some of the advances made for Part 2 would find their way to Part 1. So, which side was correct? Well, it’s a little of both.\nLet me say that I am a huge fan of The Last of Us. The original blew me away when it was released and I completed the campaign more times than I can count, eventually obtaining the Platinum trophy after a grueling Grounded playthrough. Years later I became obsessed again with the remaster, this time focusing more on the overwhelmingly tense multiplayer rather than the campaign, although I did run through the campaign a few times just to experience the resoundingly well-written story once again. Sure, with a few years between playthroughs my rose-colored glasses had faded a bit and I was able to accept that there were a few flaws, namely in movement and combat, but even then, I still respected the game for the sheer experience I had unveiling the story for the first time.\nNow a few more years have passed, along with a sequel that many fans have a very strange love/hate relationship with. Gripes about the story aside – Part 2 was nearly universally praised for its upgraded combat mechanics, AI, graphics, and level structure. Fans had high hopes that the updates implemented in Part 2 would make their way into the Part 1 Remake, but unfortunately, that isn’t quite the case.\nFor those unaware, The Last of Us is set twenty years after a major virus outbreak, where many humans have either died or been infected with a fungal mutation which turns them into zombie-type creatures. The core gameplay revolves around survival, with players taking the role of Joel as he escorts Ellie, a 14-year-old girl, to meet up with the Fireflies, a militia set on overthrowing government rule and bringing power back to the people. As Joel you must scavenge to find items to craft weapons, upgrade your arsenal, and to have enough ammo for a fighting chance at survival all while taking down the infected and the humans you encounter along your journey. The Last of Us is a well-made game, with tense combat, fantastic dialogue – especially between Joel and Ellie as they get to know each other – and a 12-to-15-hour campaign. This release also contains fully remade DLC content in the form of Left Behind, which tells Ellie’s story before she met Joel and fills in a spot in the main narrative that was previously missing.\nWhile a technical marvel and incredibly impressive graphically, The Last of Us: Part 1 Remake plays much the same as it always has. The world, animations, and character models have all been improved to match modern standards and as such, this is easily one of the more impressive looking games on the PS5. But where fans clamored for improvements, few were implemented – aside from significantly improved AI. Enemies are now far more threatening, actively communicating with each other to flank and outwit Joel. I was constantly impressed watching the enemies’ reactions as they faced off with me. They would shout out where I was located, sneak around corners, and even peek around corners to catch a glimpse of my location, then work together to take me down. This led to far more tense and entertaining encounters than on previous releases. Thankfully, enemies aren’t the only ones who got AI improvements, as your teammates now provide better help during fights and are much better at hiding from enemies.\nOne of the most significant additions to this release is the slew of accessibility options added in hopes of making Part 1 playable for more people than ever before, and those alone may make this release worthwhile. But for someone who already has experienced The Last of Us on one, or even two previous console generations, the graphics, AI, and technical upgrades may not be enough to warrant a purchase.\nNaturally, this put me at a crossroads when it came to this review. As a huge fan of the series, I want nothing more than for players to experience the story – but as someone who has purchased the game twice before, I wouldn’t be comfortable purchasing it for a third time as it stands. On its own merits, The Last of Us is what I would consider essential playing for most gamers, and as such this is the best version of the core game available and absolutely worth taking for a spin if you are new to the series, but then there is the fact that this release contains less content than the previous remaster, as it is noticeably missing the multiplayer and multiplayer related DLC. So, do you prefer a well-made single player campaign with upgraded graphics compared to previous gen releases, and if so, are you willing to forgo the multiplayer component? If the answer to either of those questions is “yes”, then this is the version to pick up. If that answer is no, then this is not the release for you. As it stands, I recognize that this release is a significant upgrade in both graphical terms and AI and those two elements being improved may be enough to satisfy many gamers, I am just not one of them.\nI previously mentioned the accessibility options, and to say that what’s available is impressive is an understatement. There is a near endless choice of accessibility tech to choose from, including pre-set modes dedicated to providing the best possible experience for those with vision, hearing, or motor accessibility issues. Of course, despite what mode you choose, you can still further tweak the settings to suit the exact playstyle you require. Among these accessibility options are auto pick up, the ability to skip puzzles, navigation and traversal assistance, awareness indicators, cinematic descriptions, enhanced listen mode, lock on aim, auto weapon swap, ledge guard, infinite breath, help with melee combos, the ability to turn off weapon sway, combat vibration cues, invisibility toggle, and more.\nLike in previous releases, this version also contains a host of system settings to toggle, along with unlockable customization options, special features, and modifiers. Immediately upon launching the game for the first time you’ll be greeted by an option screen which allows you to toggle screen reader, which enables narration of on-screen text, and you can fiddle with the text and speech language settings. From there you are offered two modes: Performance and Fidelity. Performance mode provides balanced resolution and framerate, which – depending on video output system settings – offers either Dynamic 4K or 1440p with 60Hz shooting for a target of 60 fps, while Fidelity mode favors resolution over frame rate and targets 30 fps with 4K and 30Hz. While figuring out which mode is for you the game displays examples of shadows, midtones, and brights to help you make an informed choice. For the record, I played in Performance mode with HDR on, and all the review pictures and gameplay videos on our YouTube came from that setting as well. I tend to gravitate toward the mode which offers the most balance between settings, in this case Performance mode, and during my 15 hours with the game I experienced no issues with frame rate or performance in any manner.\nSubtitles have been given multiple options as well, allowing players to customize their size, color, background color, and whether the name of each speaker is shown. Additionally, you can toggle unique colors for each speaker to help better distinguish characters along with a choice to enable an arrow which will point in the direction of the character speaking. Audio settings include dynamic ranges which can be toggled between narrow and wider, with wider allowing for more of a volume increase between quiet and loud sounds while narrow provides less of a difference between sounds. There is also an option for mono audio which combines left and right channels.\nCompleting actions in-game will award you points which you can then spend to unlock items and behind-the-scenes features, some of which is locked until you complete the main campaign for the first time. There have been new cosmetics added, including clothing items which pay tribute to other major Sony titles, along with skins, a filter gallery, gameplay modifiers, concert art, and a model viewer. The behind-the-scenes features include a near two-hour long documentary detailing the creation of the game, along with another short video and four episodes of the official podcast, each about an hour long. Additionally, there is a speedrun recap which helps players better their playthrough time.\nWhile the unlockables are nice, most – aside from the modifiers – serve mainly as fluff. While fun to unlock and mess with for a few, most don’t actively contribute to the gameplay. Ellie and Joel have a variety of cosmetics to unlock, including outfits, backpacks, and gun skins with Ellie having a far more diverse roster of unlockables than Joel, who sticks mainly with new flannel shirts. Ellie can sport outfits ranging from what looks to be Uma Thurman’s yellow jumpsuit from Kill Bill to t-shirts with many of Naughty Dog and Sony’s major IPs on them. Additionally, there are around 30 graphical filters to obtain, which can be toggled on and off at will during gameplay to switch up the graphical style of the game. A few of the available filters include 8-bit, noir, watercolor, headache, and pop poster. While neat to check out for a few, the graphical filters serve more as a deterrent to gameplay than anything useful – essentially, they are cool to show off, but too distracting to be used during a full playthrough.\nModifiers are the only unlockable items which actively contribute to the gameplay. Ranging from simply mirroring the world upon death to full blown cheats, modifiers are the most interesting of the unlockables. Cheats include infinite ammo, infinite crafting, one shot kills, touch of death, exploding arrows, and more. These can be toggled on and off at will and allow you to make Joel a one-man army. It is quite fun to take everything out in one hit while shooting off infinite exploding arrows and just wreaking havoc, especially after the tension of constantly having low supplies and ammo throughout the base game.\nThe documentary Grounded is a thorough and well-made look at the creation of The Last of Us, from the first thoughts of creating a new IP through the game’s official release. The documentary takes time to dive into every aspect of the game’s creation, including casting, the anxiety of the first playthrough, the motion capture performances, crafting the story, and more. It is a resoundingly interesting documentary and worth watching. The other short documentary and podcasts are nice additions as well, providing a bit further depth to the items discussed in Grounded.\nAs you progress through the game, you are given the ability to replay any chapter or enemy encounter that you’ve already experienced, or to just re-watch any cutscene. Replaying encounters could be especially useful for those hoping to complete a successful permadeath run, as this mode offers an easy way to practice new approaches and determine the most efficient way to tackle a situation while using a minimal number of supplies.\nWhile the accessibility options and special features are nice, in the end it is still hard to ignore the fact that at this point we are getting into a remaster of a remaster, and no matter how incredible the base game is the technical prowess involved, with each release it becomes more difficult to recommend a purchase to players that have already experienced the story as by now this is essentially a more expensive version of the PS4 remaster which had more content, namely the superb multiplayer component. That said, I have tried my best to remove my own biases from this review and judge this release on its own merits, not by what I expected.\nGreat\nThe Last Of Us Part I\nAs a game, The Last of Us: Part 1 still deserves a high score after all these years, but I give that score hesitantly, as I am acutely aware that previous releases offer more content and that this release was not created for those who have already played through and enjoyed the game in the past, but rather to welcome in new players or for those who wish to harness the full power of their PS5. While this is the most technically impressive version of The Last of Us that we will likely ever get, it is anchored down by its previous releases, while simultaneously missing important components those versions had, namely the superb multiplayer. Despite some interesting bonus features, new cosmetic items, vastly improved AI, and a few quality-of-life changes, there may not be enough here to justify the purchase for anybody except newcomers. That said, the impressively robust suite of accessibility options is a welcome addition worthy of praise and will hopefully provide an opportunity for a new generation of fans to experience this story.\nPROS\n- Incredible graphical upgrade\n- Impressive accessibility options\n- Improved AI leads to more interesting encounters\n- Compelling narrative, especially if it’s your first time\nCONS\n- No real changes to gameplay aside from AI tweaks\n- The price tag may deter players from returning\n- Multiplayer cut from this release",

            "text": "It’s been almost a week since I beat The Last Of Us Part II, and I can’t get the specific image of one character’s face out of my head. Their expression haunts me. Even when I’m watching silly YouTube videos, making lunch or trying to get to sleep, I’ve found that my mind will inevitably wander towards it. I’ve tried to replace it by starting the game over or flitting through old screenshots, but nothing has worked. It’s stuck there, seemingly forever, a reminder of the consequences of my actions – whether I wanted to take them or not – in one of the most challenging video games I’ve ever played.\nThe Last Of Us Part II is a game about violence, and across 30 hours of difficult emotions, I went to war with my own preconceived notions of the characters that I had come to know in the first game – and formed unbreakable bonds with the sequel’s new blood.\nI lurched and shouted in distress at the TV, felt my head sway with nausea, grinned from ear to ear and subsequently cried my eyes out. At one point, half-recoiling from the screen due to the harrowing scene in front of me, I put the controller down and let the protagonist die because I was at odds with what the game was asking me to do.\nI didn’t want to play anymore if this was what it meant to continue. In the game over screen, I was begging for the game to give me an out. I wanted to find another way so that it didn’t have to be like this, but as with many of the ethically muddy situations that blindside you throughout The Last Of Us Part II, it was meant to be, and all I could do was stew in the malaise that followed.\nFor the die-hard fans of The Last Of Us – a game I personally wasn’t so enamoured with – many questioned whether a sequel was the right move, suggesting that the relatable tragedy of Joel and Ellie’s tale should be left in its critically acclaimed situ, never to be excavated. After finishing The Last Of Us Part II, I could not disagree more. This game justifies its existence very quickly, and serves as an essential coda to that story, unravelling its most ambiguous and heartbreaking threads, pushing its characters to the bitter end of their arcs. I much prefer it, but I’m not sure that Part II could exist or achieve what it has without the spectre of the original looming over it.\nAn extremely human level of depth is coaxed out by Naughty Dog through meticulous animations, playful smirks and perfectly awkward dialogue. Its script is full of the tricky conversations that we’ve all had in our past – the heart-racing playful banter in the early throes of a relationship and the forgotten arguments that sting when pulled to the front of our mind’s eye. You can tell that Naughty Dog has let the motion capture actors breathe and move around in a massive soundstage, giving them the room to emote, riff and feel these lines – there are scenes without words that say so much more.\nIt goes without saying that it looks good – as far as photorealism is concerned, The Last Of Us Part II is the best-looking game of the generation, with its nose crinkles, worn fretboards and overgrown post-apocalyptic suburbs. I could write 2,000 words about the muscular arms of one of the game’s new characters, the individual raindrops that stream down Ellie’s face or the way horses crunch through shallow ice in a frostbitten stream, but you know all of this already if you’ve seen the trailers. The detailing is beyond absurd, and that extends to the game’s main focus – its violence.\nThere will be plenty of thesaurus–diving to convey the detail behind The Last Of Us Part II’s violence, but none of it will be able to depict just how traumatic the experience is when you go hands-on. Combat feels purposefully desperate – like you’re seconds from death at any given moment.\nEllie is an absolute warrior, but she’s also just as vulnerable as any other human born into such an unforgiving situation. The way people fight in this post-apocalypse reflects the speed in which they were forced to adapt to it – they won’t think about punching your head into a garage door or sticking a finger in your eye socket to get out of a grapple. If you run at them like blockhead bullet sponge Nathan Drake, they will bury you in lead quicker than you can say ragdoll.\nThese survivors are hungry, angry and afraid – and the only way they can wrest control in this lawless dystopia is through physical dominance. This concept is realised well via the game’s main factions, the crypto-fascist Washington Liberation Front and the zealous Seraphites, a religious cult who have regressed into the technological past to thrive in a situation where mastery of land can be a greater tool than any high-calibre rifle. They whistle to communicate to each other in battle, stripping you of the chance to understand their intentions as an arrow pierces your abdomen and a claw hammer slams into your temple.\nThe combat is, by all means, exhilarating – the best system Naughty Dog has yet produced. Even the gimmicks like naming enemies land when the situation allows for it, as WLF Soldiers shriek the names of their friends and lovers in anguish after they see their torso severed from their waist by one of Ellie’s trip mines.\nOne of the game’s most significant improvements on the original is its refined approach to survival horror – with such desperate, grisly bloodsport at stake, every Clicker encounter will slick your palms and make you shiver in fear. You can taste the atmosphere when the game throws you into a spore den, and the sickly new monster designs create overwhelming situations where you’ll be forced into action to delay their intelligent pathing from outwitting Ellie and stealing her jugular.\nIt all sounds very gratuitous, and as I pressed through the game, I thought that it would be impossible for Naughty Dog to create such grisly viscera systems without realising the need to address such dissonance in the game’s plot, and I’m pleased to say that this is something it manages to pull off across the course of the story.\nWithout saying too much, The Last Of Us Part II uses these systems to its own benefit, with Westworld alum Halley Gross brought on board to weave an incredible narrative about the lengths people go to justify revenge under the duress of trauma, and how Sisyphean cycles of brutality slowly tear relationships apart.\nYet despite its nauseating violence, The Last Of Us Part II is bursting with heart, and many of its character arcs serve as empathy vehicles to help break down draconian societal sensibilities. Discussion of the game’s queer representation should be left to writers other than myself, but the thoughtful stories that underpin these new characters moved me greatly.\nMusic and its memory-making power are also of paramount importance to The Last Of Us Part II story, and its emotional atmosphere is complemented by some immaculate acoustic guitar fingering from series composer Gustavo Santaolalla.\nAs such, the recurring motif of a virtual acoustic guitar in Part II is a wounding aside, with every heart-rending pluck of the simulated strings feeling even more difficult than the last given the distance between each play session. I’d often lose hours sitting and strumming out chords to some of my favourite songs when the game gave me the chance to blow off some steam.\nOne genius turn is making it so that the game’s most significant surprises don’t arrive after hours of build-up – most often, they happen as they would in real life, at the moment, and rob the player of a pause to process the trauma. This really cranks the immersion to incredible heights, yet when the game does take its foot off the pedal, it’s just as effective. I recall feeling like a smitten third wheel (in the best way possible) as Dina and Ellie slowly flirted their way through a decaying downtown Seattle. Similarly, later in the story, all it took was one agonising note to a forgotten father found on a decaying corpse to summon an unexpected flurry of tears – in an otherwise light-hearted section of the game.\nThe Last Of Us Part II will be available on PlayStation 4 on June 19.\nOur Verdict\nThe Last Of Us Part II is a purposefully challenging game that spans the entire emotional spectrum, one that will force you to reconsider your preconceived ideas about the beloved original. It’s a vicious thrill ride that is not for the faint of heart, but the gratuitous, guttural depths of its violence do not exist without a cause. The harrowing combat and thick atmosphere make for adrenaline-pumping gameplay. Still, the dissonance works to serve a higher moral told with heartbreaking humanity by a cast of sophisticated but charming characters who are all saddled with the consequences of unimaginable tragedy. It’s a humbling game that never feels like a slog across 30 hours of play – one that every PlayStation 4 owner should experience.\nPros\n- Tremendous narrative that will have you at the edge of your seat\n- Incredible, photo-realistic graphics; the best-looking game of the generation\n- Combat is challenging, so you feel like you’re simply sailing to the end of the narrative\n- Stellar cast acting that rounds of a spectacular video game\nCons\n- None that we can point out",

            "text": "‘The Last of Us’ Season 2: Here’s What to Expect\nThis post contains spoilers for season one of HBO’s The Last of Us, as well as minor spoilers for The Last of Us Part II (PlayStation 4).\nIt’s official – the first season of HBO’s The Last of Us has come to an end, leaving viewers (8.2M to be exact) teary-eyed and adrift, wondering what’s next. After all, the television adaptation closed out in near-identical fashion to its video game inspiration with an extremely ambiguous ending — one that fans of the game debated for the better part of a decade. But with Season Two hopefully beginning to film later this year, new audiences shouldn’t have to endure the seven-year wait players did between Parts I and II of the PlayStation original.\nRelated\nBut where does the story go from here? Here’s what we know based on both Season One of the show and the source material.\nNew Settings and Players\nDesigned as a Jack Kerouac-esque American odyssey, Season One of the show brought Joel and Ellie on a cross-country road trip from Boston to Salt Lake City, with some pit stops along the way. But in the end, they make their way back to Jackson, Wyoming, where they intend to settle down. Given the tenuous nature of their relationship in the final scene, it’s fair for fans to wonder if they’ll actually be able to make a life there. But there’s a roadmap.\nShowrunners Craig Mazin and Neil Druckmann have already stated that Season Two (and likely three) will follow the second game in the series, 2020’s The Last of Us Part II. Without spoiling much, that game picks up five years after the ending of the first game, and the show’s current endpoint. Ellie is a little older, more mature and at 19, the current age of series star Bella Ramsey. Expect a little work to be done in the costume design and makeup department to give older Ellie that college undergrad-meets-apocalypse vibe (including the mandatory early adulthood tattoo). Joel, too, ages some, but not in any ways that should threaten his mantle as TV’s internet daddy.\nEditor’s picks\nSome of the biggest changes will come from the introduction of new characters, all of whom will play crucial roles in expanding the world of The Last of Us. The adaptation already has a leg up in this department by spending more time on supporting players in Season One than the game ever did, but Season Two will up the roster of recurring characters in ways that go beyond the somewhat slice-of-life vignette style of the initial outing. Putting it another way, not every guest star will be introduced only to exit the story (or this mortal plane) by the next episode.\nOne of the famously controversial shifts from The Last of Us Part I to Part II was the addition of more playable characters beyond Joel and Ellie. As a device, it opened up the world in surprising and terrifying ways, allowing players to experience different perspectives.\nThe showrunners have already laid the groundwork for this in Season One by shifting perspectives to supporting characters like Bill and Frank, Henry and Sam, as well as the opposition with Kathryn. Through this, viewers are already trained for more multi-faceted storytelling in ways that gamers weren’t quite prepared for in 2020.\nAn Expansive Scope\nThe enlarged character roster will bring a massively expanded scope. The story of The Last of Us is often spoken of as a masterful execution of simplicity. It’s linear, following a year’s time through four seasons, each broken down into smaller chapters or vignettes — a structure the show has followed to a tee (as a fan, I was able to accurately guess the content covered in each of the nine episodes before ever seeing the premiere). And by removing all the gameplay encounters and merging some similar narrative beats, the showrunners were able to streamline the entire first game into just nine episodes with unbelievable accuracy.\nNarratively, the second game is roughly twice the length of the first, and we already know that the adaptation will spread that story across multiple seasons. The story of Part II could comfortably span two seasons with the same kind of faithfulness seen the first time around.\nThe showrunners have also gone on record stating that they don’t intend to invent more story outside of the games, and there’s been no official announcement of a third installment. With that, fans may want to prepare for a show that adheres to HBO’s respect for brevity and willingness to allow series to end when the creators see fit (see: Watchmen, Succession) rather than artificially dragging it on forever (see: anything on Showtime).\nThe biggest mysteries lie in storytelling structure. Unlike the first game’s linear story, the second follows a more novelistic approach with sprawling multi-act narratives told from multiple overlapping perspectives and some major rug-pull moments that consistently recontextualize things the player has already experienced.\nIt’s a much more complicated story in both format and content and, although not as intentionally obtuse as something like Westworld, could test the patience of some viewers. It’s entirely plausible that we could see something closer to what fans loved about HBO’s other monster hit Game of Thrones: multiple branching narrative threads following different individuals or groups that play out parallel to each other on a collision course.\nThis is speculative, of course, but given the downright slavish devotion to the source material, it’s safe to assume that there will be some kind of major shakeup to the formula.\nFamiliar Themes\nOne of the most pervasive themes of the first season is the duality of love. It can be our salvation or destruction (sometimes both). Whereas much of this exists in the first game as subtext — as did certain characters’ sexual identity — it’s front and center in the sequel.\nIn retrospect, the second game, released in 2020, feels like co-creator Neil Druckmann coming to terms with being more open about his intended themes in way that would later inform the HBO series. What might’ve required a Trojan horse in 2013 is fair game in 2023.\nSpoilers aside, fans can expect the same tear-inducing highs and sorrowful lows as the first season, but amplified as the story goes bigger, better, and harder on all of the themes that built the foundation for the first season. Viewers should expect to see an evolution of the themes in Season One — the prism through which love impacts us all — as well as the consequences for perpetuating cycles of violence.\nGoing back to the notion of subtext, one of the best additions to the show from the game was a willingness to be overt about sexuality with characters like Bill and Frank, as well as create space for new characters of diverse ethnic and racial makeups (Florence and Marlon). Part II famously made strides in this area, building out a supporting cast of characters across the spectrum, including major players that deliver deeper representation from the LGBTQIA+ community.\nSeason One arrived at a time when trans rights are being actively threatened across the nation, and The Last of Us Season Two will likely arrive at a time when representation and the protection of trans rights as human rights will be more timely than ever before.\nNew Forms of Infected\nBesides its compelling plot and fantastic characterization, one of the best aspects of Season One was the phenomenally-realized Infected brought to life. They were so impactful that some viewers felt they hadn’t seen enough of them. It’s true that the showrunners pulled back on the Infected, using them sparingly for maximum effect but, in a recent interview, they promised that we’ll be seeing much more of them moving forward.\nWhat will we see exactly? In the first season, the primary form of Infected shown were the visceral waves of “Runners” (stock zombie type) and of course the series mascot/nightmare fuel, the “Clickers.” In Episode Five, as part of the show’s largest set piece, we also get an up-close-and-personal look at the giant “Bloater” who makes short work of Perry’s skull. But could there be something even worse?\nThe Last of Us Part II featured a number of new types of Infected, including the stealthy and nimble “Stalkers” who could add another layer of horror as they silently appear from just about anywhere, unlike their noisier brethren.\nAnd while we’ll save the best secrets for the show itself, there may be some things that are bigger and infinitely more grotesque than Bloaters — things that will bring a Cronenbergian sense of horror and physical disgust that will cause many sleepless nights post-air.\nBut as we all know, the true horrors of The Last of Us stem not from the literal monsters, but the monsters within. So expect to see more groups of raiders, the return of FEDRA, militias and rebels, and entirely new factions who will lean into social constructs and moral conundrums not yet explored by the show.\nConsequences and the Cycle of Violence\nLastly, what can we expect from both the physical and emotional fallout of Season One? In his paternal rage, Joel carved a bloody path through an entire platoon of Fireflies in Salt Lake City before executing their leader, Marlene. Whether or not he was justified, that will not be forgotten.\nThe show has been very good at organically weaving in teasers and Easter eggs for Season Two, primarily for series veterans, but many astute first-time viewers have picked up the trail as well. Who was the young woman curiously gazing at Ellie during her first visit to Jackson? Why did the camera hold for so long on the executed surgeon during Joel’s Salt Lake City massacre? Will Ellie ever learn to play guitar!?\nOn its arrival, Part II was an extremely divisive game that became embroiled in a flashpoint moment post-GamerGate, firmly entrenched in a Trump-struck world. Setting aside the trolls and bad-faith arguments, much of the backlash came from the fact that the sequel was inherently a response to and a deconstruction of the beloved first game.\nWhile Part I told a layered story of moral dubiousness, many players opted to take it at surface value, eschewing all nuance and subtext about the dangerous line between love and obsession, and how violence is perpetuated.\nThey had no such luxury with the second game, which took aim at the characters’ actions as well as the player’s own complacency in the violent proceedings.\nGiven how much of that subtext became actual text in the transition from PlayStation to HBO, there’s comfort in the fact that the next season shouldn’t be as jarring to television viewers as it was to gamers, as these questions of moral ambiguity have already bubbled to the surface in Season One.\nSo when can we expect Season Two? Likely not for a long time. It was announced immediately after the second episode’s premiere, and there’s hope that it may begin filming as soon as this year, but given the level of craftsmanship that went into the first season (the giraffe was real), a premiere date could be anyone’s guess.\nTrending\nNeil Young and Stephen Stills Honor David Crosby, Revive Buffalo Springfield at Light Up The Blues\n‘Succession’: The Roy Siblings Meet Their Match in Alexander Skarsgård’s Lukas Matsson\nOK, Seriously, What Was Frank Ocean's Deal at Coachella?\nUnhinged Lindsey Graham Yells, Spews Lies About Abortion\nThe silver lining is that the longer production cycles may give developer Naughty Dog more time to work on a hypothetically third installment in the series, which they may or may not be doing.\nUntil then, fans will just have to endure and survive.",

            "text": "SPOILER ALERT: This interview contains spoilers from Episode 6 of “The Last of Us,” now streaming on HBO Max.\nHBO’s “The Last of Us” series just took a major leap to the video game’s sequel, “The Last of Us: Part II,” that fans are sure to recognize: The snowy Jackson, Wyoming, settlement where “Part II” begins was faithfully recreated in Episode 6 — despite not appearing in the original game.\nIt’s the first major connection to “Part II” that the show has made. Without spoiling the events of the sequel, the wintery Jackson town is a major location in the opening hours of the game. In the original “The Last of Us,” players learn about Jackson from Tommy (Gabriel Luna) and Maria (Rutina Wesley), but they mainly stay at the hydroelectric dam encampment and see Jackson only at a distance. The section of the game also takes place during the fall, not the winter.\nHBO has already renewed “The Last of Us” for Season 2, which seems like a perfect opportunity to return to this established Jackson set for the sequel’s story. This version of Jackson, however, was actually created in Canmore, a small town 50 miles west of Calgary, in Alberta, Canada, where much of “The Last of Us” was filmed.\nFilmmaker Jasmila Žbanić, born in Sarajevo, Bosnia, made her TV directorial debut with Episode 6, titled “Kin.” Her most recent film, “Quo Vadis, Aida?,” was nominated for best international feature at the 2021 Academy Awards. It dramatized the harrowing events of the Srebrenica massacre in 1995, when more than 8,000 Bosnian men were killed during the Bosnian War of the 1990s. Žbanić’s experience surviving the Siege of Sarajevo during the war influenced how she directed the episode, in which Joel (Pedro Pascal) is reunited with his brother Tommy in the burgeoning Jackson settlement.\n“There was no electricity, no food, nothing. But we managed to survive because of solidarity and the way the city was restructured. You have to start from zero. That experience for me was something that I felt very close about Jackson,” Žbanić said, adding that “The Last of Us” creators Neil Druckmann and Craig Mazin were interested in her background as it related to the episode.\nWith Variety, Žbanić discussed the below-freezing temperatures in Canmore, filming the highly emotional reunion between Joel and Tommy and why working with the animal handlers on set was “heaven.”\nHow familiar with the video game were you? Did you watch videos of “The Last of Us: Part II” to understand what Jackson looked like?\nWhen I got the job, I didn’t know anything about the game, so I had to really educate myself with what it is. I bought the game and I tried to play it, and then I watched a lot of YouTube videos of people playing it. I was watching the part that concerns my episode a million times. I was talking a lot with Neil about all the atmosphere of the city and what he had in mind, and what is also not there. There are some elements that Craig added to the whole piece. I was also talking to a lot of gamers. I always ask, “What do they want to see? What do you expect from the game?” They would be saying to keep these emotions and atmosphere. These two things were like a checklist for me. I would check with each scene that they’re there.\nDid you talk with creators Druckmann and Mazin about why they wanted to incorporate Jackson from “Part II” into this episode?\nI didn’t really talk about it, because for me it was very natural. What we talked a lot about was that I survived the war in Sarajevo in the ’90s. I think for Craig and Neil, it was interesting that I was kind of living in a place which was like Jackson in a way, because we were surrounded by the Serbian army, we were constantly bombarded. We had to be on alert, we had to survive, we had to learn how to live without anything, without civilization. There was no electricity, no food, nothing. But we managed to survive because of solidarity, and the way the city was restructured. You have to start from zero. That experience for me was something that I felt very close about Jackson. It’s a community that functions, and I find it really beautiful and hopeful because I really believe even in the worst catastrophes, like war, I survived. People are able to keep the society. They are not always the enemy to each other. So I was really happy to direct this episode that really said something that I deeply believe in.\nThe reunion between Joel and Tommy was so sweet, but their relationship turns very rocky. What direction did you give them to portray this up-and-down, brotherly relationship?\nWe were very lucky because we had the opportunity to have rehearsals before we were on the set. The set was quite difficult because of the cold weather. Sometimes it was even -15 degrees Celsius, so very, very cold. That scene with Tommy and Joel was especially taken care of. They would be reading it, act, repeat and trying different stuff. They also suggested some changes, so it was very deep for both of them in each scene. It was so beautiful, because it’s a very long scene in the shoe shop. It’s a very emotional scene for Pedro. I was filming him as a second; first we filmed Gabriel, and then I noticed that each time we repeated, Pedro was crying. He was not on camera, but he was crying because he was giving his partner everything so that he can act. This is very special. It’s so generous of an actor to do this so deep. I was amazed by Pedro’s talent.\nHow did the “I sure as hell ain’t your dad” scene between Pedro and Bella go?\nIt was so emotional. Sometimes I would be crying behind the camera because they were so truthful and beautiful. This relationship is so touching. I really like that it’s changing from the beginning to the end. It’s just one episode, but it has so many changes of their relationship, which is really great.\nThere’s the flashback to Joel and Sarah putting up Christmas ornaments, which wasn’t in the original game. Where did that scene come from?\nI think the moment came out after Craig and I talked about certain things, how Joel is always trying not to connect his emotions toward Ellie with emotions that he has for Sarah because he buried those. It’s really hard for him when they come up. Ellie is just bringing everything out. Because of this kind of Christmas atmosphere in Jackson, songs that he hears, all the lights and feeling of normality, he’s not able to keep it in anymore. It’s out. That’s where he starts connecting, “OK, these emotions are real, and it is for her.”\nWith the freezing temperatures and all the animals, were there any obstacles that came up in shooting?\nLook, I’m coming from Bosnia, from a very crazy film industry. We make one film per year. So we don’t have amazing professionals like America has. So for me, nothing was a challenge, but a gift. For example, I would talk to people who were dog trainers and they would tell me, “Make a script of what you want our dog to do.” I would say, “One leg up, this face, how much the dog should open its mouth.” Everything. Then they would come with that and the dog would know it exactly. I was joking that in Bosnia it wouldn’t be possible. You would have a dog, and if the dog is angry, it’s angry. There is nothing like that. For me, all of this was not a challenge, but a total pleasure to work with such professionals. The people dealing with horses were amazing. You just tell them, “I want the first horse one meter away from the second, then three of them.” They would do it and keep it all the way through the scene. For me, it was just heaven to work this way.\nIn the game, Joel falls off a balcony and gets impaled on a piece of metal, but in this episode he gets stabbed. Why was that changed?\nI got it in the script, and I really liked it because it was more subtle. Ellie thinks they made it, and then it’s a shock. Otherwise it would be immediately over. I really liked how Craig wrote it. They travel, she’s hopeful, they go on together — and then it’s a shock.\nAnd the other major change is that Tommy and Maria are expecting a child. How do you think that will end up for them in the apocalypse?\nWe wanted to give this feeling of hope that this society has. Life doesn’t stop. It always goes on; even in the worst circumstances, life goes on. For me, this is a really important touch that Maria is pregnant. It makes Tommy’s decision much, much heavier that he accepted to take Ellie. It makes everything hard, with more drama for Tommy.\nThis interview has been edited and condensed.",

            "text": "The Last of Us Episode 2 review: Clickers and tragedy strike\nThe Last of Us TV series is already a massive hit for HBO\nThe Last of Us Episode 2 builds on the tragedy, suspense, and horror of the show’s opener by adapting one of the key moments from the game: the museum and its clicking terrors.\nEpisode 1 of HBO’s adaptation has already positioned itself as one of TV’s biggest juggernauts in 2023. It wouldn’t be appropriate to say it defied the odds: the talent speaks for itself, and the video game curse has been broken.\nIn less than 90 minutes, it managed to expand upon and nail the game’s harrowing opening, effectively explain the Cordyceps infection, and set up Joel (Pedro Pascal), Ellie (Bella Ramsey), and Tess (Anna Torv) on their journey outside the Boston quarantine zone.\nWith Episode 2, the stakes are raised by the perils beyond the wall, and it’s reminiscent of Game of Thrones’ best quality: even when the characters barely go anywhere, we learn more about them and what makes them tick… or click. Spoilers for The Last of Us Episode 2 to follow…\nThe Last of Us Episode 2: Another chilling prologue\nWe’re thrown back to 2003, two days before the outbreak. This time, we’re in Jakarta, the source of the fungus in the show. All seems well in the city; people are gambling, eating, and driving, hustling and bustling – but the wails of sirens can be heard in the normal current of life.\nPolice officers descend upon a cafe, where a seemingly random woman is finishing her lunch. This is Ibu Ratna, a professor of mycology at the University of Indonesia. They need her to examine a woman’s body, one with a bullet hole in her head and bite mark on her leg.\nWhen she cuts open the wound, mold seeps out like grew cotton wool. When she sticks some tongs into her throat, she pulls out tendrils looking to curl their way onto anything with a pulse.\nThe police officer explains that they took other victims away for observation, but were forced to execute them – and the person who bit them is still on the loose. He asks Ibu to help them. “I have spent my life studying these things, so please listen carefully: there is no medicine, no vaccine. Bomb. Start bombing. Bomb this city and everyone in it.”\nThe Last of Us Episode 2: Joel and Tess interrogate Ellie\nAt the end of Episode 1, Joel beat a FEDRA guard to death after he tried to test Ellie for Cordyceps. The screen claimed she was infected, but Ellie was bitten three weeks prior and has shown no signs of turning.\nShe wakes up on a patch of grass in a ruined building, the sun shining down through the wreckage of the building. Joel and Tess aren’t so relaxed, and begin quizzing her on everything they can about her bite. “It’s not getting any worse, is it?” Ellie says.\nA compelling, evolving dynamic is established between Joel and Tess: the former, recovering from the rage of the previous episode’s climax, wants to stop acting like Ellie has “some kinda life in front of her”; the latter is visibly taken aback by Ellie’s situation, and sees it as a chance to right the wrongs their brutal actions over the past decade.\nImportantly, Joel and Ellie’s relationship is humorously developed. “There’s not anything bad in here,” she asks as she goes into a room to pee. “Just you,” Joel quips. When she asks for a gun, he firmly says no. “Okay, jeez, fine, I’ll throw a f*cking sandwich at them,” she replies. Pascal is playing him more frostily than Baker in the game, while Ramsey effortlessly embodies Ellie as we already knew her.\nSubscribe to our newsletter for the latest updates on Esports, Gaming and more.\nThe Last of Us Episode 2: The Clickers are here\nThe game lends itself to characters being conversational; scenes don’t cut ahead, you progress them with your own movements, so they need to fill the void with chatter. In return, we grow closer to them. Episode 2 allows itself a few quiet moments for talking, whether it’s Tess learning about Ellie’s age, Ellie slyly avoiding any mention of Riley (if you don’t know, it’s best to wait), or Ellie trying (and failing) to probe Joel on his past.\nIn order to get through to the Boston Capitol building, the trio are forced to take a shorter way, as the safer route is overrun by hundreds of infected, all connected by the overgrown fungus running throughout the streets and underground, with threads as long as a mile. This means one thing: going into the Bostonian Museum.\nAnyone who’s played the game will let out a soft gulp here. It’s not quite the hotel basement (again, it’s best to wait if you don’t know), but newcomers will see the most terrifying monsters in all of The Last of Us for the first time: Clickers, a deformed breed infected with fungus all across their face, left blind, crazed, and with jagged teeth from the infection.\nThe ensuing set-piece is nail-biting, managing to represent the butt-clenching tension of tip-toeing past them and eventually ruining everything with one stumble. The noise, somewhere between clicking and a screech, is nightmare-worthy. Bullets end up flying, but with the exception of a small bite on Ellie, they all seem to emerge unscathed.\nThe Last of Us Episode 2: Tess’ luck runs out\nWhen they arrive at the Capitol building, they find nothing but boxes of gear and dead, bloody bodies. “One of them got bit, the healthy ones fought the sick ones, and everyone lost,” Joel tells Ellie, but while he seems fairly accepting of this being a sign to go home, Tess desperately tries to think of a solution.\nI knew it was coming. Many of you did. But for those who didn’t, Tess was bitten in the neck by a Clicker, and the infection is starting to run its course. “Our luck had to run out sometime,” she tells Joel.\nShe gives Joel her last wish: she wants him to take Ellie to Bill and Frank’s, and “save who you can save.” On the ground, a nearby corpse suddenly crawls forward, and Joel shoots him in the head – but one death begets a horde, as the vibration of the gunshot is felt along the vast network of fungi, and hundreds of infected start sprinting their way.\nJoel grabs Ellie, and Tess awaits a fiery death surrounded by fuel and grenades – but her lighter won’t work, even as an infected gives her a horrid, yucky kiss of death, with tendrils going into her mouth and down her throat. At the last moment, it comes alight, and she sacrifices herself in the explosion.\nThe Last of Us Episode 2 review score: 4/5\nA giddy episode for the players, and a terrifying experience for all, The Last of Us Episode 2 proves its first chapter wasn’t a one-off. Nobody is safe in the Cordyceps apocalypse, and it’s best we all accept this before reaching the heaviest hits.\nThe Last of Us Episode 3 will be available to watch on January 29 in the US and January 30 in the UK.

            "text": "If your patience is understandably thin these days, then let’s make one thing perfectly clear: The Last of Us Part II is a modern-day masterpiece, a haunting and beautiful story that will grab hold of something deep inside of you until long after the credits roll. Not only is it a worthy successor to the original, but it’s one of the finest sequels I’ve played. The hype is real. It’s that good.\nThat’s the short review. Here’s a slightly longer one if you’re into that sort of thing. While I will endeavor to avoid any and all spoilers, please proceed at your own peril because lord only knows what people consider to be a spoiler nowadays.\nFollowing up a critically acclaimed game like The Last of Us is no easy task. When you consider that for many gamers—myself included—it ranks highly on the Best Games of All Time list, making a sequel begins to feel downright Sisyphean. But the developers and storytellers at Naughty Dog are used to the crushing weight of lofty expectations, and once again they have made something truly special. It not only stands on its own but enhances the original work too. Impeccable gameplay, gripping storytelling, astonishing graphics, and fastidious attention to detail make this one of the defining works of the PlayStation 4 era. One of the biggest reasons, though, is that Naughty Dog uses The Last of Us Part II to explore deeply human experiences and push them to their logical and emotional extremes.\nGrief is a paradox, simultaneously a powerful, catalyzing force for change and stasis. It sinks deep into your body, wrapping its icy claws around your heart, alternately numbing you to the world around you and tearing your soul asunder as you try to grapple with your new reality. Sometimes it causes us to retreat inwards, withdrawing from our loved ones as we lumber around like a depression golem, merely drifting from moment to moment.\nOther times it fills us with righteous anger, which can take the form of a perfectly crafted invective against someone like LAPD chief Michael Moore. But worst of all is when that grief fills you with the kind of unbridled rage that seemingly can’t be quelled by anything other than violence. The Last of Us Part II plumbs the depths of this particular raw emotional state—that inescapable feeling of seeing red—better than any other piece of media I have encountered.\nAs I learned last September when my father passed away, you cannot control when these feelings strike you, and I found myself reacting viscerally to the beautiful, tragic, and harrowing saga of Ellie and Joel in The Last of Us Part II. Multiple moments in this staggeringly good game reduced me to a weepy pile of tears on my couch. Not only because of its poignant, frequently shocking narrative, but because of the elemental experience to which it speaks. Whereas the original The Last of Us dissected the morality of unconditional love and the incredible lengths we would go to for our friends and family, The Last of Us Part II asks what lengths we’re willing to go to for hate, anger, and revenge. This is a story of unconditional hate and the consequences of allows it to consume us.\n“I want to talk about this idea of rage and anger and hate, and how close it can be actually to love,” said co-director Neil Druckmann during a hands-on preview event last September. “What happens if something bad happens to someone you love? A significant other, a family member, a best friend … How far would you go to make the people responsible for that [pay]? What are the costs of that? What are the costs of an eye for an eye?”\n“a haunting and beautiful story that will grab hold of something deep inside of you until long after the credits roll.”\nThat was two weeks after my father passed away and Druckmann’s words really sunk in. I found myself thinking about them often in the days and weeks that followed, but especially so as I played through The Last of Us Part II‘s twisting, turning, non-linear narrative. While the primary events of Part II take place over roughly a three-day span of time, the game often jumps back and forward in time, giving you fresh insights and perspectives from unexpected characters that give previous moments new meaning and profound resonance. It’s a bold experiment that could derail a game without as clear-eyed a vision as Naughty Dog’s, but it manages to keep you on tenterhooks even when you feel like you know what is coming.\nSet 25 years after Infection Day, Ellie (Ashley Johnson) is no longer a child. After Joel (Troy Baker) and she survived endless horrors in the first game, Ellie, now 19 years old, has achieved something resembling normalcy in a world where a fungal infection ravaged the planet, turning much of humanity into blood-thirsty, mutated monsters. Living in a bustling community of survivors in Jackson County, Colorado, Ellie and Joel have drifted apart in the way that many teenagers do from their parents as they try to carve out an identity for themselves. New friends like Jesse (Stephen A. Chang) and Dina (Shannon Woodward)—as well as mentions of others in Ellie’s journal—paint a picture of a life that is full of potential, a flower blooming in the ruins of the old world.\n“Impeccable gameplay, gripping storytelling, astonishing graphics, and fastidious attention to detail.”\nBut all of that potential and hope is obliterated when the unthinkable happens. An unspeakable act of violence irrevocably changes the course of Ellie’s life and sets her on a course towards Seattle where she seeks vengeance and winds up embroiled in a much larger conflict between a radical paramilitary group and a mysterious cult. What follows fundamentally changes Ellie as we see the emotional, spiritual, and physical toll it takes on her over the course of her brutal, relentless odyssey into the heart of darkness.\nThat isn’t to say that The Last of Us Part II is a hopeless game. Quite the opposite, in fact, as the game has quite a bit to say about what we do in our darkest moments and the impulses to which we succumb. Despite these pervasive moments of despair, there is a light at the end of the tunnel and a cause for serious introspection as you, the player, must guide Ellie along this precipice of self-destruction.\nThe Last of Us Part II, much like its predecessor, deftly darts back and forth between action-adventure and survival horror as you navigate the world’s many horrors, both human and monstrous. The game’s vastly improved AI and new enemy types—like guard dogs, which track your scent, and fleshy abominations like the Shambler, which spew clouds of noxious, sight-obscuring smoke—will keep you constantly on your toes and your pulse racing as you survive another encounter by the skin of your teeth. But where the game truly shines is in the details, the seamless and almost invisible ways in which Naughty Dog creates a living, breathing ruined world.\nFrom the haunting sound design of Clickers blindly screaming in the distance to the crunch of snow beneath your feet, from the way light diffuses through the trees of a lush forest to the apocalyptic glare of a raging inferno, from the 60+ accessibility options to make this experience available to as wide a range of people as possible to the endless little collectibles and discoveries waiting around every corner, from the abandoned game of Dungeons & Dragons in a dilapidated apartment to the silly dad jokes Ellie cracks along the way to lighten the mood, The Last of Us is a towering achievement.\nThis is, of course, to say nothing of the incredible performances not only returning favorites like Ashley Johnson as Ellie and Troy Baker as Joel, but series newcomers Shannon Woodward as Dina, Stephen A. Chang as Jesse, Laura Bailey as Abby, and Patrick Fugit as Owen, whose performances are as good if not better than what you’d see in any prestige TV series. There’s so much more I want to say about this game, especially about Laura Bailey’s performance as Abby, but this is a journey best taken unspoiled.\nThe Last of Us Part II, by its director’s own admission, is not for everyone. You may not like it as much as I did. It may not make you cry as it made me. And you may not be as consistently awestruck over the course of its journey. But I urge you to give it a chance because if nothing else, you will appreciate how much love, care, and incredible craftsmanship went into making. And just know that I am jealous of you because to play this game for the first time is a gift in and of itself.\nRating: 5 out of 5\nThe Last of Us Part II is available on June 19, 2020 on PlayStation 4.\nImages: Sony / Naughty Dog\nDan Casey is the creative director of Nerdist and the author of books about the Avengers and Star Wars.

            "text": "In 2013, seven long years ago, developer Naughty Dog released The Last Of Us. It was a literary story with an elegant simplicity that resonated well beyond the often insular world of video games. Two people, four seasons, one journey. It depicted a ruined America, crumbled in the wake of a fungal virus outbreak. Its ending was deemed one of the best ever. Untouchable. Self-contained. Dare I say perfect.\nSo Part II arrives with the sky-high hurdle of its predecessor to surmount. Yes, it may be an exquisitely designed, masterfully realised game, released with all the technological know-how accrued over the many years of making games for the PS4. And, yes, it is many measures more “fun” than the original, providing more flexible systems to engage in dynamic combat and puzzle solving. But, it has a point to prove, a question to answer: why the hell does it even exist?\nShop The Last Of Us Part II. £49.99. At amazon.co.uk and game.co.uk\nIn truth, The Last Of Us Part II does not rush to answer that question. It does not rush much at all. It is slow, it is patient and it does not reveal its most unique strengths until you are well into its long adventure. There is a statistic I love and amazes me that only 40 per cent of Uncharted 4 (AKA Naughty Dog’s last game) players actually reached the end credits. If the same is true for Part II, most people will miss out on its most crucial and captivating storytelling moments. By its journey’s end, this game cements itself as a more accomplished project than its predecessor.\nPicking up five years later, America is still in ruins. The infectious fungus, cordyceps, that wrought this horror remains a mortal danger to anyone who comes into contact with its lethal spores, which transform their victims into bloodthirsty cadavers. Nevertheless there are semblances of rebuilding what was lost, especially in the town of Jackson, where beloved protagonists Joel and Ellie reside. It’s a glimpse of a part of a world we have not seen before and one Naughty Dog goes every inch of the way to make us feel warm and comforted by. You simply do not want to leave the walled safety of this place, for you know what awaits you beyond.\nAs the game’s journey inevitably branches out into the fallen, flooded and f****d cities of America, Part II begins to morph itself into something more complex. Its story is decidedly more complicated than the first game, but what it loses in straightforward, simple elegance is made up for in breadth of its personalities, the ambition of its scope and the tone of its message. It’s a tale of differing perspectives, empathy and retribution. It does not shy away from taking bold curveballs with its characters and it punctuates moments of serene beauty with shocking violence and supremely detailed gore. Violence of this ultra-high fidelity is not particularly new to video games in 2020 – look only at Doom Eternal – but it is more unsettling, matter of fact and plain real here than any game I’ve played. You feel the pain you are inflicting, and the game reacts to those horrors with you, its characters succumbing to the toll of sustained trauma.",

            "text": "Taylor Swift drumming up hype for a new record. Politicians trading barbs in the run-up to midterm elections. People debating the merits of The Last of Us. Ah, 2014. How nice to see you again. It’s been a while.\nOf course, the conversation today isn’t about the original Last of Us. It’s about the remake. Naughty Dog’s survival horror hit made plenty of waves when it launched for PlayStation 3 in 2013, and again when it was remastered for PlayStation 4 the following year. (It’s also perhaps most singularly responsible for kickstarting the oft-teased “dad game” subgenre.) Now, the studio is releasing a total from-the-ground-up remake for PlayStation 5. It’s out tomorrow.\nCalled The Last of Us Part I, this remake is meant to bring the 2013 original up to the lofty graphical benchmark set by its 2020 sequel, The Last of Us Part II. Visually, yes, The Last of Us Part I does exactly that. But that’s all it does. This is functionally the same game you played in 2013, and 2014, and, if you owned a PS5 and subscribed to PS Plus, in 2020 too, when the first remaster was released to players at no extra cost as part of the PS Plus Collection. It’s like Skyrim, just without the Thomas the Tank Engine mods.\nIt’s not lost on me that, within a year, we’ll be closer to when The Last of Us takes place than to when it first came out. Set in 2033, the game imagines a version of America beset by a mushroom virus that turns everyone into flesh-eating monsters. (Terrifyingly, the disease is based on a very real fungus.) You play as a gruff bearded dude named Joel, and accompany a 14-year-old girl named Ellie, who may hold the key to unlocking a cure to the virus, on a treacherous, cross-country journey. The story, told over four chapters, is about the growth of their relationship. It’s a road trip, and a bonding adventure, and a redemption story (Joel’s birth daughter is murdered in the prologue, set in 2013), all wrapped in the high-stakes guise of a world-saving mission.\nPlayStation 5 God of War Ragnarök Bundle\nDisc version\nBundle includes PlayStation 5 console, DualSense Wireless Controller, Base, HDMI Cable, AC power cord, USB cable, God of War Ragnarök full game voucher\nThe Last of Us Part I has received glowing praise from across the gameosphere. It’s currently sitting at an impressive 89 on review aggregation site Metacritic, making it not just one of the highest-rated games of the year but also one of the highest-rated games in the PS5 library. You needn’t look far to find critics saying it’s the “best” way to play The Last of Us. On the other hand, though, you’ll find folks wondering why a game that already looked pretty damn good needed the remake treatment at all. (Some have gone so far as to spuriously float the unsubstantiated notion that it exists purely as long-tail marketing for the forthcoming HBO TV adaptation.)\nBased on what I’ve played so far, both sides have some points. The Last of Us Part I is a technologically impressive but ultimately unnecessary remake. I fail to see how widening the wrinkles on Joel’s face significantly improves upon what made the original such an instant classic.\nFor context, at least to those familiar with the game’s plot beats, I’m about four hours in. Last night, I wrapped up the levels set in Boston and made my way into Bill’s second safehouse. I needn’t really play more to know where I stand here. I’ve done this before, like, a dozen times.\nTo be clear, I love this game. I’m squarely among the crowd of folks who consider The Last of Us a permanent fixture of the pantheon, a genuinely transcendent masterpiece. And Part I does build on that in tangible ways. There’s a truly mind-blowing array of accessibility options that weren’t present in the original run, many of which lower the barrier to entry for playing a game that can be mechanically fraught. Naughty Dog also made use of the PS5 controller’s advanced haptics for neat features, like the option to have the controller vibrate in tandem with the cadence of character dialogue. The graphical improvements are evident, as evidenced by Digital Foundry’s thorough assessment.\nYeah yeah, cool cool cool. I’ve still just been playing The Last of Us (2013/2014).\nReally, so much of this is the same exact game, from the clunky shooting to the ridiculously overpowered brick item to the enemies who can stare you in the face but fail to register your presence because you’re technically behind a wall. Ellie can stroll directly into the sightline of an infected and fail to set off its otherwise trip-wired senses, so long as you’ve kept Joel hidden. Naughty Dog even appears to have retained the exact same solutions to all of the optional puzzles—an exceedingly minor nitpick that only serves to reinforce the notion that this is all well-trod ground. (If you’re stumped on finding a code to a hidden safe, you can rest assured that the solution exists on Google somewhere, having been published by a studious guides writer nine years ago.) Coming off the The Last of Us Part II, which is mechanically more in depth than its predecessor in every way, these limitations are put into stark relief.\nPlaying Part I has made me seriously reconsider the art of the re-release: What games deserve a total redux? What’s the benchmark for a remake versus just a slickly produced remaster? I know in my head that, definitionally, a remake is essentially a new game built from scratch or close to it, whereas a remaster is more or less a spruced-up version of an existing game (to put both of those phrases in the broadest possible terms). But does dictionary dot com matter when the only thing you actually have in your hands is the end result?\nTo me, The Last of Us Part I looks like a remake, but it sure as hell does not feel like one. Think: Less Demon’s Souls or Final Fantasy VII Remake, more Halo 2 Anniversary. The first two were built from scratch, and reimagined their source material, to varying degrees. The third was the same vehicle with a shinier coat of paint; prettier, sure, but you could still feel its decade-old bones underneath. The Last of Us Part I is far closer to the latter, except without a handy button that allows you to swap between original visuals and the modernized respray.\nIt is undoubtedly lovely to gawk at the photorealism on display here—to catch the bright light of a high noon sun glinting off the surface of a waterlogged Beacon Street, or to see the world-weary resignation of a partner who knows their time has come. Naughty Dog has long staked its pedigree on hyper-realistic visuals; The Last of Us, in its many incarnations, is included in that oeuvre.\nBut the game is and has never been strictly about winning the fidelity arms race. It’s always been about the narrative: the search for glimmers of hope in a world that has none, and about the lengths to which some people will go to hold onto their piece of the future, everyone else be damned. It’s fraught, and messy, and tough to grapple with, and interesting in a way few games were at the time. In 2013, The Last of Us was already visually stunning enough and, more importantly, human enough to draw players into the inner lives of its complicated characters, to stir a wave of voyeuristic emotion with a subtle expression passing across Ellie’s face. It still works now, but only because it worked back then too.\nThe whole calculus behind Part I is wrapped in the gooey paper of its price sticker. We don’t typically discuss such matters at Kotaku, but I do think Part I merits an exception: It’s among a slew of current-gen games setting the new baseline at $70, up from the previous standard of $60. That’s no small ask for folks who already partake in a relatively expensive hobby. Were I in a similar position as Polygon’s Nicole Carpenter, who had not played the game prior to this year, yes, The Last of Us Part I is unequivocally the manner in which I’d prefer to play it. Coming from the perspective of someone who’s run through this game more than a dozen times, had I paid $70 here, I’ll be honest, I’d probably feel a little burned, like I’d bought a pair of shoes I already owned. (Sony provided Kotaku with a PS5 code for The Last of Us Part I ahead of tomorrow’s release.)\nAnyway, let’s do this all again in ten years, when Naughty Dog releases The Last of Us Part I Remake Remastered Reloaded—y’know, if the IRL clickers haven’t devoured us all by then.",

            "text": "[Note: Contains spoilers for the game]\nThe Last of Us Part 2 was released on June 19, 2020 as a Playstation 4 exclusive after several delays, and yielded mixed reviews from its audience. As I played the game, I understood why with “understood” being said loosely. With the biggest concerns that I initially came across on the internet being that a woman was too muscular, my excitement for the game grew… immensely.\nI really was convinced that when the story started, Joel was going to be dead and Ellie was going to be this cold and angry woman. But the story shows the before and after of Joel’s death, and then sets the main story in motion. It gives a wider breath of context to the world as we’re introduced to it. I was delightfully surprised that the game wasn’t 100% anger, grit, and violence. A lot of it was, obviously, but not the expected entirety. There’s jokes, snowball fights, and a gas mask bong.\nIn terms of the story’s structure, I was a big fan of most creative choices, but one choice in particular left me frustrated. After Abby has a confrontation with Ellie, the story resets to Abby’s story three days to finding Ellie. While playing Abby’s story is great, and playing it uninterrupted was definitely the way to go, it’s frustrating to work so hard to get Ellie to the point of finding Abby, only to have the story reset. Story-wise, it makes sense to see where Abby is coming from and play a new story from her point of view. It also seems logical to have the underlying knowledge of what is about to happen to Abby and her friends, however, that dramatic irony of knowing what is going to happen doesn’t serve as much suspense as it does with “let’s get a move on I want to get to the part of the story I already worked for”. That being said, I loved Abby’s story and I really enjoyed her as a character and her development.\nNow, while I understand the innate need to hate her, I don’t and I didn’t from the start. Frankly, I started to like her once her character was developed and we learned about her past and how she came to be where she is. Depending on the mood during my gameplay, I like Abby more than I like Ellie.\nThe Last of Us Part 2 included LGBTQ main characters, all in ways that weren’t forced. The game ultimately benefited from these additions and widened the world, making clear that while the infected were running around and wreaking havoc, there were still complex and unique worlds and people living their lives. The game may forever hold a place in my heart because of this.\nThe visuals in this game, as expected, are phenomenal. I was thoroughly impressed but also not surprised by this. We knew that this game was going to be beautiful and this fact was one of the biggest strengths that the game flaunted. Another strength that gave the game a new level of awe was how the climax of the game took place during a massive thunderstorm. The storm visuals paired with the thunder + lightning effects were nothing short of stunning. One specific shot of Abby during a cinematic, lit with a flash of lightning, nearly made me heart stop. I was awestruck.\nIn a recent update, several game mods became available, including unlimited ammo and crafting, which is a great way to spice up the game but it also makes for something a little more hysterical; a molotov run. I made it through at least half of Ellie’s portion of the game using only molotovs and the motivation of my friend beside himself with laughter. 10/10 I always recommend finding ridiculous ways to play very serious video games.\nI’m happy to say that The Last of Us Part 2 is an intense, intriguing, emotional, and fun game that anybody who wants to play can find a way to play. That being said, don’t let any young kids play this game. Rated M for Mature after all!\nGameplay Review Notes: I always play games on easy mode the first time around, and usually with several accessibility modes turned on. The Last of Us 2 had a plethora of accessibility options for people who are visually impaired, deaf or hard of hearing, or have trouble with fine motor functions.\nI also played the game with navigation assistance. It’s always been easy for me to get lost or confused with video games that have a really vast setting. I also played with motor and hearing assistance, so it was easier to aim and I had visual cues for when an enemy was about to discover where I was hunkering down. These functions were beyond helpful and made for an appropriately challenging game that I was able to enjoy.",

            "text": "The Real Reason The Last Of Us 2 Is Getting Review Bombed\nThe Last of Us Part 2 director Neil Druckmann knew that the game would be divisive among fans. Now, though, it's being attacked by people who haven't even played it. Less than four days after release, The Last of Us Part 2 has gotten thousands of user ratings on Metacritic, many of which are as low as they can get.\nThe average person has no power to stop a game from being released or stop people from buying it, which is where review bombing comes in. Gamers who object to something about a game, from the platform it's released on to the game's very existence, use the only thing they have: negative user reviews. They hope that by dragging the ratings down as much as possible, they'll get people to think the game isn't worth buying and make it flop.\nFirst of all, some of you may ask why this appears to be deliberate review bombing. It could just be a really bad game, right?\nFor starters, The Last of Us Part 2 has only been out for a few days as of writing this article, and already has nearly 50,000 ratings on Metacritic (note: many of the user reviews contain spoilers, so don't read them if you're still planning to play). That's more than every version of the original The Last of Us combined. A good portion of those ratings came when it had been out for less than a day. Considering the game is supposed to take anywhere from 15-25 hours to finish, it seems pretty unlikely that these are fair and honest reviews. Undoubtedly some people started playing and decided the game wasn't for them, but thousands of 0/10 reviews within a few hours of release? That's more than a bit suspicious.\nSecondly, most critics adore the game. People will be tempted to point to that as an example of critics being out of touch with their audiences or, worse, of \"paid shills.\" However, stack up good reviews almost across the board next to, apparently, near-universal hatred from fans, and it looks a bit fishy.\nThird, as we've mentioned before, The Last of Us Part 2 had a rough time of it even before release. After leaks spoiled some of the game's content, fans of the original got up in arms. There were also other decisions that people felt were \"betrayals\" of the characters, the series, and the fans.\nSo what's caused this huge outpouring of hatred from people who have never played the game and most likely never will?\nPredictably, some of the backlash is due to what some perceive to be Naughty Dog catering to \"SJWs,\" or \"social justice warriors.\" Some — including those who likely reviewed the game before they could have feasibly finished it — accused it of including \"LGBTQ propaganda.\" Others were more specific with their criticisms, though not necessarily accurate. Another user on Metacritic took issue with one character being \"a buff trans girl.\" This character is not that, and is simply a straight woman who works out. But it's easy to imagine this take came from someone who saw the character in a pre-release cutscene and hasn't yet met the character in the game. This HITC article helpfully explains the offensive misunderstanding.\nOther players are upset because of what was revealed by the leaks. The Last of Us fans were given major plot points without any context or buildup. It ended up looking hasty and forced, as if Naughty Dog were going for shock value rather than actually telling a good story.\nFinally, as mentioned before, some of the negative reviews are sure to be from people who played and genuinely didn't like the game. That's especially likely now that it's been out for a few days, for two reasons: first, the initial dogpile of negative reviews has subsided a bit by now. Second, players have actually had enough time with the game to decide whether they like it or not, and why.\nThe Last of Us Part 2 is currently sitting at a 3.9/10 user score on Metacritic, which is actually up a bit from the initial review bomb it suffered. Google's audience rating summary puts it at 2.2/5, with most scores being either a perfect 5 or an abysmal 1. However, a few brave souls who actually read through some of the negative reviews note that those people don't seem to have even played the game (which is, after all, the whole concept of a review bomb).\nIn short, if you're concerned about the low scores that The Last of Us Part 2 is getting from players and questioning whether it's actually worth buying, take a look first and make sure you know why it's getting those scores. If people are genuinely objecting to the gameplay, the storytelling, or something about the game itself, that's worth looking at. If you see tens of thousands of negative reviews from people who, in many cases, haven't even played it, you can probably take those with a grain of salt.",

            "text": "The Last of Us Part I Review: Play It Again, Ellie\nWhen Naughty Dog's The Last of Us debuted nearly a decade ago in 2013 for the PlayStation 3, it received near-universal critical acclaim. Not only did it win players over with its visceral gameplay and narrative, but it ended up becoming one of the best-selling video games of all time. Frequently cited as one of the best video games ever made, it's grown into a media franchise that practically guarantees success, whether that means crowds that gather for a simple remastered version only a year after the original game or a live-action television adaptation on HBO.\nBut as excellent as the original game was, with its remaster adding higher-quality graphics and improved touchups, it paled in comparison to what the PlayStation 4's The Last of Us Part II could ultimately do. The graphical and narrative powerhouse was a massive step up from its predecessor, and felt almost like walking into a completely different world. It became the standard for The Last of Us—but with so many new players jumping on board to see the second installment, the original game needed the same treatment. It needed parity with the new game to bring a sense of cohesion to the project.\nPerhaps that was the thought behind Naughty Dog's decision to take The Last of Us Part I and give it a complete overhaul, less than 10 years after releasing it into the wild. While the remaster did a great job of modernizing the game a bit, the remake reimagines the landscapes, character models and much more from The Last of Us Part I to staggeringly gorgeous effect.\nWhile the core game itself remains largely unchanged, it's safe to say this new version should be considered the definitive way to experience the ballad of Ellie and Joel as they eke out an existence on the periphery of humanity's collapse. This is the way The Last of Us Part I was ultimately meant to be experienced.\nThe Last of Us Part I Review: Story\nWhen it first arrived, The Last of Us Part I was set in the same year it took place: 2013. A mutated Cordyceps fungus has destroyed nearly all of humanity, with human hosts having turned into rabid, zombie-like \"Infected\" cropping up first in the United States and spreading throughout the world. A Texas father and daughter, Joel and Sarah, desperately try to flee the burning city while the Infected wreak havoc. In the end, while Joel and Sarah flee with Joel's brother Tommy, Sarah is caught in the crossfire.\nTwenty years later, humanity has survived—somewhat. Joel has relocated to Boston, working with fellow Survivors and partner Tess to smuggle goods. One of his last assignments finds him pairing up with a member of the Fireflies, a rebel militia who opposes the way things are being run following the Infected taking over the world. The Fireflies task Joel with smuggling a teenage girl named Ellie to another group of Fireflies in exchange for a large cache of stolen weapons. Joel and Tess agree, but soon they learn the truth about Ellie: She's infected.\nThe story unfolds as several truths are revealed about Ellie, the Fireflies and Joel himself, who's been grieving for the past two decades without his wife and daughter. His icy exterior melts slowly as he finds Ellie has quickly become the daughter he lost so many years ago. Like The Walking Dead, the drama focuses more on the characters than the Infected, and it makes for a compelling narrative with enough twists and turns that it feels like watching a Hollywood blockbuster.\nThe Last of Us Part I Review: Gameplay\nJoel and Ellie's trek throughout the Infected-ridden Midwest feels like playing an interactive zombie flick. Much like that feeling of \"I'm playing the movies!\" franchises like Uncharted have brought to prominence over the years (though gaming has done this well for some time), you're right in the center of the action, always.\nThe Last of Us Part I has always been a third-person action game with plenty of shooting to tackle, and whether you use shotguns, pistols, bows or melee, it's always incredibly visceral, especially when dealing with the Cordyceps-riddled Infected. They come in several forms, and they'll lop off Joel's head or have him meet an untimely death in an instant if you let them.\nThere's plenty to use around the environment to take the Infected to task, including pipes, baseball bats, shivs, Molotov cocktails and much more. You can consume edible plants or pills to gain health, and scavenge for crafting materials that can be used at workbenches scattered around the world. All of this was already in place, of course, in the game when it first debuted.\nWhat's changed? Combat is more fluid and responsive than it was before. It's all more akin to The Last of Us Part II's veritable bullet ballet. Whether you're creeping up to a Firefly for a stealth kill or facing off against a Bloater Infected with a wing and a prayer, the remake's changes feel right. And if you've never experienced how the first game felt in comparison to the second, you'll be coming into the original game to get caught up feeling like you're reuniting with an old friend.\nSometimes, you'll switch off and play as Ellie as well, just like most of The Last of Us Part II. Ellie isn't as large or as lumbering as Joel, which makes her an easier target, especially in different terrain. Again, for the many players I suspect will be coming into the game for the first time off the back of the sequel, this will feel familiar, given as you're usually Ellie or Abby in The Last of Us Part II.\nAdditionally, there are a variety of different transitions between one area to the next, more breakable objects for use in combat, and improved A.I. All of that is important to remember if you feel like taking on the new permadeath mode, which means when you get killed one time, that's it. No coming back from that. There's also a speed run mode you can opt for that encourages you to complete the game in as little time as possible, complete with timers. If you love collectibles, there's a slew of goodies to go out and search for here, too.\nThe Last of Us Part I Review: Additional Content\nOddly, The Last of Us Part I remains almost completely in step, from my view, with the original game. That means there isn't really any new content here, but that also means there are a few questions I have about potential content that could have been added in hindsight. When tackling a remake, there are always opportunities to add storylines or scenes that had to be cut in the original product. And while I'm curious as to why Naughty Dog decided to forgo adding new content, I can understand the trepidation and backlash that could come from altering a beloved story—even a tiny bit.\nThere's not much new here to speak of as a result. But what is here is some of the most loving and lavish character makeovers you'll see in a remake. Characters, like Ellie and Tess especially, have been aged up a bit, with more believable models. Joel has a much more hardened look to him that can be attributed to 20 years of hard living. But more interestingly, the environments and familiar spaces you may remember from the original have blossomed into more detailed, living, breathing expanses with additional trees, new buildings, pastel skies and arresting green lands. Humanity may be on the brink of extinction, but the world is still beautiful.\nIn addition to the main game, you'll also get The Last of Us Part I: Left Behind DLC, which was previously paid content you'd need to purchase separately. It's also been remade in the same way as the core story itself, and it's a great addition to the package. There's also a slew of accessibility options, which make this version of the game to recommend to just about anyone, whether players want to tone down the gore or have larger subtitles. Though there's a dearth of new content, the availability of this wide variety of settings cannot be understated—and this may be the only real way some players can engage with The Last of Us Part I in a way that's comfortable with them, which is a huge win for accessibility efforts.\nThe Last of Us Part I: Verdict\nThe Last of Us Part I doesn't change things up in terms of the main storyline, and it doesn't reinvent the wheel. It does, however, update a modern classic in ways that new players and veterans alike can agree is absolutely spectacular. Still, with all that in mind, the gorgeous graphics, improved gameplay and smaller extras may not be enough to convince some players to pay the $70 price tag to experience this game again. Judging the game on its own merits, however, for those who are looking to experience The Last of Us Part I for the first time, this is absolutely the best way to do it.\nScore: 9/10\nThe Last of Us Part I will release on September 2, 2022, on PlayStation 5.",

The Jakarta flashback\nIn a similar fashion to episode 1, the show used the cold open to delve a little deeper into the origins and backstory of the pandemic.\nIn 2003, we watch as mycologist Ibu Ratna (Christine Hakim), Indonesia’s number one expert in fungi, discovers the horrifying truth about what is unfolding with the infection.\nThe series sprinkles in some little details about the cause of the outbreak and its spread through a factory producing baking flour – suddenly the cookies from episode 1 and Joel’s throwaway comment about being on the Atkins diet take on a different meaning.\nIt also captures the worldwide scale and impossibility of preventing the apocalyptic events as Ibu reveals the only solution to containing the spread is horrific and almost unthinkable – bombs.\nHer words foreshadow the rest of the episode where Joel, Ellie and Tess begin to make their way through the bombed wreckage of Boston. They also help flesh out the complete lack of hope Joel has in these early episodes. When the only answer from scientists is to bomb your own people, hope is going to be in thin supply.\n2. Farewell Anna Torv\nPedro Pascal and Bella Ramsey will inevitably get the limelight and attention when The Last of Us concludes, but shouldn't let Anna Torv’s performance as Tess go unforgotten.\nWe didn't get long with her, but she managed to create a battle-hardened character, who still managed to retain a sense of hope and soul.\nIn the official HBO podcast, creators Craig Mazin and Neil Druckmann reveal that they fleshed out a full backstory for Tess where she had a husband and kid who got infected. In their backstory, Tess was able to shoot her husband, but not her child – instead locking him in their basement.\nTalking about Tess's response to Ellie, the creators suggest that she is reverting to \"mother mode\" and point out that her bravery in this episode is to \"dare to hope\".\n3. Oh god. The Clickers\nIf you managed to get through episode 1 and thought, 'Oh The Last of Us wasn't that scary', episode 2 wants to come and have a word.\nThe arrival of the much-anticipated Clickers delivered some truly horrific jump-scares, but more importantly managed to capture that same sense of dread and chill as Joel, Tess and Ellie crept their way around the fungi-filled museum.\nBeautifully choreographed to match up with the gameplay, the Clickers didn't disappoint. Those echoing sound effects will give us nightmares for weeks.\n4. Seriously, oh my god - That kiss\nIn a clever bit of symmetry with the opening scenes in Jakarta where the scientists were probing the corpse's mouth, Anna Torv bowed out with the most disgusting and disturbing kiss sequence that has ever aired on TV.\nGross, disturbing, nightmare-inducing – Tess's smooch with an infected had us reaching for the sick bucket. In a smart bit of filming, the whole sequence was shot in the traditional way you would film a romantic clinch, zooming in for the tender close-up.\nIt can only be a matter of time before someone starts sharing versions of the scene with romantic music dubbed over the top.\n5. Why the The Last of Us actors were told not to play the game\nThe show's creators have spoken frequently about the fact they asked all the main cast to avoid playing The Last of Us game if possible.\nCraig Mazin and Neil Druckmann said that everything the cast needed to know was \"on the page\" and wanted the performances to come \"from the inside out\", rather than mimicry.\nSpeaking on the show’s official podcast, the duo cited Pedro Pascal's performance as Joel discovers Tess has been biten as an example of why they operated in this way.\n\"People asked 'why did you tell the actors not to play the game?'. And it’s for moments like this. This moment isn't in the game,\" they said.\n\"The really good screen actors have an incredible sense of where they are in the frame and how close the camera is and how subtle they need to be. Because the littlest things will get picked up.\n\"There is a moment near the end of this episode where Tess reveals she’s infected and he says 'show me'. She steps forward and he flinches.\"\nThe duo said that they loved this acting from Pascal, because it dented the heroism of the character and showed his vulnerability.\nStream The Last of Us weekly on Sky Atlantic with NOW\nMore on The Last of Us\nEpisode 9 recap: Season 1 ending explained, giraffes and Joel's big lie\nNo surprise as HBO gives The Last of Us season 2 the green light\nThe Last of Us: All you need to know about the video game adaptation\nTrivia: Casting criticism and video game bans - 16 facts about The Last of Us\nAll about Ellie: Bella Ramsey's best TV shows and movies in spotlight\nEssential TV for 2023: 75 new and returning shows to watch this year\nImage credit: © 2023 Home Box Office, Inc.

            "text": "The Clickers\nEpisode 2 of The Last Of Us starts in Indonesia 2003. Authorities show up and take a woman away. This is Ibu Ratna, a Professor in Mycology who happens to be working at the nearby University. They need her help to try and combat what’s happening with the infection. She’s brought to the lab and shown a specimen of the cordyceps.\nSpecifically, this happens to be an infected human, who has been bitten on her left leg. Ibu is convinced they can’t survive, but we know they can. If you’ll remember, this show is not using the same cause of infection with the spores as the games. Ibu examines the woman and notices tendrils in her mouth, the same that we saw from the infected in episode 1.\nIbu is shocked to learn that “Patient Zero” (the first person to spread the infection by biting) is still out there, but Ibu has been brought in to try and try and find a vaccine and cure what’s occurring. “There is no vaccine.” She says chillingly. Instead, she suggests they start bombing the city, with everyone still inside.\nMeanwhile, Ellie wakes up with sunlight beaming down on her. She’s inside a building with Joel and Tess both eyeing her suspiciously. She brings up her tests and how Marlene locked her up, checking to see if she gets infected every day with her counting.\nAs for Joel, his wrist is broken with a hairline fracture but he shrugs it off, claiming it’ll heal soon. In fact, he wants to take Ellie back and find another way to get the car battery, but Tess talks him into continuing.\nTess tries to get more details out of Ellie, demanding to know her importance. Ellie rolls her eyes and eventually points out there’s a Firefly base camp out West where they’re working on a cure. Joel again decides they need to head back but Tess, again, convinces him to continue.\nAs they venture out, we learn most of the big cities were bombed in the wake of this infection. The State House is about 10 minutes away but it’s a precarious trip. Joel is at the back while Ellie and Tess talk. Ellie points out she was 14 when she was infected, and reveals that she’s grown up an orphan. There aren’t swarms of infected roaming the streets, but that’s not to say there aren’t worse things out there.\nAn ominous scream from the distance confirms as much, as the group press on through a flooded hotel. Ellie replicates a few of her jokes from the game but given they come with ringing the bell loudly (and there are inevitably infected around) it’s not a smart move. Anyway, thy make it up 10 floors and miraculously, the gang are completely dry. Now, that’s game accurate!\nEventually, Ellie and Joel talk but they barely say two words to one another without it turning into scathing retorts to one another. Ellie mentions the guard he beat to death on the subject of regretful deaths but before Joel can reply, Tess returns. Having secured them a route through the building, they press on and find all the infected together, down on the streets and spilling out a nearby building. Tess points out that the Cordyceps is all connected and stepping on a piece in one area can bring in others from a different area. This is a great bit of foreshadowing, as we’ll see from the moments ahead!\nWith the “long way round” a no-go, the only solution is to go directly through the museum (the “short cut”) although the place looks to be overgrown by fungus. Outside though its all bone-dry so the trio decide to press on and continue through the building.\nUnfortunately, they run into bigger problems when a clicker shows up. The sound design here is fantastic, especially as this creature shambles into the room… and is joined by another. Joel tells them all not to make a sound… so Ellie does and it causes Joel to fight one off. There are some genuinely tense scenes here, as Joel and Ellie try to survive. It’s Joel who manages to get the killer blow on both foes and they come away with Ellie scratched and Tess sporting a twisted ankle. Now, this is why they should have crafted some shivs!\nAfter the clicker encounter, the group head up to the roof. Tess has twisted her ankle, so Joel helps her out. Tess bemoans Joel’s negative attitude and encourages him to go and see Ellie instead. The scene is perfectly worked from the game, with Joel and Ellie looking at the State House in the distance. It’s a brief moment, before they continue on.\nThe group make it to the State House, where Joel goes forward and investigates. Blood spatters – fresh ones – indicate someone is inside the building. Tess goes ahead with Ellie where they find several deceased on the floor. Joel takes up the rear and observes the damage. It doesn’t look like FEDRA are involved (unlike in the games) and all the Fireflies have been killed after being infected.\nTess decides to stay, pointing out that she’s infected. Now, instead of the guards banging at the door and Tess’ sacrifice being one to save the group, gut-wrenching because of the lack of time they have, instead we get a much slower-paced goodbye.\nTess convinces Joel to press on and go to Bill and Frank’s place. “You keep her alive and you set everything right,” Tess says, showing Joel Ellie’s healed arm. When one of the infected moves on the ground, Joel shoots it in the head. The tendrils move, as it seems the Infected have been roused and are coming.\nTess decides to try and buy them some time, making sure the infected don’t follow by pouring oil all over the floor, followed by a handful of grenades. “Save who you can save.” She says, as Ellie and Joel take off together.\nTess struggles to get her lighter to work as floods of then infected pour into the building. I mean, she could just shoot a grenade on the floor right? Anyway, she eventually manages to get her lighter to work, but only after one of the infected assaults and kisses her with its tendrils sticking in her mouth.\nThe whole place erupts into a brilliant explosion, as Joel and Ellie manage to get out without a single infected following and press on to their next destination.\nThe Episode Review\nThe second episode of The Last Of Us changes big parts of the game’s story and while some parts are quite intriguing (like the beginning in Indonesia) other parts are not. Before we dive into that though, it’s worth pointing out the excellent parts of this chapter.\nThe whole encounter with the Clickers was absolutely pitch perfect, with the sound design throughout being absolutely fantastic. The changed lore with the infected, showing off the tendrils that are all connected, is a nice touch too, but it also negates Tess and Ellie’s bit of dialogue where they discuss the infected giving off fungal spores when killed.\nThe production design looks great and some of the moments ripped from the games – like Ellie pretending to be a customer at the hotel or those moments on the roof – give off the most authentic version of this young girl. Unfortunately, everything else leaves a lot to be desired.\nA big part of the game’s allure comes from the developing relationship between Joel and Ellie over time. They go from strangers who dislike one another to essentially a father/daughter tie, with some great moments along the way. The TV show though disrupts that slightly with the bizarre flashback at the end of episode 1, and then takes 26 minutes before Joel and Ellie even say anything to one another.\nIn fact, all those sequences with Ellie and Tess talking to one another would have worked so much better if Tess and Joel switched places, allowing Joel to learn more information about this young girl. The relationship between the pair could still become something special in the future, but right now the ties between them aren’t anywhere near as good as it was in the games.\nHowever, there’s enough to like here to stick with for the long-haul.

            "text": "The Last of Us Episode 2, titled “Infected”, is a great example of worldbuilding – and building tension. It picks up in the aftermath of “When You’re Lost in the Darkness,” as Joel Miller (Pedro Pascal) continues to escort Ellie (Bella Ramsey) across the wreckage of Boston with his partner Tess (Anna Torv). It’s not an easy trip: Ellie has been infected by the Cordyceps virus, and Joel is fearful that she’ll turn on them. To make matters worse, there are new forms of infected lurking in the dark.\nWhat I love about The Last of Us so far is that it takes time to showcase the events that led to the world’s downfall. This is especially true of The Last of Us Episode 2 as it once again opens on a 2003-era scene, this time set in Jakarta. This scene helps showcase just how far-reaching and horrifying the effects of the Cordyceps are.\nWhen a scientist is asked about possible courses of action, she offers a simple one: “Bomb the city.” That single sentence is just as chilling as any Cordyceps-infected being because it reveals that even with such extreme measures, mankind wasn’t prepared for the virus. Compared to most post-apocalyptic media, which mostly focuses on the aftereffects of a collapsed society or confines the action to the United States, The Last of Us is slowly building out its world – which helps separate it from the game it’s based on but also adds even more layers to said game.\nWhen it comes to the present-day sequences, Pascal and Ramsey continue to captivate me with their performances. Pascal, in particular, says so much with so little. His hands shake as he picks up a gun, and his eyes have years’ worth of pain pulsing behind them. Not many people can give off a whole history with just their body movement alone, but Pascal is definitely up to the challenge. Alternatively, Ramsey offers some levity throughout the episode. Even if it’s the end of the world, Ellie is a teenage girl, and she seems more than done with Joel’s surly attitude. But the episode’s MVP is Torv as Tess. In comparison to Pascal’s brooding near silence, Torv is more open and determined in her character’s mission. This builds up to the episode’s final scene, which will shatter many hearts but also packs a wealth of emotion into so many minutes.\nShowrunners Neil Druckmann and Craig Mazin switch duties for this episode, with Druckmann directing and Mazin writing. Mazin’s script has the pacing down to a T; entire scenes are dedicated to showcasing the ruins of Boston and just what happens when the Cordyceps take hold of a victim. And for a first-time director, Druckmann surprisingly knows how to stage tension. A moment where Joel, Ellie, and Tess have to navigate the ruins of a museum and avoid the infected had me on the edge of my seat. I didn’t know what was around the corner or what was going to happen next. And that’s how I like my horror.\nAnd finally, the infected themselves will sear themselves into your deepest nightmares. In keeping with the fungi theme, some of the infected have heads that are more or less giant mushrooms. And their limbs twist and jerk with horrifying speed; these are the type of undead that you can’t outrun. And a large part of that is due to the use of practical effects, which are simply outstanding. The Cordyceps looks like it’s actually growing out of people’s heads, which is equal parts impressive and frightening.\nBut what makes the “mushroom heads” scary is their ability to sense sounds. Whether it’s something as loud as a gunshot or even the crackling of dried fungi, any sound will instantly draw them into the orbit of their victims. This means Joel, Ellie, and Tess have to walk in absolute silence. Druckmann truly shines as a director with these scenes; his camera follows the protagonists as they move through the shadows, and pulls in on their terror-stricken faces as the mushroom heads twitch and jerk ever so close to them. At times the only sound in the room is that of panicked breath.\nThe Last of Us Episode 2 never lets up for a minute, building up tension and showcasing the horror of a post-Cordyceps world. This series is building on everything that made the video games great while also finding ways to push the story in new directions. If you ask me, that’s what any good adaptation should do.\nThe Last of Us is available now on HBO Max with new episodes premiering every Sunday.\nThe Last of Us Episode 2\n- Rating - 8.5/108.5/10\nTL;DR\nThe Last of Us Episode 2 never lets up for a minute, building up tension and showcasing the horror of a post-Cordyceps world.
