            "text": "Well, we know where the budget for The Mandalorian’s third season went. It appears a good chunk of it was saved for the finale, which was a step up in quality across the board, but especially in terms of choreography during the epic fight scenes. While much of this season’s action felt cheap and stilted, ‘The Return’ had a bunch of really epic, awesome confrontations between Mando, the Mandalorians and Moff Gideon’s forces. Din Djarin finally remembered he was a badass warrior—it just took him all season to get back to the character fans fell in love with in the beginning.\nThis is the puzzling and frustrating thing about The Mandalorian’s Season 3 finale. In so many ways I really loved it, but it’s held back from greatness by the really, deeply lackluster season that preceded it.\nA few of the things that I disliked about Season 3:\n- Mando was basically incompetent the entire season. None of the badass fighting skills that we’ve seen in past seasons (including The Book Of Boba Fett) made an appearance and then—all of a sudden—he was taking down bad guys like John Wick in the season finale.\n- The Mandalorians were similarly presented as fairly incompetent, especially on their new, monster-filled planet where they just let dragons make off with their kids and kept running out of jetpack fuel.\n- Fight choreography has been awful. Even the final scene in Episode 7 where Paz Vizsla was killed featured a bunch of bad guys just standing there firing. Nobody taking cover, or hovering in the air, or even just kneeling to make it look cool.\n- Too much filler. Having weird bottle episodes like Episode 3 with the clone scientist or Episode 6 with the Scooby Doo stuff and the cameos just felt so tonally bizarre. It’s one thing to have a side-quest with Mando hunting down a bounty and being a badass, but Lizzo? And did we really need an entire episode to establish that Elia Kane was a spy for the Empire?\n- The quality was all over the place. Really weird dialogue, stilted deliveries from a lot of the actors, some bizarre prop and costume choices, sloppy editing—if you go back and watch Season 1, you’ll see just how much more consistent the quality was.\n- I like Bo-Katan but I admit, I really do miss some of the older cast members like Cara Dune and Migs Mayfeld.\nIn any case, this episode wrapped up a lot in a short, 38-minute runtime. We get the epic battle between the Mandalorians and Gideon’s forces, which was awesome. Axe Woves pulls a very similar maneuver to Holdo in The Last Jedi but it actually made sense, was even more badass and he managed to do it while A) staying alive himself and B) not acting like a complete jerk about everything.\nWhile Mando got the majority of awesome fight scenes, Grogu had his own moments, helping fight off the Praetorian guard and then using the Force to save Bo-Katan, himself and Din Djarin from the explosion. This was a direct call-back to him saving them from the fire-troopers in Season 1, but this time the conflagration was much bigger and he didn’t pass out immediately afterward. Just plopped down onto his butt. He is growing in The Force, clearly.\nI did like that it took teamwork to bring down Gideon, whose Beskar suit is honestly one of the coolest in all of Star Wars. Not as iconic as Vader’s, but in many ways I think it’s actually a lot slicker and more practical. I’m less sure how to feel about him just crushing the Darksaber like it was a twig. Kind of an odd end to the fabled blade, though perhaps fitting. I’m still making up my mind about that.\nIs Gideon dead? That’s less certain. Is anyone ever truly dead in Star Wars? We saw him get caught by the flames, but he was in his armor and we never saw a body. That’s either an important detail or it isn’t. We shall see in Season 4.\nSpeaking of Season 4, I almost wish there wasn’t one. In the end, Mando adopts Grogu so that he can become a Mandalorian apprentice. The new dad then goes and gets a good job, working as a cleaner for the New Republic hunting down Imperials. Then he gets a nice new house and the episode wraps up on him sitting on his porch, watching his kid play in the yard. There’s even a Looney Tunes-style circle that closes in on the sweet moment that makes it feel even more like the end of the entire series, not just the season.\nBut while the show hasn’t been officially renewed, we do know that creators Jon Favreau and Dave Filoni have already been working on the scripts and want to keep making the show as long as possible. I sincerely doubt that Disney has any plans to cancel one of their biggest hits.\nStill, it felt like a reset. The end of an arc. Maybe Season 4 will just be a series of one-off adventures with Din Grogu and Din Djarin hunting down Imperials and other bounties, with all the epic Mandalore and Moff Gideon stuff shoved aside. I’d be okay with that.\nThree other important points:\n- There were no spies. After last week’s episode, everyone started theorizing that either Axe or the Armorer or maybe the new Mandalorians they meet on the planet would be double agents working for Gideon. If that’s the case, none of them were revealed in the finale.\n- Mando didn’t die! I was getting worried last week that this was their plan and that he’d die and Bo-Katan or Grogu would become the titular Mandalorian going forward, but he survived and is off living the dream on Navarro with his kid.\n- No post-credits scene! This was a surprise. I really thought we’d get a glimpse of Thrawn, or maybe just Moff Gideon rising from the ashes. Something. In some ways, the lack of a post-credits scene makes this feel even more like a series finale.\nAll told, a very enjoyable season finale but one that comes after so much fluff and subpar material that it feels a bit like a letdown in spite of itself. Season 3 was a wasted opportunity to do a lot more, but it spun its wheels for most of the season and only really got to the good stuff in the final two episodes.\nNext up: Ahsoka in August and Star Wars Jedi: Survivor—the new video game sequel to Fallen Order—next week. Hopefully both will be really great.\nWhat did you think of the Season 3 finale? Let me know on Twitter or Facebook.",

            "text": "The Mandalorian season 3 finale review: What we've been waiting for\nEpisode 8 will be divisive, but brings us back to the heart of the show.\nWarning: This article contains spoilers for The Mandalorian season 3 finale.\nAnd with that, The Mandalorian season 3 is over. Following in the footsteps of the whole season, episode 8 is sure to be divisive to fans – but for some of us, it's what we've been waiting for.\nSeason 3 has largely lacked the structure that brought seasons 1 and 2 together so nicely. At times, we've been dawdling, with Jon Favreau's admission that he doesn't know how the show is going to ultimately end certainly not helping matters.\nBut, while some will argue that the finale to season 3 was too safe, it was a satisfying end to a rocky season. It brought (some) threads together nicely, with a villain return that didn't rely on fan service.\nWe saw our heroes at their best: Din Djarin (Pedro Pascal) fighting Moff Gideon (Giancarlo Esposito) and his clones in a tense battle, Bo-Katan (Katee Sackhoff) being as badass as ever, and Grogu at his most powerful using the force – and finally becoming a Mandalorian.\nWhile many may have been expecting it, a shock appearance from a new character was never the way to go for the season 3 finale. It worked well in season 2 and made complete sense for the story, but any more random cameos in season 3 could have come across as lazy.\nAlthough some threads have still not really been tied up (we would have liked to see more from Dr Pershing after episode 3's refreshing new story), episode 8 feels like a return to form that we've been missing throughout the whole season.\nWhere do we go from here, then? It seems likely that there will be less of a focus on Mando and Grogu. While we're sure we'll see some of their adventures for the New Republic, we'll flit back and forth between them and Mandalore. At this point, it does seem like we need a change, with some fans getting a little bored of the premise 24 episodes in.\nRegardless, wasn't it a nice change to have a happy ending? Maybe that's letting the show off too easily but, at the heart of it, Mando and Grogu's bond was where we started and a great way to see out their story for now.\nThe Mandalorian season 3 finale recap\nEpisode 8 kicked off at the heart of the action, with the Mandalorians fighting the returning Moff Gideon.\nDespite fears that Djarin could die this episode, he expertly wards off his captors with some help from Grogu in the IG-12 suit. Djarin decides that Gideon needs to be dealt with once and for all, while Gideon decides to fight Djarin himself.\nMore like this\nR5 helps Djarin with his plot, hacking into the schematics and gaining control of the shields, while Djarin and Grogu head to the Command Center, where they expect Gideon to be. However, they only find Gideon's clones, making it clear why he was so interested in Dr Pershing's research. However, the clones are short-lived, with Djarin flooding the room.\nBo-Katan leads her troops to safety in the surface caves, before urging them: \"Let's take back our planet.\"\nDjarin and Grogu finally find Gideon (well, he finds them), and he's not too happy. It seems he had high hopes for his clones – hopes that have been dashed by Djarin.\n\"My clones were finally going to be perfect,” he explains. “The best parts of me, but improved by adding the one thing I never had: The Force. I was isolating the potential to wield The Force, and incorporating it into an unstoppable army. And you smothered them before they could take their first breath.”\nHe sets the Praetorian Guards on Grogu while fighting Djarin himself, and Bo-Katan rocks up in the nick of time. Bo-Katan fights Gideon with the Darksaber, before he manages to crush the age-old weapon in the palm of his hand.\nBy entering your details, you are agreeing to our terms and conditions and privacy policy. You can unsubscribe at any time.\nAt this point, the world is quite literally falling apart around our heroes and, while Grogu manages to protect them with The Force, the flames engulf Gideon, making it rather unlikely that he'll survive a second time (although never say never! We're not convinced we've seen the last of those clones).\nCut to little Ragnar (remember him? Paz Viszla's son, who almost got killed by a giant bird), saying the Creed, as we come full circle to revisit the beginning of the season.\nDjarin argues that, although he can't speak the Creed, Grogu should become his apprentice. In order to give permission, he adopts him as his own.\nThe final scenes of the season show Djarin reuniting with Greef Karga (Carl Weathers) to tell him that he'll now be taking on select missions for the New Republic. He also reveals that he was able to find the missing parts to bring back IG-11, who will now be Marshal of Nevarro.\nWe end with Djarin watching over Grogu as he practices using The Force, with the pair seemingly at peace – for now.\nThe Mandalorian is available to stream on Disney Plus.

            "text": "In the business world, there’s a concept called scope creep. Unlike a lot of corporate jargon, scope creep means more or less what it says: It’s what happens when the scope of a given project slowly expands as it’s being worked on, eventually causing a problem where everyone involved is trying to solve too many problems at once, and the project’s initial goals begin to suffer. It’s a failure of planning — don’t articulate a goal clearly enough and you essentially invite sprawl, a bunch of unsatisfying answers to just as many vague questions, instead of a clear solution for something you need solved.\nThe Mandalorian has a scope creep problem. This is ironic, given how the series arrived seemingly fully formed: a spare, samurai-Western take on Star Wars that cribbed on Lone Wolf and Cub, following the Mandalorian Din Djarin and his young Yoda-like ward Grogu through the Galaxy’s scrappier side. But in its second season and beyond, The Mandalorian increasingly became a vehicle for clarifying Star Wars lore, ultimately leading to a frustrating third season that put its characters second in favor of untangling the spotty fictional history of Mandalore and its people, as they were presented in The Clone Wars and Rebels.\nThis, in and of itself, isn’t the problem. Calling a show The Mandalorian isn’t a promise to only be about the same Mandalorian, and in fact it invites questions about other Mandalorians and what became of them. The show doesn’t have to answer those questions, but creator Jon Favreau and Star Wars lore wonk Dave Filoni have decided that it will. That decision makes sense, even if the answers they deliver are a bit odd or divisive.\nConsiderable effort has been spent in season 3 expounding on the differences between Din Djarin’s cult-like covert of Mandalorians and the less religious sect that Bo-Katan (Katee Sackhoff) hails from, as well as the myth and history surrounding the final days of their once-great homeworld of Mandalore. Very little of this has been mined for drama — the goal here is clarification and consolidation, bringing all the Mandalorians under one roof.\nThis is already a pretty big task, one that is arguably too much for the limited amount of time The Mandalorian has in its far-too-brief seasons. Things only get worse when that same logic is applied to The Mandalorian’s place in the Star Wars timeline, and what happens when the show’s writers decide — as they have in season 3 episodes like “The Convert” — to use the show as a vehicle to tie together the discordant ideas present in the canon.\nThe Mandalorian is the only major and ongoing work set in what’s called the New Republic era, the roughly 30-year gap in time between the Rebellion’s victory over the Empire in Return of the Jedi and the rise of the First Order and the events of The Force Awakens. Lucasfilm’s new Star Wars canon has been cagey about this gap in time — a few comics, like The Rise of Kylo Ren, and books, like Claudia Gray’s Bloodline, have been set in this era, but nothing has really explored it with the depth of the Legends books and comics that came in the wake of Timothy Zahn’s Heir to the Empire.\nThis could have been a boon to The Mandalorian, giving it a clean slate to show off a Star Wars that was familiar but different. Instead it chose a lot of the same: desert planets and Boba Fett. Fair enough! In 2019, when the series premiered, the sequel trilogy had not yet come to a close with The Rise of Skywalker, and Mando’s gritty old-school approach was a good contrast to the bombastic sequel trilogy. Now, however, The Mandalorian is effectively a cornerstone of modern Star Wars, and in bringing back the villain Moff Gideon (Giancarlo Esposito), The Mandalorian has also been tasked with showing the origins of the First Order, and how this grand New Republic we saw Han, Luke, Leia, and Chewbacca fight for was effectively screwed from the start.\nOn paper, these are not bad ideas, but The Mandalorian has been a poor vehicle for delivering them. What should have been a nimble ship is now dragging tons of continuity baggage behind it, forced to explain Mandalore, Mandalorians, and the political fortunes of the New Republic across eight measly episodes that don’t even like to tell you what they’re about until 10 minutes have elapsed in the first place. The show’s cast of characters is small and thin, its vectors for storytelling are precious few. Its pleasures are mostly in Grogu slapstick and Wookieepedia updates; it does not allow itself the time to give its few character arcs the weight they deserve, like Bo-Katan’s ascension to leader of Mandalore.\nUltimately, this results in a show that leaves the viewer feeling adrift. What is it about? Who should we root for? What do we want to see next? The Mandalorian is gesturing in a half dozen directions, but its heart isn’t in any of them. If Din and Grogu’s relationship is the heart of the show, it’s become strangely ancillary — especially since the massive decision to have Grogu leave the path of a Jedi behind to be with Din happened in The Book of Boba Fett, an entirely different show.\nThis is what scope creep looks like: a man in cool armor and his adorable little ward floating beside him, constantly forced to pause their journey through the galaxy because someone keeps making them pull over to use the bathroom and edit the wiki every 30 minutes.",

            "text": "By all accounts, that was not the series finale of The Mandalorian. Oh sure, it wrapped up (almost) every ongoing storyline, the big villain was (apparently) vanquished, and the last shot was almost as definitively “This Is The End” as Indiana Jones literally riding into the sunset at the end of The Last Crusade (though that was also not The End, so maybe that’s an even more apt comparison than I thought), but no. Jon Favreau has already confirmed that a fourth season of The Mandalorian will happen, and we have Dave Filoni’s crossover movie coming at some point as well. So no, this is not the last we’ll see of Din Djarin and the newly christened Din Grogu, but…I wouldn’t be too upset if it were.\nYou can see the trajectory that all of the characters are on after this point. You know who’s going to do what next. The only lingering mysteries left are way in the past and won’t really impact the present day anyway. I’d be happy to see more, but I don’t really need to, so hopefully Filoni and Favreau know what they’re doing with Ahsoka and their other upcoming projects.\nBut as for this episode, it kicks off immediately after the events of last week, with Din Djarin getting captured by Moff Gideon’s new Mandalorian-style soldiers and Bo-Katan retreating with the other Mandalorians. Din easily escapes his captors with a pretty brutal fight scene that involves him stabbing one in the stomach and snapping the other’s neck (reminder that these are definitely people and not droids, unlike last season’s Dark Troopers), and then Grogu shows up in his IG-12 mech suit for backup. Meanwhile, Bo sends Axe Woves ahead to warn the fleet that Gideon’s TIE Fighters are coming, telling him to abandon their flagship as a decoy and just bring everyone to the planet’s surface, and he uses his jetpack to fly into space (wild!).\nA superior shooter for less\nImagine shooting smooth, high-resolution QFHD 4K 24p/30p videos and crisp FHD at 60p, all with the convenience and ease of a compact camera. What sets the G100 apart, aside from its great picture, is its user-friendly features. Plus, it’s super compact and lightweight even with a lens attached.\nBack on Mandalore, Din and Grogu try to track down Gideon, reasoning that if they let him live he’ll just keep doing evil stuff. They call up R5-D4 and ask him to hack into the base’s computer and find Gideon’s lair, setting up a bunch of cute astromech shenanigans, like R5 peering over the edge of a bottomless chasm and getting scared, or R5 getting harassed by a herd of Imperial Mouse Droids. Give this guy a spin-off, Filoni! Call it Bad Motivator!\nDin eventually gets to the laser-walled hallway that we saw last week, and while the nods to The Phantom Menace are obvious, it was a pretty neat gimmick for a fight scene. Each section of the hallway was blocked by the walls, so Din would fight two guards at each one, loot their weapons, and then move on to the next section and its slightly better-equipped guards. It was very video game, in a good way. Din constantly losing his weapons was also a nice thread in the early part of this episode, and I loved the quick little shot of him stabbing a trooper in the throat and then desperately trying to pull the knife out before the guy fell down a pit.\nNext is Gideon’s room of clone pods, all of which obviously contain clones of him (one dramatically opens its eyes when Grogu gets close!), and Din hits the “destroy all clones” button on a nearby computer console to blow up the pods. Gideon is pissed that he labeled that button so clearly, and when Din and Grogu find him in the next room, he—once again—lays out his evil plan: He wanted to clone himself, but make it so the clones could use the Force! Yeah guy, we know. We’ve been watching the show.\nDin and Gideon fight, Gideon calls in the Praetorian Guards and gets the upper hand, Grogo runs in hammering his “No” button, and the guards decide to go kill him instead in another room, leaving him and Din separated. The Guards shred the IG-12 mech suit (R.I.P.), and Grogu uses his Force jumps to dart around the room like the little scamp he is.\nMeanwhile, the other Mandalorians have escaped to the surface, with Axe Woves staying behind to control their ship as it gets blown apart by TIEs. The Mandalorian survivors who had been living on Mandalore show Bo and her people an underground cave full of plant life, revealing that they’ve been able to grow farms on the planet—something Bo had never seen, even before the Imperial Purge destroyed their civilization.\nThe Mandalorians rally and go back to Gideon’s base, with everyone zipping around on jetpacks. Ideally, this could’ve been like the perfect blend of a spaceship battle and a boots-on-the-ground shootout, but there are so many jetpack people on both sides that it was hard to really track a ton of the action. Back on the ground, though, Bo sees that Din is in trouble and drops in to help him, sending him to go rescue Grogu, who is about to be killed by the Guards. Din comes in at the last second, and together they’re able to kill the bad guys thanks to Grogu’s use of the Force.\nAt the same time, Gideon is about to beat Bo-Katan and uses the superior strength of his Dark Trooper suit to crush her hand and destroy the Darksaber. He quips that Mandalorians aren’t so tough when you take away their toys, but Bo reminds him of one of the themes of his season: “Mandalorians are stronger together.” Din rushes in and shoots him just as Axe arrives in the crashing Star Destroyer. He tells everybody he’s going to ram it into the base and blow it up, but Bo and Din and Grogu don’t have time to escape. Gideon screams and angrily throws his hands in the air as he’s consumed by the explosion, and our three heroes all die.\nNo, just kidding! Grogu uses the force to shield them all in a bubble like Groot in the first Guardians Of The Galaxy, and the strain of it tuckers the little guy out so much that he has to take an adorable sit when he’s done. Little guy needs a nap! Let him nap, Dave Filoni! God damn!\nAnd that’s it! Good guys win! The rest of the episode is all post-adventure wrap-up, with the Mandalorians relighting the Great Forge at the heart of their planet (Axe Woves is there, somehow surviving the crash) and The Armorer welcoming Paz’s son Ragnar into the Creed by bathing him in the Living Waters beneath the Civic Center. Din shows up and asks her to make Grogu his apprentice, rather than just a baby foundling, and she says no because Grogu can’t speak and therefore can’t take the necessary oath. Din says that doesn’t matter if Grogu’s parents speak for him and announces that he’s going to formally adopt Grogu as his son. Like with Gideon’s speech, was this not already established? People, including Bo-Katan, have been referring to Grogu as Din’s kid for a long time now, so it was odd that the show treated like this a huge moment.\nEither way, The Armorer agrees and rechristens Grogu as Din Grogu and names him Din Djarin’s official apprentice. But, she notes, that means they now have to leave Mandalore and go on more galaxy-spanning adventures, maybe once-a-week for eight weeks, meeting fascinating and unusual characters along the way who are played by surprising guest stars. It’s basically the in-universe version of “here’s some money, go see a Star War,” and I love the directness of it. She literally just sends them off to have serialized adventures somewhere else. The perfect ending for this show.\nBut it keeps going, Return Of The King-style, to make sure there are as many endings as possible. Din and Grogu track down Teva at the beachy New Republic base and tell him about their new “go have adventures” mission, and Din offers up his skills as a bounty hunter to the New Republic so he can help them clear out any other Imperial remnants hanging around. Grogu spots the head of an IG assassin droid hung up on the wall, and Din says he wants to keep it as an advance on his fee.\nThe gang then flies back to Nevarro, and Greef Karga explain that they can hang out on the plot of land outside of town “between adventures” (he literally says that!), and Din presents him with a gift: the reconstructed IG-11, now fully operational since they were able to get the parts they needed from the other head. Remember that storyline? I thought they abandoned it!\nFinally, Din and Grogu relax at their little house, complete with a nice tree and a patio where Din can kick up his feet and chill out, watching as Grogu plays with a frog at a nearby pond. Everyone’s happy (except the frog). Everyone has achieved their goals. Another perfect ending for the show. Or not, because The Mandalorian is getting a fourth season.\nStray observations\n- This was largely an aimless season of The Mandalorian, but I enjoyed the ride. I don’t think any of it was necessarily bad, but it feels a little like they stretched out a somewhat slight and straightforward story to fill out the whole season. I would say, then, that things probably would’ve been more propulsive if the story of Din and Grogu reuniting had happened on this show rather than Book Of Boba Fett. It also would’ve made Grogu’s extensive Force-use in this episode feel more like a character beat—like he has grown and learned since we last saw him—than just a plot point.\n- It was pointed out to me that last week’s episode title, “The Spies,” may have been a reference to the story of the The Twelve Spies, in which a group of Israelites explore the desert to find a new home after leaving Egypt—you know, like the Mandalorians were doing. Seeing as how there were no spies in the traditional sense, I’m going to admit that the title was a smart reference that totally went over my head.\n- This episode never went back to Elia Kane on Coruscant, so we know Gideon still has an agent working for the New Republic. I don’t really care about that, but I am disappointed that it didn’t resolve the story of Kelleran Beq, so we don’t still don’t really know how Grogu survived Order 66.\n- There was also no post-credits stinger like there was last season, when they revealed The Book Of Boba Fett for the first time.\n- With a heavy sigh, given the playful one-sided feud the two of us have had ever since he started taking over Star Wars, I must acknowledge that one of the pilots in the background at the New Republic base was obviously Mandalorian co-creator Dave Filoni. He was wearing his cowboy hat and everything. Dave, I know we’ve had our differences and I’m the only person in the world who hates your reliance on ancient Jedi temples with access to outrageous fantasy magic (Star Wars: Rebels has TIME TRAVEL and nobody talks about that in any other Star Wars story), but all will be forgiven if you make that show about R5-D4.\n- Like a lot of people, I’ve had a shaky relationship with Star Wars since... December of 2019 or so, but I had fun with this. I hope you did too! I’ll always love this dumb universe, with its 5o-year-old babies and ancient cult of warriors who often get their butts kicked by space-gorillas, and The Mandalorian is still some of the best Star Wars around. This is the Way.",

            "text": "Star Wars: The Mandalorian Season 3 Episode 8 Review – The Return\nThe Mandalorian Chapter 24 delivers an action-packed ending to Din, Grogu, and Bo-Katan's latest Star Wars adventure!\nThis Star Wars: The Mandalorian review contains spoilers.\nThe Mandalorian Season 3 Episode 8: Chapter 24\n“The Return” is a satisfying ending to what has been a rock-solid season of The Mandalorian, with all of the show’s carefully laid-out storylines converging in spectacular fashion. The season was light on the core Din Djarin/Grogu dynamic, but the redirected focus on Bo-Katan and the reunion of the estranged tribes under the mantle of The Creed paid off, underlined emphatically by the (apparent) demise of Moff Gideon.\nOne of the most dramatic aspects of these past two episodes has been the emphasis on Gideon’s evil plans for Mandalore. He razed the planet, scattered its people, and then had the gall to use their sacred act of forging Beskar armor to bolster his own army of Imperial Mando-lites. Gideon violates. He exploits. He violently misappropriates. Everything he does feels deeply personal, which makes him one of the greatest villains in Star Wars history.\nEarly in the episode, Din Djarin asks Grogu to be brave and help him take out Gideon once and for all. Framing the conflict in this way is smart, as the duo are the undisputed beating heart of the show. Bo-Katan is proving to be a worthy co-protagonist, but she’s not quite there yet. Din Djarin and Grogu are the marquee players here, and it’s heartening to see them treated as such in the finale.\nIt was devastating to lose Paz Vizsla at the close of last week’s episode, but Axe Woves has assumed the lovable grunt role nicely here with his almost impossible feat of heroism that ultimately takes Gideon down. Him sitting alone in the bridge of the cruiser as it’s bombarded by TIE Bombers and Interceptors is a character-defining moment, and while the jet-pack escape kinda-sorta dampens the impact of his sacrifice (going out in a ball of flames would’ve been a truly kickass exit from the show), it’s nice to know that he’ll be sticking around to usher in the new age of Mandalore.\nFrom the symbolically verdant cave farms proving Mandalore’s surface is still fertile, to the iconic image of a Darksaber-brandishing Bo-Katan leading an army of flying Mandalorians into battle (sheesh, did that look cool), the story of the rebirth of Mandalore was given the perfect treatment. The season has been carefully building to this crescendo, and the payoff is oh so sweet. Seeing the Great Forge re-lit, the youngling sworn into The Creed at the Living Waters, and the Mythosaur opening its massive eye in approval is a well-earned, full-circle moment. Having Bo-Katan act as the face of this resurrection will surely lead to some big things in the Mandoverse down the road.\nBut again, the true main event here is Din Djarin and Grogu finally getting their hands on Gideon. They had to earn it, though, fighting through a grueling gauntlet of Imperial commandos and Praetorian Guards to get to him. The finale nails all of these sequences, from R5 having a little hero moment as he’s pestered by mouse droids (a welcome moment of levity amid a cacophony of brutality) to Din and Grogu tag-teaming to kick the shit out of the Praetorian Guards. The shot of the blast doors shutting as the Praetorians back a cowering Grogu into a corner is so heart-wrenching it makes you want to reach through the screen and save the little guy yourself. This little non-verbal, animatronic puppet is one of the best characters on TV, and that’s something the show’s crew and creatives should really be proud of.\nDin Djarin telling Grogu, “You did good, kid,” is absolutely everything. This IS the show. This duo is what makes this Star Wars series unique and special, and they really get to shine here as they overcome serious peril as father and son, with the aid of Bo-Katan and the rest of the Mandos, of course.\nThe theme of the season, that “Mandalorians are stronger together,” is a powerful one and is encapsulated perfectly in this finale. The people of Mandalore work selflessly to defeat a villain who is so self-obsessed and egomaniacal that he literally tried to make a clone army of HIMSELF (but with added Force powers) to take over the galaxy. The solidarity of many triumphs over the tyranny of one. A poetic ending indeed.\nGrogu saving Din Djarin and Bo-Katan with the Force bubble is terrific (Thanks, Master Luke!), and Din Djarin adopting him as his son and apprentice and settling down on Nevarro to start a new life as a little bounty-hunting family is just unbelievably cathartic and cute, made all the better by the true return of Taika Waititi’s IG-11. The final shot of our central duo is precious—Din Grogu deserves to use the Force for fun because he’s just a kid, damnit, and Din Djarin deserves to kick his feet up and enjoy the simple life. They finally feel like they’re both where they belong, and this could be a fitting ending to their story. Thankfully, this won’t be the last we see of the Din Fam, as showrunner Jon Favreau has already confirmed he’s written a fourth season. We can’t wait to see what’s next!",

            "text": "That’s all, folks. The Mandalorian season 3 has signed off with a surprisingly definitive ending that played it safe in most respects – but still left us wanting more from Din Djarin and (Din) Grogu in a galaxy far, far away.\nThose expecting a complex, heart-wrenching episode filled with twists and turns will see the writing on the wall almost immediately: Din’s quick escape from captivity completely undercuts the cliffhanger of the previous Chapter. It certainly can’t be accused of wasting time – much of the season has been spinning its wheels until now, after all – but sets the tone for everything being wrapped up a little too cleanly in favor of the good guys.\nAt least the action is well worth sticking around for – even if you can telegraph everything else well in advance. Mando’s messy, desperate fight through the shield barriers and towards Moff Gideon’s cloning bunker is an inspired set-piece that carries shades of Obi-Wan waiting behind while Qui-Gon Jin fought Darth Maul in The Phantom Menace. It also gives a chance for the choreography, probably one of the more overlooked aspects this season, to get its flowers – which is no bad thing.\nThat’s also the case for Bo-Katan’s stunning retaking of Mandalore, a fizzing aerial set-piece that again makes great use of The Volume and provides some serious tempo as Mando inches towards a showdown with Giancarlo Esposito’s glowering Moff Gideon.\nTheir tussle doesn’t disappoint, with Gideon getting the upper hand on more than one occasion and – finally – a sense of real peril as Grogu is cornered by the Praetorian Guards who dispatched Paz in the previous episode.\nInevitably, Bo-Katan swoops in to save the day, finally getting some revenge for giving up Mandalore to the Empire. That does come at a cost, however, as Gideon shows some much-needed physicality (his season 2 finale showing was weak, let’s be honest) to crush the Darksaber and get the upper hand on Bo-Katan. She, Mando, and Grogu are only saved when Axe Woves pulls off the impossible and crashes a Star Destroyer into the Imperial base.\nThe end result of the kamikaze act is a mixed one. Moff Gideon seemingly dies in a blaze of fury, an unsatisfying end to a villain that had so much more to give. Grogu’s hero moment, using the Force to shield the flames, is a much more earned character beat – and a deserving pay-off for the little guy’s training with Luke.\nChapter 24 is then wrapped up with the heartwarming reveal of Din Djarin adopting Grogu as his own son, all while The Great Forge burns again on a reclaimed Mandalore. The Mandalorian then sets out its mission statement for potential future seasons: Mando heads to Carson Teva of the New Republic and makes very clear his intentions are to go back to bounty hunting basics. If we get another season – and Jon Favreau has said we will – then expect a more chilled, low-key series of adventures involving Din Djarin and Grogu pottering around the galaxy and cleaning up hives of scum and villainy on the Outer Rim. Sign us up.\n‘The Return’, though, is guilty of being too risk-averse, introducing intriguing ideas and instantly tossing them to one side. Moff Gideon’s clones? Gone in an instant. How does Bo-Katan move on from not having the Darksaber? We never really find out. And what of the remnants of the Empire and the Shadow Council? A story for another day, perhaps. When even Axe Woves is unscathed from what should have been a suicide mission, that’s a bit of a red flag.\nBut if The Mandalorian ended now, it would be hard to find fault with how the curtain came down. Mando getting his own peaceful homestead on Nevarro is a fairly neat way to wrap up the series. Most other loose ends, too, have been tied away. In that respect, the season 3 finale is a job well done – even if it lacked the magnetic spark carried by Luke Skywalker’s savior act a few years back.\nAs for the season as a whole? The Mandalorian season 3 is perhaps the biggest victim of a post-Andor world. Simply, it was never the super in-depth show people now want it to be. There are no shades of gray here; good often triumphs over evil in Star Wars – and remains the case here.\nBut there are lessons to be learned. The world-widening Chapter with Doctor Pershing is a good blueprint of how to take this world forward away from Mando, while detours to Plazir-15 and a raptor’s nest, conversely, failed to dazzle with how often it took the spotlight from Din Djarin. If – and when – The Mandalorian returns, it needs to navigate its own space in the wider franchise with more purpose by focusing on what Mando, not anyone else, does best. Until then, we’ll be counting down the days until we can see Grogu and his new daddy once more.\nGet up to speed on the galaxy far, far away with our guide to everything announced at Star Wars Celebration 2023 and all the upcoming Star Wars movies and Disney Plus TV shows. Then get ready for more Star Wars adventures with what to watch before Ahsoka.",

            "text": "This review contains full spoilers for episode eight of The Mandalorian Season 3, now available to watch on Disney+.\nDin Djarin has been relegated to a secondary character for much of season 3 of The Mandalorian as the show focused on Bo-Katan’s quest to retake Mandalore and the struggles of the New Republic to maintain control of the Galaxy. But the titular character finally takes the spotlight again in an excellent finale that ties up the events of the last three seasons while setting the stage for new adventures to come.\n“The Return” picks up right where “The Spies” left off, with the Mandalorians in dire straits following Moff Gideon’s ambush. But the episode comes to resemble the conclusion of Return of the Jedi, splitting the action across multiple fronts as the divided Mandalorian forces work together to finally defeat their greatest foe.\nDin Djarin finally gets to really show off in this episode, breaking himself out of captivity and fighting the Darktroopers unarmed by skillfully maneuvering to make them turn their own weapons against each other. His scrappier fights are reminiscent of Daredevil, particularly the gauntlet he faces with the help of R5-D4, who helps put a uniquely Star Wars twist on the situation through his conflict with mouse droids. The questing structure of The Mandalorian often makes it feel a bit like a video game, but Din Djarin picking up progressively more powerful weapons took that similarity to a hilarious new level.\nWhile Din Djarin hunts for Moff Gideon within his base, Bo-Katan scrambles to regroup her forces. Axe Woves echoes the heroism of Paz Vizsla as he takes command of the capital ship, demonstrating just how vulnerable those big vessels are without smaller craft to scramble. This is the most epic scale conflict The Mandalorian has delivered, but it still feels small and scrappy — the forces of two broken empires facing down with everything on the line. That makes it feel more fulfilling than The Rise of Skywalker with its ludicrous number of ships and impossibly high stakes.\nThe cloning aspect of the episode feels a bit overwrought. If Moff Gideon’s clones are so important, why is it so easy to explode them all? Giancarlo Esposito is capable of being terrifying, but his performance doesn’t really land as he explains the grand plan that started with kidnapping Grogu. Given his chosen melee weapon and red-and-black horned beskar helm, Gideon clearly wanted to be heir to Darth Maul, the Darksaber-wielding Sith lord of Mandalore. It’s too bad he didn’t have more time to develop what could have been a compelling look at the way that one of the most brilliant and ruthless imperials viewed his own limitations. Perhaps that conflict can be further developed through Thrawn in Ahsoka. Can you really be the heir to the Empire if you’re not capable of demonstrating Palpatine’s level of raw power?\n“\nThe visit to the cave refuge of the surviving Mandalorians provides a nice break in the action. Much like the end of Wall-E, it provides a sign of hope that as ravaged as the surface of the planet is, it can still sustain life. It combines neatly with the rededication of Ragnar and the rekindling of the Great Forge of Mandalore in establishing the value of the resettlement of Mandalore and the reunification of its people, giving them the chance to be a real force again in a fractured galaxy. The crushing of the Darksaber closes a long chapter on Mandalorian lore, creating a possibility of a future that will no longer be defined by individual combat prowess.\nGrogu also really shines in this episode, reprising his role in the earliest episodes of The Mandalorian as an occasionally powerful protector of Din Djarin. He’s more consistent and clever now, and particularly well suited to evening odds, providing neat little assists in the fights against the Darktroopers, the Praetorian Guard and Moff Gideon through pushing away combatants and their weapons.\nRick Famuyiwa continues to utterly shine as a director, with each of the fights in this episode feeling distinct and meaningful. The music is also excellent, with riffs on Duel of the Fates and The Mandalorian theme bringing drama to the climax. The Praetorian Guard continue to be just pretty cool looking elite minions, but watching Din Djarin and Grogu take turns saving each other is deeply satisfying and helps establish just how much their dynamic has grown.\nLikewise, the episode also firmly establishes Din Djarin and Bo-Katan as equals. Neither one is really capable of taking Gideon down individually, but they’re each able to hold their own until they can demonstrate their shared strength, with some key assistance from Grogu. Their disparate narratives often felt at odds this season, but they came together neatly here, with some explosive help from Axe Woves, who even managed to survive blowing up Gideon’s base.\nThere’s strong use of CGI throughout the episode, with the fighting between the Mandalorians and Darktroopers almost looking like fireflies in the background of the central battle with Gideon. The shot of Grogu sheltering Bo-Katan and Din Djarin from the devastating fire of a capital ship crash encapsulates the wonder of the Force, a beautiful miracle used heroically. The fact that he just plopped down rather than passing out after also demonstrates just how much his power has grown over the course of three seasons.\nThe emotional denouement of “The Return” is just as important as its action, with Din Djarin finally fully embracing Grogu as his son and apprentice. The finale foreshadows a return to form for the show, with the duo heading on adventures together to follow the Way of the Mandalore. But it also offers the chance to use some of the plot from the scrapped Rangers of the New Republic show, with Din Djarin serving as an independent contractor solving problems in the Outer Rim. There’s even a happy ending for the quest to repair IG-11. He still can’t protect Nevarro from a pirate invasion, but at least the planet’s not entirely helpless.",

            "text": "After a season of false starts, Jon Favreau and Dave Filoni's The Mandalorian seemed to finally find its groove last week with \"Chapter 23: The Spies\". There was forward momentum, authentic character development, and huge Star Wars galaxy-altering stakes all wrapped up in a sleek package with some of the best action setpieces of the season. However, where \"The Spies\" ended on a cliffhanger ending that felt as if it left its characters and the audience dangling on the precipice of something new and exciting, the Season Three finale, \"Chapter 24: The Return,\" does little to capitalize on this.\nIf \"The Spies\" was the first two acts of a mini-Mandalorian movie, then \"The Return\" is its third act. It follows the further adventures of Din, Grogu, Bo-Katan, and co. as they attempt to retake Mandalore from Moff Gideon and his Imperial faction, with lots of action and resolution all around.\nIt is a joy to see longtime Mandalorian director Rick Famuyiwa get to go all-in on delivering high-octane Star Wars action. From an aerial, jetpack-aided mid-field clash to Din's John Wick-esque systematic takedown of Moff Gideon's top guards, Famuyiwa and cinematographer David Klein deliver superb action filled with clarity and impact. It's also wonderful to see Famuyiwa continue to spotlight character beats, first and foremost. There's a moment early on where it feels like Din actually makes an active choice in his own journey for one of the first times all season. Between Famuyiwa's direction and Pedro Pascal's delivery, the moment absolutely soars.\nBut the fact that it is one of Din's first real active choices all season long does hint at the bigger underlying problems which besiege the episode and the season at large. On the one hand, it's great that \"The Return\" concludes this story. Luke Skywalker doesn't randomly appear, Boba Fett doesn't come in and ride the Mythosaur, and a one-armed Mace Windu doesn't come swooping in to save the day; it's just a conclusion to these characters' story that doesn't allow an exuberance for larger Star Wars mythos to trample all over it, which is nice. Having said that, so many of the beats on display in Favreau's script feel recycled, unearned, or frustratingly deflating.\nWhether it's unceremoniously resolving threads such as Din's capture in a matter of seconds, giving Grogu the exact same heroic action beat he got back in the finale of Season One, or continuing to undermine Moff Gideon's alleged brilliance by committing to giving him the dumbest evil plans in Star Wars -- this episode is full of frustrating moments. Giancarlo Esposito's performance is magnificent, but it's become increasingly clear that that's really all there is or ever has been to Gideon. The character shows up for the final few episodes of any given season, Esposito gets to chew some scenery with a lot of great posturing and threatening, and then the character is proven to be kind of an idiot, again and again. He even gets a motivation here that is seemingly pulled straight out of Colin Trevorrow's script for Episode IX.\nOverall, Season Three of The Mandalorian can't help but feel like it just spent its entire existence biding its time. While it leaves Din and Grogu in a fun position that seems to promise the audience that next season will feature more rollicking adventures, it's a position that the characters could have easily been in at the start of this season. It ends without bothering to resolve much of the thematic work that dominated this season, instead spending its final minutes moving characters around on a narrative chessboard, undoing or undermining prior developments, or just resetting things altogether without any real motivation or meaningful intent behind it.\nIn the end, everything is more or less returned to the status quo. While \"The Return\" is a solid episode with stellar direction from Rick Famuyiwa and some real standout musical moments from composer Joseph Shirley, it is not the homerun this season desperately needed to make it all feel satisfactory.\nThe Mandalorian Season Three is now streaming in its entirety on Disney+.",

            "text": "Despite their flaws, the first two seasons of The Mandalorian seemed to have an overarching storyline and a clear end goal in mind. When Season 3 arrived, all of that changed with the status quo, as Bo-Katan (Katee Sackoff) was pushed to the forefront and an entirely new plot line emerged. The decision wasn’t wholly unwelcome, but it did force the series to half-heartedly abandon its two-season lead. By the penultimate episode last week, it seemed as though The Mandalorian had recollected itself and was, at long last, headed towards the culmination of three seasons of disjointed story threads—but that wasn’t the case.\nOn the surface, “The Return” delivers some semblance of a satisfying conclusion, one that feels like it may actually be the end of The Mandalorian as a series, but none of it is earned. True to form, it rushes past story beats without attempting to build on them, cuts off potential before it has the chance to come to fruition, and blatantly retreads familiar ground out of fear of delivering anything other than “safe.” As cruel as it sounds, the finale is the most “toys in a sandbox” the series has ever felt, and the kids playing with the action figures seem to have run out of ideas before recess was over.\nFollowing his capture last week, the episode opens with Din Djarin (Pedro Pascal/Brendan Wayne/Lateef Crowder) in the custody of Moff Gideon’s (Giancarlo Esposito) troopers. Though it seemed like The Mandalorian may revisit the sinister torture that the New Republic employed a few episodes ago, Din manages to escape before they can get to any interrogating. With the help of the IG-12-boosted Grogu, Din takes out the troopers with only a little damage.\nThe penultimate episode framed Din’s capture as a major set-up for the finale, however, it was only a blip in the expedited storyline. In the end, its purpose was to get him behind enemy lines—where he and Grogu got to discover and destroy Gideon’s hall of clones—and lay the groundwork for the final showdown with Moff Gideon. To his credit, Din recognizes that in order for them to move forward they’re going to have to beat Moff Gideon once and for all, though it isn’t the final battle audiences may have had in mind. While everyone should caution against expectations, it seems odd that The Mandalorian continues to dangle potential it fails to see.\nElsewhere on Mandalore, Bo-Katan and the rest of the Mandalorians retreat from the action to regroup. This takes them to an underground cave that the Mandalorian who survived the siege have been living in, which happens to be thriving with the native plants of Mandalore that Bo-Katan long thought died. It’s an interesting sojourn that seems to be trying to say something bigger about the reclamation of the Mandalorian homeworld, but it never really gets there. The series doesn’t allow for these quiet moments to remain quiet before barreling headfirst back into the action—which, admittedly, The Mandalorian does very well. And perhaps that’s because physicality is a language of its own, which helps to support the lacking dialogue elsewhere in the series.\nMoff Gideon has been a consistent “big bad” throughout The Mandalorian, but it seems they can’t quite rekindle the magic of the Season 1 finale showdown. His terror is largely castrated here, even with full beskar regalia. Star Wars is about more than just good versus evil, but its villains are some of the most iconic, and Moff Gideon pales in comparison to the scripts he’s given. The final showdown feels like someone desperately wanted to rekindle the magic of The Last Jedi’s throne room scene—complete with Praetorian Guards—without fully understanding why that scene stands out as a fan favorite. Which, given the uneven and clumsy styling of Season 3, is par for the course. Even when Bo-Katan arrives at the eleventh hour to provide a much-needed assist, the fight just doesn’t feel earned, and it doesn’t seem like it should be the final chapter of the season either.\nAfter all the back and forth about the Darksaber since Din won it in Season 2, it’s tossed aside and destroyed by Moff Gideon, largely undermining three series—including the animated ones—that built up its importance to the Mandalorians. In a way, this parallels how Season 3 has largely been viewed. The creatives took a good thing that was working well and threw it away in favor of the next big thing. The lack of energy behind this act of the story is palpable, and perhaps that is owed to its creatives focusing on other projects instead.\nThe Darksaber isn’t the only thing destroyed in the final showdown. Grogu’s short-lived ride-around-and-talk toy, IG-12, is destroyed in the fire when Axe Woves (Simon Kassianides) crashes the capital ship into Moff Gideon’s base to destroy it once and for all. Perhaps we should’ve seen how careless The Mandalorian is with the things it introduces after the Razor Crest was destroyed in Season 2. At least that, however, played a part in Din’s now-forgotten character development. After so much of Season 3 was focused on the Mandalorians’ return to Mandalore and Bo-Katan rising to take the throne, the finale speeds right past all of it. For fans of The Clone Wars, this was decades in the making, and it was treated as little more than a footnote in the race to the credits. Why would The Mandalorian sideline Din Djarin and his journey in favor of Bo-Katan’s story, and then butcher what could’ve been a really powerful moment in the history of Mandalorians? So much momentum plummeted straight to the mines beneath the planet in that instant.\nThroughout most of the season, The Armorer (Emily Swallow) has regarded Din as Grogu’s father, however, it seems he wasn’t really his father. After Ragnar (Wesley Kimmel) is rebaptized in the waters of Mandalore—with no mention of his recently deceased father or why he needs to take the Creed again—Din attempts to have Grogu made his apprentice, instead of just his foundling. The Armorer points out that he’s still too young to take the Creed (which was already established earlier in the season) and makes a comment about requiring his parent’s permission to allow Din to take it for him. This makes no sense, considering how many Mandalorians are brought in as orphaned foundlings. To this roadblock, Din decides to bypass it by adopting him (which, isn’t that what the whole foundling thing already was?) and The Armorer allows it, giving Grogu… Din’s first name.\nThe Rise of Skywalker’s ridiculous “Rey Skywalker” endnote has met its match with “Din Grogu.” Despite the well-documented and The Mandalorian contemporary knowledge that Mandos use family names—like Bo-Katan Kryze, Paz Viszla, and even Sabine Wren—The Armorer does not name the kid Grogu Djarin. Between this and the odd dialogue, a few episodes back that implied Din was Grogu’s ward, The Mandalorian continues to suffer from scripts that seem to forget themselves.\nAfter being tasked with taking his newly adopted son, Din Grogu, Din jets off to find Carson Teva (Paul Sun-Hyung Lee) to enlist as an independent contractor for the New Republic. His goal is to help the New Republic take down imperial remnants in the Outer Rim, and Din (the elder) doesn’t seem to care about getting an actual okay to take on this duty. This appears to be a blatant set-up for whatever comes next, but it also largely undermines what The Mandalorian attempted to do by showcasing the New Republic’s corruption and inadequacies mere episodes ago. All cops are bad cops until Din Djarin decides he’s going to be their personal bounty hunter, apparently. Worse yet, after letting Grogu ride around in his corpse for two episodes, Din collects a junked IG-11 unit from Carson to get the Anzellans on Nevarro to once again revive the dead droid. But wait! He’s not just a droid—he’s the new Marshall! Because apparently on Nevarro they’ll let just anyone become one.\nThe Mandalorian thinks it’s clever by paying off Greef Karga’s (Carl Weathers) offer to give Din land to settle on, which he doled out in the finale, but it seems to forget that the debt was paid already when Greef granted the Mandalorians land and asylum a mere handful of episodes ago. Of course, the covert barely took advantage of that offer before jettisoning off to Mandalore, but that doesn’t negate the fact that it was already tread-upon ground.\nWhile most of the audience knows that Dave Filoni is gearing up for a movie that will play into this corner of the universe, The Mandalorian Season 3's ending gives nothing to the general audience, who isn’t plugged into every piece of news, to look forward to. Din and Grogu are once cut off from the covert as they set off to be independent contractors for the New Republic, living alone on Nevarro. What was the point of uniting Mandalore and showing how well they work as a united force—one that Din gave his blood, sweat, and tears to rejoin—only to reset all of it?\nThe Mandalorian’s Season 3 finale is unfortunately a fitting end for a tonally disjointed season that was so focused on its destination that it forgot to enjoy the journey. The bar wasn’t raised, despite the concentrated attempt to make it seem like they did something monumental. With Moff Gideon’s ambiguous ending (no body, no death), the knowledge that the cloning project is far from over, and the lack of resolution for Dr. Pershing’s (Omid Abtahi) mid-season story, it’s painfully obvious that a potential Season 4 would just reset everything again. Maybe then they’ll get things right. Why take a new path when you’re stuck in an obvious groove? At this point, the only way to save The Mandalorian is to bring new voices into the writer’s room to help bring new life and ideas to a series that started out with so much potential, which ended up wasted in this third season.\nRating: C\nAll episodes of The Mandalorian Season 3 are available to stream on Disney+.",

            "text": "Does surprising straightforwardness count as a twist? If so, The Mandalorian’s Season 3 finale was as shocking as they come. The 24th chapter of the Star Wars franchise’s flagship series subverted audience expectations at every turn, not because of what did happen, but because of what didn’t. Its twist was its lack of twists.\nThe shortest of the series’ season finales—and the third-shortest episode of Season 3—methodically precluded or postponed several suspected and anticipated developments. After all the speculation about spies in the Mandalorians’ ranks—Lies! Deceptions!—nobody betrayed Bo or Mando. No one rode the Mythosaur, which could barely be bothered to stir from its nap. Moff Gideon wasn’t done in by the Darksaber or a fatal flaw in the forging of his beskar. Grogu didn’t dabble in the dark side or say his first word, Bo and Mando didn’t smooch, and Mando didn’t take off his helmet, leaving us to wonder whether Pedro Pascal ever visited the set this season. (He did make a cameo in the cast’s phone-camera montage.) Grand Admiral Thrawn didn’t debut, no other Mandoverse characters crossed over, and no post-credits scene set up a spinoff. The most astonishing revelation was that “Din” is evidently Mando’s last name.\nThere was probably no way for The Mandalorian’s latest finale to match last season’s sensational Luke Skywalker cameo, which coupled with Grogu and Mando’s first face-to-face gaze and subsequent, poignant parting. Jon Favreau didn’t try to top “The Rescue.” Instead, he tied a tidy but underwhelming bow on the overarching arc of a largely lackluster Season 3: The Mandalorians retook their planet and got their revenge against Gideon without Favreau working in any mind-blowing moments, linking the show more tightly to its shared universe, or laying a lot of groundwork for the fourth season. The result was a refreshingly self-contained, unexpectedly uncomplicated, and occasionally rushed climax. “The Return” is a feel-good finale that didn’t make me feel much pathos, suspense, or excitement. It’s less a season saver than a fittingly uneven ending to an off year.\n“The Return,” which was written by Favreau and directed by Rick Famuyiwa, begins with two scenes that set the tone for a high-stakes but somewhat low-adrenaline finale. First, Bo orders Axe Woves to evacuate the Mandalorian fleet, use Gideon’s former flagship as a decoy to distract the TIEs, and take the fight to the planet’s surface. Axe copies, seems to accept her instructions, and gives no indication that he’s about to turn heel. Then, less than two minutes into the episode, Mando escapes. Gideon, we glean, sent his prisoner off with an escort of two troopers whose beskar doesn’t make them much more formidable than standard stormtroopers. (Overconfidence is Gideon’s weakness—and faith in friends is the Mandalorians’ strength.) Mando, who’s been playing unconscious en route to detention, turns the tables by just sorta shoving his captors, then knocks one of them out with his wrists still tied together. The other eventually regains the upper hand, but Grogu appears just in time to crumple the trooper’s weapon and hold him in place while Din—or is it Djarin?—delivers a roundhouse-kick KO.\nWithout much muss or fuss, Mando is free and no worse off from the flames and blaster bolts that the troopers aimed his way. Although the rescue seems abrupt, the good news is that Mando and Grogu are together again, reunited as they were when Mando saved Grogu from Gideon in “The Rescue.” This isn’t the last time they’ll form a tag team in this episode—and it isn’t the last time a weapon will get crumpled, either. The quick confrontation foreshadows the fights against Gideon and the Praetorian Guards, and it also salutes the scene in the Season 1 finale when IG-11 sprayed bacta on Mando’s wounds. This won’t be the last time that “The Rescue” calls back to “Redemption.”\n“Grogu, I’m going to need you to be brave for me, OK?” Mando asks. “We can’t keep running. If we don’t take out Moff Gideon, this will never end.” On many occasions, Mando has dropped Grogu off at day care with the likes of Kuiil, Peli Motto, or Lizzo and set off to complete a quest on his own. There’s no safe harbor here, however, and after bailing out Mando more than once on Mandalore alone (not to mention his saves in previous seasons), Grogu has earned a permanent place by his dad’s side. Djarin—OK, that’s throwing me more than learning the name of “Baby Yoda”—asks whether Grogu is with him, which should go without saying: When the going gets tough, Grogu gets going.\nGideon knows that his prisoner has escaped: He’s standing at a Metroid-map-looking diagram of the underground facility, monitoring the movements of Mando and Grogu much as Mando used to track his bounties. He stalks off to deal with them himself, Darth Vader style, though he seems to take an indirect route. The next action sequence hinges on R5-D4, whom we’ve barely seen since the droid told Captain Teva the covert’s location in Chapter 21. Like Grogu, R5 kinda comes out of nowhere to solve Mando’s problems, but this is the finale, and the gang’s all here. (Including the decidedly loyal Axe, who takes on the TIEs single-handedly in the upper atmosphere after sending the rest of the cruiser’s crew and accompaniment to Bo’s aid.)\nMando can’t seem to decide whether he hates droids or loves them—R5 is his buddy now?—but if R5’s assistance isn’t as dramatic or emotional as IG-11’s sacrifice in Season 1, it still helps father and son out of a tight spot. First, the droid determines the location of Gideon’s command center; then, like R2-D2 bailing out Luke, Leia, Han, and Chewie by shutting down all the garbage mashers on the detention level, R5 shuts down all the Phantom Menace–esque laser gates barring the boys of Clan Mudhorn from their destination. Mando is unarmed, but the combination of plot armor and beskar allows him to take out the troopers one by one, incapacitating some and dropping others down the vintage open chasms prized by Imperial architects. It’s a fun enough fight, though it won’t make anyone forget the Duel of the Fates.\nIn the hall of cloning tanks beyond the hall of laser gates, Mando and Grogu confirm one of the few fan theories vindicated by “The Return”: Gideon has been trying to clone himself. Back in Chapter 19, Dr. Pershing complained that his “research was twisted into something cruel and inhumane, at the behest of a desperate individual intent on using cloning technology to secure more power for himself.” Back in Season 1, it seemed likely that Gideon sought Grogu’s high-M-count blood to advance what we now know as Project Necromancer: the Shadow Council’s ongoing effort to develop a viable clone host for Emperor Palpatine. Perhaps he was, at first; Gideon’s base on Nevarro housed clones that resembled strandcasts like Snoke.\nAs his lie last week about his own interest in cloning suggested, though, Gideon is freelancing as a self-serving clone creator, a project he tasked Elia Kane with wiping from Pershing’s mind. His research isn’t intended to resurrect or curry favor with Palpatine, or to support Captain Pellaeon and Brendol Hux, but to establish himself as the Force-sensitive leader the Imperials lack. And he would’ve gotten away with it, too, if it weren’t for those meddling Mandalorians who let all the liquid out of the clones’ tanks. For the third straight finale, Gideon’s scheme is thwarted, though the reveal of his latest special weapon lacks weight because the unattended, undefended clones are so quickly and easily dispatched. (Which isn’t to say that they can’t come into play down the road: Perhaps Project Necromancer will find some other way to repurpose whatever breakthroughs he and Pershing may have made.)\nBefore the inevitable big bad monologue and duel, we watch as Bo and the skiff crew—no, they’re not spies either—visit an underground garden where Mandalore’s native flora, like its armored inhabitants, have returned. The planet is repairing itself after eons of civil war, just as the splintered Mandalorian factions are. “Life persists,” says the skiff captain, channeling Ian Malcolm. And just as he adds that all the plants—like the people—need is “room to grow,” the Armorer (also still loyal!) reports that Bo’s reinforcements have arrived. Pumped by this display of unity and rebirth, Bo declares, “Let’s take back our planet” and jets off at the head of a flock of Mandalorians, Darksaber extended, to meet Gideon’s commandos in midair. It’s one of the episode’s most stirring shots, and a last hurrah for the soon-to-be-borked blade.\nBack at the base, Mando and Grogu go from asphyxiating clones (which seems ethically thorny) to confronting Gideon right next to his map room. (Somehow, he still seems to be standing in almost the same place despite having stalked off in his previous scene, which makes me wonder where he was going and why he didn’t intercept Mando before he killed the clones.) The two commence pummeling each other, which continues for some time and grows progressively less compelling once it becomes clear that, encased in beskar, they’re both basically invulnerable. (It’s a little like watching superheroes and supervillains punch each other at the end of a Marvel movie.) Mercifully, Bo flies down to join the melee and break up the monotony, assuring Din, “I’ve got this. Go save your kid.” After she taps in, Gideon taunts her: “What’s it gonna be this time? Surrender or fight?” It’s a rhetorical question.\nThe kid in question is in an adjacent room, where he has his hands full with the Praetorian trio. In classic Star Wars fashion, the guards have amputated one of IG-12’s arms and forced Grogu out of his Krang-esque conveyance. He evades them for a time via acrobatic leaps à la Luke, but he’s eventually pinned as Anakin and Obi-Wan almost were after their showdown with Dooku. Just as Yoda saved Anakin and Obi-Wan, Din—first name or surname, you decide—saves Grogu, returning the favor from earlier in the episode. Then the two fight as a true team, with Grogu’s timely Force pushes and pulls allowing Mando to outmaneuver and defeat the daunting enemies. “You did good, kid,” go the gruff congratulations.\nBack in the hangar, the duel between Gideon and Bo is going Gideon’s way: The Moff brings more fruitless slashing to an end by grabbing Bo’s hand and crushing the Darksaber. Why the hilt is crushable, I can’t say: In The Book of Boba Fett, Mando says, “The hilt is of a quality of beskar I have never seen before.” (Um, maybe it’s really low quality?) One way or another, the weapon fizzles out, prompting Gideon to gloat, “Mandalorians are weak once they lose their trinkets.” But Bo retorts with one more reprisal of her season-long refrain, “Mandalorians are stronger together,” just as Mando and Grogu return to the fray. Gideon still seems invulnerable, but unbeknownst to him, the cruiser of Damocles is hanging over his head: Woves, another Mandalorian Bo is stronger with than without, has aimed the plummeting, flaming cruiser at the base and abandoned ship.\nAs the cruiser makes cave-fall, Gideon is consumed by an even bigger fireball than the one that killed Gus Fring. Even if the flames don’t melt his beskar, he’ll be baked inside. It’s poetic justice: The perpetrator of the Night of a Thousand Tears is killed on Mandalore’s surface by a bombardment from the sky (and his former flagship). But our heroes, who’ve been fighting him to a standstill with their powers combined, are spared the same superheating by Grogu, who constructs an inflammable Force bubble around his adoptive parents. It’s a supersized version of his protective display against the flame trooper in the Season 1 finale.\nIt’s also not unlike the devastating death of Kanan Jarrus in Rebels Season 4, though this time the outcome is a lot less tragic.\nWith Gideon vanquished, it’s time for the “Yub Nub” portion of the program: Peace is in place, for the moment, and the Mandalorians are savoring their hard-fought victory. Beside the Living Waters, Ragnar finishes taking the oath that was interrupted by an alligator, and though we know no monster can resist him, his appetizing presence doesn’t summon the Mythosaur (though Grogu soon touches the beast’s mind and makes it open its eyes). With Ragnar’s ceremony complete, Mando announces that Grogu is no longer a foundling: He’s an apprentice, too. “He is too young to speak, so he is too young to take the Creed,” the Armorer objects, which seems like a setup for Grogu’s long-awaited first words.\nInstead, it’s a prelude to adoption: If Mando becomes Grogu’s legal guardian, in the eyes of the cult, he can give parental consent. “Let it be written in Song that Din Djarin is accepting this foundling as his son,” the Armorer intones, telling Grogu, “You are now Din Grogu, Mandalorian apprentice.” (Thank goodness Grogu evidently doesn’t have to have a helmet yet, though that’s still on the table if the Children don’t eventually relax their still-rigid internal rules.) Early in the episode, Mando asked Grogu, “Will you cut me loose?” Now they’re forever bound together. Last season, Djarin gave Grogu up for adoption by Luke; here he makes his own fatherhood official.\nAfter the baptism, Bo lights the Great Forge, and her quest is all over but the shouting: “For Mandalore!” Then it’s time to tie up a couple of loose ends. Din Djarin and Din Grogu fly to Adelphi Base, where (as Dave Filoni’s Trapper Wolf looks on) Djarin offers to become an independent contractor working for Captain Teva. (It turns out that Mando is the ranger of the New Republic that Cara Dune was once supposed to be.) Djarin and Grogu also spot an IG head behind the bar that they take to their next stop, Nevarro. There, a rebuilt IG-11 is installed as marshal and takes up pirate patrol, and Greef gives Djarin and Grogu the keys to\nthe city a cozy cabin outside town. That’s where we leave them: Mando, with his legs up, lazes outside his homestead, while Grogu blissfully levitates a frog. I want to go to there.\nThere’s a lot to like about this resolution. Though the season strayed too often from its dynamic duo, the denouement is all about them, as the iris out emphasizes.\nIn Westerns, gunslingers so rarely get to go inside and enjoy the spoils of civilization. As Mando notes in his pep talk to Grogu, the two have been on the run since Season 1. Frankly, I love this quiet life for them: They deserve domestic bliss and a place with more space than the starfighter they’ve been living out of all season.\nI also appreciate that “The Return” steered clear of the most obvious paths to victory: Gideon being felled by a beskar defect and the Mythosaur riding to the rescue seemed like such locks that the TV bookmakers probably weren’t taking action on either, yet neither came to pass. I still have some questions—if the Imperials’ armor isn’t shoddy, what was with the beskar fragment embedded in the prison transport’s wall?—but ultimately, it’s satisfying that the Mandalorians’ triumph didn’t rely on objects, symbols, or wildlife. The Mythosaur that rose up to herald a new age of Mandalore wasn’t the actual Mythosaur (which didn’t really rise up at all); it was, perhaps, the painted Mythosaur skull on Gideon’s commandeered flagship. Bo hadn’t “lost everything” when the Darksaber was destroyed; she had gained much more through comradery. The Darksaber suffered an ignominious end for something with so much buildup and lore, but the weapon was never that important to Mando, who followed Bo out of loyalty to her, not to her sword. Those icons and legends were merely means to an end, keys to unlock the combined clans’ strength. And when Gideon went down, it wasn’t in single combat; it was a true team effort. Maybe the governance of Mandalore can be, too.\nThere were disappointments, too. Not because “The Return” deflated fan theories—I respect red herrings, and it’s never wise to let the show you think you’ll see interfere with the one you’re watching—but because catharsis was in short supply. Although the focus was once more on Mando and Grogu by the end, the adoption didn’t deliver as much emotion as their previous unions or separations. I wasn’t wondering when Mando would formally adopt Grogu. As far as I was concerned, he’d adopted him already: There hasn’t been any doubt about those characters’ commitment to each other since Grogu left Luke. Meanwhile, Mando’s attitude toward the Creed and his helmet wearing didn’t evolve at all, even though the Armorer embraced a more ecumenical stance. (It’s hard not to wonder whether Pascal’s availability drove that decision.) Nor did Grogu seem to struggle with his growing power, or require his dad’s guidance to synthesize nonviolent Jedi teachings with more martial Mandalorian traditions. (Grogu successfully strikes that balance on his own.)\nAnd while it was nice to be back with the boys, it would’ve been nice to see a post-battle confab (not to mention a make-out sesh) between Bo and Djarin, given Bo’s centrality to the season. After all they survived and accomplished together, some closing conversation, heartfelt goodbye, or indication of a future together was warranted. Last, I didn’t care for the comeback of IG-11, which undercut the droid’s sacrifice in Season 1. At least dub the new marshal IG-13 to show that this is a different droid! (Couldn’t the Dins have served as part-time marshals when not on New Republic business?)\nIn delivering an unreserved victory for the Mandalorians and a resounding demise for Gideon—unless he has clones stashed elsewhere and somehow returns—Chapter 24 left so few prominent plot threads dangling that it felt more like a series finale than a season ender. However, there’s more Mandalorian on the way. So what’s in store for Season 4, which is already written, though not yet announced or filmed?\nThat idyllic last scene could prefigure a fourth season that’s more like the first, which wouldn’t be unwelcome: another “return,” this time to a more episodic structure. “You and the little one, you can settle down, you can hang up your blaster,” Greef said in the season premiere. “Live off the fat of the land.” Sounds sweet! It also sounds unlikely, though, considering the ever-expanding scope of this series and the Mandoverse at large: There are spinoffs to support and a movie to set the stage for. As the Armorer said, “You must leave Mandalore and take your apprentice on his journeys, just as your teacher did for you.” (Wait, who was Mando’s teacher? Is she talking about herself? Is Din her name?)\nIn light of this low-key ending—and the Book of Boba Fett precedent—it wouldn’t be surprising to see The Mandalorian’s stars show up in Ahsoka and/or Skeleton Crew later this year. Grogu’s purrgil sighting in the premiere and Mando’s loose affiliation with the New Republic provide plenty of ways for them to tangle with Thrawn now that Gideon has ceded his seat on the Shadow Council. Plus, what about Bo? Is there much more of Mandalore’s story to tell in The Mandalorian, or will she show up on other spinoffs or get her own show like Fett?\nA few years ago, I used this GIF of Ahsoka gracefully touching down on Mandalore to illustrate how The Clone Wars stuck the landing in its series finale.\nAll in all, “The Return” landed more like this:\nI described “The Return” as a feel-good finale, but I don’t feel that good about it. It was more of a safe chip and putt to stay out of a sand trap or pond and avoid a double bogey than a risky but brilliant birdie to get back to even par. That’s not solely the finale’s fault; it’s also a reflection of the failings of the first six episodes. This was a strange season, one that clearly paid a price for The Book of Boba Fett fast-forwarding through Grogu’s training and reunion with Mando, some distracting detours and spinoff and sequel service, and, perhaps, the demands on Favreau as Filoni—who, in a departure from past seasons, didn’t direct or get sole screenwriting credit on any episodes—helmed or helped oversee The Mandalorian, The Bad Batch, Tales of the Jedi, and Ahsoka almost simultaneously. (Favs, please proofread and revise those Season 4 scripts carefully.)\nBecause fans and industry analysts tend to track the rising and falling fortunes of IP the way they obsess over sports, perceptions of franchise well-being seem to swing wildly with each release. Recency bias is built into the constant temperature checks and trend pieces. Consider how the conversations surrounding the critical acclaim and popular appeal of Star Wars shifted from Book of Boba and Obi-Wan Kenobi to Andor to the first several installments of The Mandalorian Season 3. Even with a wobbly slate of episodes from Favreau and Co., though, the state of Star Wars feels fairly strong.\nThe franchise is nothing if not prolific: Jedi: Survivor, the much-hyped sequel to Jedi: Fallen Order, comes out later this month, followed by the animated Visions and Young Jedi Adventures in early May. After ceding the summer spotlight on Disney+ to the MCU’s Secret Invasion, Star Wars will strike back later in 2023 with Ahsoka and Skeleton Crew (which will likely sandwich the second season of Loki). Next year will bring the premiere of The Acolyte, the return of Tales of the Jedi, the conclusions of Andor and The Bad Batch, and potentially more Mandalorian or Ahsoka. And there are, at last, more timeline-stretching movies in the making, though they’re years away. The Mandalorian’s success made much of this small-screen proliferation possible. And now that the first live-action Star Wars series has stumbled—temporarily, at least—it’s on the projects it spawned to pick up some of the slack.",

            "text": "The Mandalorian\nAfter the previous episode, it was pretty obvious that the season finale would be action-packed, but did anyone expect it to be this action-packed? “Chapter 24: The Return” begins at full speed and doesn’t really slow its pace until the denouement. The episode opens with Bo-Katan barking orders to Axe Woves and coming up with a plan of attack on the fly as she runs down a corridor, and it only builds from there. We don’t even have to wait long to see Grogu in action in his IG-12 combat suit. He’s got moves too. After rescuing Din Djarin from a couple troopers wearing beskar armor (accompanied by a string of mechanical “Nos”), Grogu gets his own orders from a grateful Din: It’s time to take out Moff Gideon once and for all.\nThis will prove tricky. As Bo-Katan leads her troops to safety, and Gideon’s TIE fighters and bombers take to the sky, Gideon — looking more like a Darth Vader wannabe than ever in his gleaming black armor — declares that he’ll take out his opponents. Gideon’s enemies have the same idea, but first they’ll have to find him, which means calling the timid-but-committed R5-D4 to action to determine Gideon’s location and otherwise assist in their pursuit (a task that will require him to fend off some pesky mouse droids). It’s a big episode for R5, who rises to the occasion. We always knew he had it in him!\nMeanwhile, a battle rages in the skies over Mandalore, but it’s not quite the battle Gideon believes it to be. The fighters throw themselves at the Mandalorians’ commandeered Imperial cruiser, but most of the Mandalorians have already started to make their way down to the planet. That leaves Axe to fly the ship and fight off Gideon’s forces on his own, which he does until he’s forced to bring the cruiser down in a blaze of glory. (Fortunately, he makes his own heroic escape before it crashes to the surface, doing incalculable damage to Gideon’s base in the process.)\nBut before the cruiser reaches its fiery fate, Din and Grogu figure out what, exactly, Gideon’s been up to. The bodies in those chambers? They’re not just clones, they’re clones of Gideon. And, as Gideon later explains, his plan is even more sinister than that. He wanted Grogu in order to splice the Force abilities onto the clones. Fortunately, Din and Grogu take them out before they can be much of a threat. But they still have to reckon with Moff Gideon (original flavor). This, unsurprisingly, isn’t easy. As Din fights Gideon one on one, the trio of Praetorian Guards shows up and take him down. They were ready for Din. But they weren’t ready for Grogu, who proves to be a formidable foe even after he’s stripped of his IG-12 suit. (It was fun while it lasted.)\nWhile that’s going on, Bo-Katan gets an introduction to a side of Mandalore she’s never seen, one that might point to its future. In a shelter inhabited by the Nite Owls left on the planet, she sees an underground garden planted by the survivors, an indication that not only could the great domed cities be brought back to life but the whole planet. It’s a brief, quiet moment before the combat resumes via an all-out assault on Gideon’s forces that pits rocket-pack-wearing Mandalorians against rocket-pack-wearing troopers. It’s pretty thrilling stuff. “The Return” takes the task of sending the season off with a bang seriously, and these are some of the best action scenes we’ve seen on The Mandalorian.\nAs Din finishes off the Praetorian Guards and rescues Grogu, Bo-Katan takes over Moff Gideon–fighting duties, Darksaber in hand. For a while at least: When he can’t reclaim the Darksaber, Gideon destroys it, leaving Bo-Katan without the symbol of her leadership. But by now, she undoubtedly realizes that she doesn’t need it to be a leader to her people. “Mandalorians are stronger together,” she tells Gideon shortly before Din and Grogu arrive to help finish Gideon off. (Presumably. He has proven resilient before.) With Grogu’s protection, they emerge triumphant from the flame that engulfs their foes.\nAfter that, it’s all over but for the victory ceremony. After the Armorer promotes a young Mandalorian into the ranks using the Living Waters of Mandalore for the first time in years, she’s given another apprentice who wants the same: Grogu. Unfortunately, only those with parents can become Mandalorians if they can’t speak to take the Creed themselves. Fortunately, Grogu now has one: Din Djarin, who formalizes the bond others have talked about all season. Grogu is now officially his adopted son, Din Grogu. Beneath the Living Waters, the Mythosaur opens its eyes in apparent approval — like some kind of benevolent Cthulhu waiting for its moment to return.\nThe season ends with a setup of what’s to come. Lighting the Great Forge, Bo-Katan formalizes her leadership. Visiting the New Republic bar where Captain Teva hangs out, Din offers his services (off the books, of course). Then, on Nevarro, Din takes up Greef Karga’s offer of land but not the job of marshal. That job belongs to IG-11, who’s now fully restored to his old self and eager to help. With the happy image of Din Djarin and Din Grogu at rest (made even happier by Grogu’s decision not to eat the frog he’s levitating), we’re done for the season.\nWe already know that The Mandalorian will be back for a fourth season, because creator Jon Favreau said he has already written it. Beyond that, Din Djarin and Grogu are now part of a plan set to culminate in a feature film that will bring together all the disparate strands of the TV universe Favreau and Dave Filoni have been building since The Mandalorian premiered in 2019. But the end of this third season could easily work as a series finale. Questions introduced in the earliest episodes — Who is Moff Gideon and what’s his ultimate plan? Will Din Djarin ever settle down and give that little creature he clearly loves a nice home? — have been answered. The final scenes establish a new status quo that’s essentially the old status quo, but now Din Djarin’s using his skills as a bounty hunter exclusively to serve the good guys. It’s not the last we’ll see of these characters, but it plays like a happy ending for our heroes — at least for now.\nBounty Pucks\n• Of course, the episode still left plenty of unfinished business to pick up when The Mandalorian returns (unless Ahsoka or some other related series gets to it first). Chief among them: the plans of the Shadow Council and the presence of spies like Elia Kane in the New Republic midst.\n• Can we assume Gideon’t really, truly dead? Probably not. Any character who loves clones as much as he did could return unexpectedly (and maybe even in multiple bodies).\n• Will Grogu be wearing Mandalorian armor next time we see him? That seems unlikely, if only because the series wouldn’t be the same without his cute little face. (Although putting the little guy in beskar armor could be pretty cute.)",

            "text": "Editor’s Note: The following contains spoilers about the seventh episode of “The Mandalorian,” Season 3, “The Return.”\nTo borrow a line from another Disney+ series, it’s been the Empire all along.\nAfter a somewhat disjointed third season, “The Mandalorian” took a big step toward crystallizing its next phase in the last two episodes, which officially brought back the villainous Moff Gideon (Giancarlo Esposito) and made clear that much of the evil unfolding across the galaxy was the work of former Imperial operatives, plotting behind the scenes to undermine the hapless New Republic.\nIn the process, the show has moved to putty in some gaps left by the most recent movie trilogy, including the rise of the First Order and the return of Emperor Palpatine, what with all the talk of a cloning operation that received a somewhat abbreviated discussion in the race to wrap things up with “Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker.”\nThe finale, “The Return,” used that foundation to mount an epic battle, pitting the Imperial forces – newly outfitted for the cause – against the reunited soldiers of Mandalore, a warrior culture whose ethos was nicely embodied by the sequence in the penultimate chapter in which one nobly sacrificed himself in order to facilitate the escape of his brethren. It was the kind of cinematic sequence that would surely play well in the planned movie that will capitalize upon this timeline of the “Star Wars” universe.\nThe episode also featured Bo-Katan Kryze (Katee Sackhoff), the Mandalorian leader, cementing her claim to that title as she faced off against Moff Gideon, eventually with a little help from her friends, Din Djarin (voiced by Pedro Pascal) and Grogu. At the end of that fight, the latter again displayed the vast potential of his Jedi powers in saving them from a fiery death.\nThrow in muscular moments like that, and simpler pleasures like Grogu using his robot shell, and even when it’s a little clunky the series can still be a great deal of fun.\nIndeed, executive producers Jon Favreau and Dave Filoni have turned “The Mandalorian” into a key linchpin in Lucasfilm’s larger plans, advancing a broader picture than just the travels of Din Djarin and Grogu.\nThat said, after resolving the fate of Mandalore, the finale essentially hit the reset button on the show’s central premise in the form of happy ending. That involved formalizing the central duo’s bond by having the Mandalorian adopt Grogu, before assuming a new bounty-hunting role focused on pursuing Imperial remnants across the galaxy.\nNotably, the seventh episode included a reference to Thrawn, the villain from the animated “Star Wars Rebels” who will be featured in the upcoming live-action series “Ahsoka” – further evidence, if any was needed, that “The Mandalorian” fully embraced the well-worn Disney practice of adapting its animated properties into live-action formats.\nOverall, to say the third season wasn’t always neat or pretty would be an understatement. Some of the frustration expressed about its arc was understandable.\nStill, if you’re blessed with a show that has the latitude to indulge in odd detours while advancing a larger objective – serving as the jumping-off point to explore what has become a fertile quadrant of “Star Wars” mythology – for now, this is the way, warts and all.",

            "spaceyToken": "Right",
            "text": "Right from the very beginning, there’s always been a little fairytale DNA in Star Wars. Not only because George Lucas’ first film followed the archetypal hero’s journey narrative — just, with its farm-boy cultivating moisture rather than livestock, and its wise old man boasting Force powers and a laser sword — but in those simple blue words that begin every Skywalker Saga film: ‘A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away…’ And while The Mandalorian is a show that’s dabbled in various genres over time, channelling Westerns, samurai stories, heist tales, spy-thrillers and more, Season 3 delivered a properly fairytale ending — so much so, it might as well have closed on a blue text card of its own: ‘And they all lived happily ever after.’\nProbably the biggest surprise of ‘Chapter 24: The Return’ (is it a coincidence that the concluding act of Joseph Campbell’s hero’s journey structure is ‘Return’?) was how, well, final the finale felt. Not just as the ending of this latest arc of Din Djarin and Grogu’s (sorry, Sir Din Grogu’s) tale, but of everything Dave Filoni and Jon Favreau’s show has established so far. If this wasn’t Star Wars – with its ‘no-one’s ever really gone’ continuous narrative drive — you’d be forgiven for thinking that the story was over. Moff Gideon seems to have been vanquished (albeit with much wiggle room should they wish to bring him back). Din has officially been named as Grogu’s father, adopting him and gifting him a pre-surname (cue much confusion over how Mandalorian family names work). They even have an adorable little house together, choosing to live on the outskirts of Nevarro rather than on Bo-Katan Kryze’s freshly reclaimed Mandalore. The story that began all those years ago, with Din Djarin accepting a simple job to track down a mysterious 50-year-old being, actually concluded here.\nAs endings go, it was a neat one — tying together the admittedly disparate threads of Season 3 while also paying off the bigger picture. For all that this latest run has sometimes felt in need of a clearer direction — largely centreing Bo-Katan over Din Djarin and Grogu, spending an episode (fascinatingly) exploring the state of the New Republic, and moving away from the streamlined mission-of-the-week simplicity of the early seasons for a deeper dive into Mando-lore – everything ultimately connected. The quest to reclaim Mandalore was directly tied to Moff Gideon’s return; Gideon’s masterplan to create a Beskar-clad, Force-wielding army of his own clones instigated the entire story, revealed as the reason he put out a bounty to acquire Grogu in the first place; the acceptance of Grogu into the Mandalorian culture required the kid to be officially named as Din Djarin’s adopted son, cementing their familial bond; the newfound peace of Din Djarin and Din Grogu’s domestic set-up dovetailed with the Mandalorians’ re-taking of their own homeland, both attained by the ultimate destruction (or is it?) of Moff Gideon. Everything came full circle.\nIf anything, it was a circle that hammered home that feeling of finality — or, more specifically, an iris edit in the final shot. There was already something homely about Din Djarin sitting nonchalantly on his porch – feet quite literally up — while Din Grogu toyed with a wriggling frog a few metres away, the pair exuding a sense of calm and stability that has eluded them ever since they first came together. But the frame circling in on our father-son duo elevated this image of harmony, delivering a moment of closeness — and, yes, finality. It was the editing equivalent of ‘The End’, of a storybook closing. ‘All was well.’ Maybe, in true George Lucas style, we could have got an American Graffiti-style text wrap-up. ‘Din Djarin enjoyed his regular freelance gig with Carson Teva for many happy years, and soon adopted a handful of Anzellans. Din Grogu ate many one-eyed frogs, and was very happy for several centuries before retiring to Dagobah.’\nSurely, though, this isn’t the end. For one thing, Jon Favreau has spoken about having written The Mandalorian Season 4 already — which, unless a sneaky misdirect, means there are more Mando-Grogu adventures to come. There are still threads left dangling — not just Din’s new arrangement with Carson Teva to pick up off-the-books jobs for the New Republic, but the regular teases that Grogu isn’t able to speak… yet. And with the recent announcement at Star Wars Celebration 2023 that Dave Filoni will be directing an upcoming Star Wars movie, tying in characters across The Mandalorian, Ahsoka, and more, that the duo will be back seems unavoidable — why would you make a film set during this era and not include the two most wildly-popular, instantly-recognisable characters?\nIf it’s not the end, then, it does at least feel like the end of an era. Assuming that Moff Gideon really is dead — with the caveat that his Beskar armour might have shielded him from the fireball that engulfed him on Mandalore, and that his clone project means a ‘Somehow, Gideon returned’ moment isn’t out of the question – then the stage is set for the start of something new, handing the villainous baton over to Lars Mikkelsen’s Grand Admiral Thrawn, waiting in the wings to make his live-action debut in Ahsoka this August. Filoni has talked up Thrawn as the big bad of this New Republic era — his impending arrival could mark the start of a whole new chapter. Or, perhaps Season 4 will be a back-to-basics shrugging off of this season’s lore-heavy story, cleaning the slate for a simpler set of adventures next time around. Maybe, the next time we see Din Grogu he won’t be Baby Yoda any more — the kid has to grow(-gu) at some point, and while it would come at the expense of some of that joyful cuteness, a slightly older Child would deliver real character development.\nFor now, though, The Mandalorian Season 3 ending feels like an exhalation point – a chance to stop and smell the freshly mown space-grass in Grogu and Mando’s front yard. (And goodness, what a beautiful final shot that is — so open and airy and restful, gorgeously scored too.) Before jumping ahead to whatever’s next, let’s appreciate this moment of narrative closure and revel in a happy ending for our beloved characters, who have finally earned a bit of hard-won peace. It might not be ‘Happily ever after’, but this finale still felt like a definitive statement. For now, their song is written.",

            "text": "TAGGED AS: Disney, Sci-Fi, science fiction, streaming, television, TV\n(Photo by Lucasfilm Ltd.)\nClick image to view full poster in a new tab.\nWhile the title of last week’s episode, “The Spies,” left many wondering if a traitor hid under a Mando helmet and the overall tone made us wonder if everything would end with a Charge of the Light Brigade, the final installment of The Mandalorian’s third season — “The Return” — makes it clear what to expect. But just who or what returned and what does it mean in the short term for the New Republic, subsequent seasons of the series, and the further-flung future of Star Wars. Let’s take a look at the various returns and their potential meanings.\nSpoiler alert: The following reveals details from the seventh episode of The Mandalorian season 3, “Chapter 24: The Return.” Stop reading here if you have not watched the episode and wish to avoid spoilers.\n(Photo by Lucasfilm Ltd.)\nDuring a tactical retreat, Bo-Katan Kryze (Katee Sackhoff) learns from the survivors who remained planetside that they have been planting native vegetation in a network of caves across Mandalore. The revelation is significant as most of the planet has been inhospitable to agriculture for centuries. As Bo-Katan herself puts it, life outside the domed cities was an impossible ask — even in her lifetime. That soil could be suitable for crops in just 25 years illustrates that Mandalore is as resilient as its people, but also just how devastating the in-fighting must have been across the generations.\nMaybe this is why the Mythosaur slept for so long and, potentially, why it did not reveal itself to the Mandalorians when they assembled at the Living Waters to complete Ragnar Vizsla’s (Wesley Kimmel) induction. The planet may still regard them as hostile invaders.\nAt the same time, the survivors’ success with farming points to a way forward for the Mandalorians. When they start to rebuild their cities, they will not have to enclose them in domes. Additionally, they may be able to begin a new farming boom in the caves just under the surface even as they rein in the wilder animal life above and below. Would a surplus of food allow them a new way to interact with the galaxy? Potentially. But it remains to be seen if The Way will allow that sort of commerce in its strict warrior code.\nThen again, will Mandalore even want to interact with the galaxy at this point?\n(Photo by Lucasfilm Ltd.)\nDespite the odds and a penultimate episode as grim as Star Wars: The Bad Batch’s season 2 finale, Bo-Katan, Axe Woves (Simon Kassianides), the Armorer (Emily Swallow) and the others did what seemed impossible just seven weeks ago. The retaking of Mandalore may have been a little too swift for some, but for others, the plot point has been decades in the making. And, as Moff Gideon (Giancarlo Esposito) suggested last week, a united Mandalorian race could be formidable opposition to the Imperial Remnant. Even the others on the Shadow Council agreed with that, offering him additional resources to stop the threat.\nHe failed in spectacular fashion, of course — a tactical sacrifice on the part of Grand Admiral Thrawn (Lars Mikkelsen) to remove a rival perhaps? — but not before critically damaging the Darksaber. That detail may affect a more long-running development for the Mandalorian people. Will Bo-Katan be able to lead with it destroyed?\nOne option, of course, is to simply rebuild it. Bo-Katan knows someone trained in the Jedi arts who could potentially aid her in that endeavor. But it is also possible her efforts in retaking the planet will change the requirements to rule it. Actions speak as loudly as superstition among the Mandalorians and with Bo-Katan now claiming they are stronger together, dogma may be massaged to allow her, at long last, to lead without her succession constantly being questioned.\n(Photo by Lucasfilm Ltd.)\nIndeed, the Armorer’s seeming tolerance of mainstream Mandos who remove their helmets suggests The Way can be flexible. Or at least, stretched enough for the good of restoring the world and reuniting the people. If she has any ambitions of her own, it will likely take the form of converting people to her interpretation of The Way. Its crucial presence in the retaking of the world will be a powerful recruitment tool.\nNevertheless, it is interesting that victory was achieved without this tension about Mando religion being resolved. Well, at least in dialogue. Allowing Bo-Katan to relight the Great Forge without her helmet is a striking visual, as is the image of Mandos with and without helmets shouting “For Mandalore” in unison. Perhaps a season 4 episode will come back to this topic or, perhaps, it is something executive producers Jon Favreau and Dave Filoni will return to much later.\nAs we’ve mentioned across the season, Mandalorians are completely absent from the Sequel trilogy. That could be down to the interests of directors J.J. Abrams and Rian Johnson in that part of the timeline or an indication that this grand reunification failed as it has for the Mandalorians across millennia. But considering the planet is shielded from the outside galaxy by its atmosphere, it is also possible the people looked inward for a generation as the First Order rose and fell.\nIf that’s the case, it would be interesting to see them gain a wider presence just as Rey’s (Daisy Ridley) New Jedi Order takes shape some forty years later.\n(Photo by Lucasfilm Ltd.)\nAs we mentioned last week, The Mandalorian started with a vibe borrowed from the Japanese manga series Lone Wolf and Cub. We’ll even argue this season, despite abandoning the wandering mercenary format, still echoed some of writer Kazuo Koike and artist Goseki Kojima’s longer tales of ronin assassin Ogami Itto and his child. But no matter how consciously Favreau regarded the manga for this part of the story, he seemed to make a promise that the initial format will return next season.\nFollowing Ragnar’s induction, Din Djarin (Pedro Pascal) requested the same for Grogu. But as The Way is forever revealing new wrinkles, the Armorer leveled several objections — starting with Grogu’s inability to speak Basic (the common language across the hyperspace lanes) to the fact his parents could not offer consent for The Mandalorian to train him as an apprentice.\nThe back and forth culminated with Djarin adopting Grogu and revealing “Din” is his family name. That detail is interesting for us as we’ve gone back and forth on calling The Mandalorian “Din” or “Djarin” — an indecision inspired by the fact that, much like Boba Fett (Temuera Morrison), the name never sounds quite right without both words being present. But it also suggests a link to Djarin’s past prior to being adopted by the Watch. Perhaps that link will be something for Din Djarin and Din Grogu to search out while once again wandering the galaxy.\n(Photo by Lucasfilm Ltd.)\nRoaming is Djarin’s new mission as proscribed by the Armorer. This time, though, part of the assignment is to train Grogu in the ways of the Mand’alor before he can finally commit to the Creed in his heart and by his words. To us, that means season 4 — which Favreau claims is already written — will return to the more episodic format of the first two seasons as the Clan of Two work New Republic bounties and, occasionally, take breathers in the house on Nevarro.\nAfter a season of action with galactic implications and ties to the greater story Filoni will tell on Ahsoka and his feature film debut, returning to the episodic wandering will be welcomed by many. And, of course, it still echoes the format of Lone Wolf and Cub, which also switched between short tales and longer epics.\nAnd, we assume, Grogu will finally say “The Way, this is” before too long.\n(Photo by © 2020 Lucasfilm Ltd. & ™. All Rights Reserved.)\nOur last return for the episode is more of a suggestion as Boba Fett remains an outlier among the Mandalorians. Sure, many grumble at the ultimate execution of The Book of Boba Fett, but his continued presence in the galaxy is a story point. And as the acknowledged successor to Jabba’s criminal enterprise, he seemingly takes the place of Talon Karrde in any adaptation of Timothy Zahn’s Thrawn trilogy. Although, in hindsight, Karrde would’ve made a great antagonist for the former bounty hunter in his eponymous series.\nNo matter his future in the wider part of Filoni’s story, his status as a Mandalorian is still in question and if Bo-Katan truly believes her people are stronger together, than settling matters with him is something she will have to undertake.\n(Photo by Lucasfilm Ltd.)\nThis notion also extends to the other known Mando out in the galaxy: Sabine Wren (Natasha Liu Bordizzo, pictured above in an image from the Ahsoka trailer). While she was happy to leave the affairs of Mandalore to Bo-Katan when she gave her the Darksaber, her relationship to her people some ten years later may be something to explore. And if Bo-Katan is trying to reunite everyone who wears a Mando helmet, reaching out to Sabine on Lothal (or wherever she ends up as Ahsoka runs its course) will also be part of any potential ambassadorial duties.\nRead also: Everything We Know About Star Wars Series Ahsoka\n(Photo by Lucasfilm Ltd.)\n• As we suspected, Gideon was attempting to infuse The Force within his next generation Death Troopers and within himself. Although, it is unclear if he meant for that generation to also be the clones of himself Djarin destroyed. Either way, his ambition is yet another shadow of Sheev Palpatine’s (Ian McDiarmid) aims in both the old Extended Universe and the Sequel Trilogy. It will be interesting to see if Thrawn ever comments on it when he finally makes his presence known.\n(Photo by Lucasfilm Ltd.)\n• Djarin’s trip to the New Republic outpost wasn’t just a chance to make arrangements with Carson Teva (Paul Sun-Hyung Lee), but also an opportunity for Filoni and fellow executive producer Rick Famuyiwa to cameo once again as their New Republic ranger characters Trapper Wolf and Jib Dodger. The pair first cameoed in The Mandalorian‘s first season, alongside Obi-Wan Kenobi director Deborah Chow, establishing a tradition of sorts that may eventually lead to Favreau showing his face in an X-Wing pilot jumpsuit. We also suspect Djarin and Carson’s arrangement will follow-up on some of the ideas proposed for the abandoned Rangers of the New Republic series.\nThe photo shows New Republic pilots including Trapper Wolf (Dave Filoni, wearing hat), Captain Carson Teva (Paul Sun-Hyung Lee, in center) with Bartender (Misty Rojas).\n(Photo by Lucasfilm Ltd.)\n• Establishing IG-11 (Taika Waititi) as the marshal of Nevarro and Greef Karga’s (Carl Weathers) land grant to Djarin is about as happy of an ending as could be found for the story threads bound to that planet. Indeed, the iris-out on Grogu at the end of the episode suggests a certain finality for the characters even as new horizons lay ahead for the Clan of Two. We’ll be surprised if Karga or IG-11 have much more to do in subsequent seasons beyond some tactical support, though.\n86% The Mandalorian: Season 3 (2023) is now streaming in its entirety on Disney+.",

            "text": "The Mandalorian Season 3 Episode 8 review: A huge anticlimax\nThe Mandalorian Season 3 Episode 8 is a dire finale; underwhelming, safe to the point of feeling pointless, and opting for cozy fun over any sense of actual drama.\nWe’re at the finish line, so we can say this fairly: The Mandalorian Season 3 is a new low-point for Star Wars’ television empire, feeling more like a big-budget appeasement for Dave Filoni and fans of The Clone Wars and Rebels than a compelling continuation of the story.\nEver since the first episode, there’s been a niggling weightlessness to all of it. We knew Din had to get to Mandalore to be redeemed, and that was cleared up quickly. Bo-Katan quickly emerged as the new de facto lead, with the rest of the season revolving around her legacy with the Darksaber and retaking Mandalore (with the exception of that paint-drying Dr. Pershing chapter).\nEpisode 7 gave us hope: Moff Gideon finally returned, summoning the choir-belting oomph of the Praetorian Guard to finish off the Purge of Mandalore once and for all. It teed up the potential for a thrilling, possibly shocking finale – alas, they may have won, but we lost.\nSpoilers for The Mandalorian to follow…\nThe Mandalorian finale picks up right where we left off\nNo time has passed since Paz Vizsla’s death. We’re back with Bo-Katan and her surviving Mandalorians as they find a way out of the mines. Meanwhile, Axe Woves flies back to the fleet (they’re in the upper atmosphere, but surely their outfits aren’t built for those temperatures) while Din is dragged away by troopers. His feet are limp, but it’s a ruse to get the upper-hand: he breaks one of their necks, and just as he’s about to be blasted in the head, Grogu appears (out of nowhere, we’d add) to save him.\n“I’m gonna need you to be brave for me,” Din tells him, explaining that they have to take out Moff Gideon or he’ll never be stopped. We then get the title card: ‘The Return’ – if you’re waiting on Grand Admiral Thrawn making an appearance, don’t get excited.\nAs interceptors whoosh to the sky to destroy the huge light cruiser in orbit above the planet, Moff vows to “take care of [Din] myself.” He’s a cool villain, boosted massively by Giancarlo Esposito’s scenery-chewing charisma – but as a character, he’s never been able to justify his arrogance. He criticizes the Mandalorians for relying on their trinkets, but he’s the one who crafted a next-gen Dark Trooper suit from their resources. He’s nothing without his toys, without firepower; we need a villain we can respect, not just enjoy as their cape wafts with their swagger.\nDin calls for help from R-5, his anxious droid who assisted him on his first trip to Mandalore in Episode 2. He glides into action, managing to download the Imperial base’s schematics and guiding Din and Grogu to Moff’s station. “This might get messy,” Din warns, and messy it gets. He kills troopers in any and all ways: fire, blasters, stun batons, and knives. Action has never been the show’s weakness, and it’s nice to see it remembering the appeal of its titular hero: a gunslinging bounty hunter who makes light work of anyone who stands in his way.\nDin and Grogu vs Moff and the Praetorian Guard\nMeanwhile, Axe reaches the cruiser and orders everyone on-board to escape in smaller ships. They retreat through the clouds to Mandalore, narrowly avoiding the interceptors as they speed towards the spacecraft. Down below, Bo-Katan, The Armorer, and the others hide out in an underground farm full of greenery, carefully cultivated in the wake of the Great Purge. “Life persists,” one of the survivors says.\nBo-Katan and The Armorer then lead a jetpack dogfight (one shot of the badass pair flying side-by-side, with Bo-Katan wielding the Darksaber, is easily the episode’s strongest image), while Din and Grogu find Moff’s clones. To the shock of nobody, they’re all clones of Moff himself, so Din “smothers them before they could draw their first breath.”\nSubscribe to our newsletter for the latest updates on Esports, Gaming and more.\nWhen they come face to face with Moff, he reveals his clones would have possessed the one thing he doesn’t have: the Force, as he’d isolated the potential to wield it. Din and Moff then duke it out in a crunching, wrathful fight, but with neither man able to overcome the other, he calls on the Praetorian Guard. However, they barely touch Din: Grogu gets their attention, and they follow him into another area while Din and Moff continue their brawl.\nWhile The Armorer bonks troopers left, right, and centre with her hammer, Bo-Katan takes a break to help Din. “Go save your kid,” she says, and he runs off to rescue him from the crimson-clad warriors. Grogu is basically bait for the guards, using the Force to fling their weapons and push them away while Din shoots them. Things do not go so well for Bo-Katan: Moff grabs the Darksaber and crumples it like a can of Coke. Don’t you think it’s great when one of the coolest weapons in the galaxy far, far away, one with eons of mythos, is just destroyed with no immediate repercussions? Remember when Rey and Kylo Ren split the lightsaber in The Last Jedi… those were the days.\nDin, Grogu, and Bo-Katan are saved by Axe, who nosedives the light cruiser into the mine, engulfing it in fire. While Moff is consumed by the swirling inferno, Grogu uses a Force barrier to protect his space daddy and mommy.\nWhen the dust settles on Mandalore, the Great Forge is relit, and Grogu officially becomes Din’s son: Din Grogu. He’s no longer a foundling, now his adopted dad’s apprentice, and they’re free to go off on their own missions. They head to Nevarro, where Din asks Carson Teva for some bounty-hunting work from the New Republic.\nOf course, we get one last reunion with Greef Karga on Nevarro, who gifts Din a cabin for him and his “new family” to live in “between adventures”, while a rebooted, repaired IG-11 will serve as the city’s marshall. The episode ends on a peaceful sight: Din with his feet up, while Grogu plays with a frog.\nWe’re not saying we wanted Grogu to die – nobody wants that – but there were no surprises whatsoever; no watercooler moments, no payoffs, nothing to be excited for or scared of going forward (yes, Thrawn is coming… in another show). Some may feel emotional over Din officially adopting Grogu, but why? We’ve been calling them a father-son duo for years now, and everyone around them refers to Grogu as his kid. Maybe we’re just over it – the show seems content on being the equivalent of a soft blanket, and that’s not enough for us.\nThe Mandalorian Season 3 Episode 8 review: 2/5\nIt’s not that The Mandalorian Season 3 Episode 8 is outright bad, but it’s the most boring version of any finale we could have had. There’s no ambition to this storytelling, instead feeling like the last step of an elongated series reset for Grogu and his dad. We wanted more.\nThe Mandalorian Season 3 Episode 8 is available to stream on Disney+ now.

            "text": "Supported by\n‘The Mandalorian’ Season Finale Recap: A Sort of Homecoming\nThis week’s finale brought a thrilling end to a season that has often felt slipshod in its conception.\nSeason 3, Episode 8: ‘The Return’\nThe first two seasons of “The Mandalorian” were a model of narrative efficiency. In Season 1, Din Djarin tried to protect Grogu from the multiple individuals and institutions that wanted to capture the little guy. In Season 2, Djarin tried to reunite Grogu with the Jedi. In both seasons, the stories were mission-based, and those missions were broken down into smaller tasks that fit neatly into tightly plotted, action-packed 30 to 40-minute episodes. That’s what made “The Mandalorian” great.\nThis week’s Season 3 finale is also tightly plotted and action-packed; and it features some of the most impressive aerial fight scenes in the “Star Wars” franchise’s history. But the episode arrives at the end of a season that never seemed to settle on a single unifying theme or goal that would give its story a shape.\nEssentially, three threads wove through this season. The central one involved the larger story of the Mandalorians themselves, who overcame centuries of class conflict and religious squabbles and united in an effort to restore their desolate home planet to its former glory. The other two threads involved obstacles to the Mandalorians’ plan: the overwhelmed and inattentive New Republic bureaucracy and the Imperial remnant forces commanded by the fugitive Moff Gideon.\nTo its credit, the finale does bring all these threads together. The season culminates in a big battle on Mandalore between Gideon’s stormtrooper army and hundreds of angry Mandalorians — after which the victorious heroes begin resettling their planet, as Djarin and Grogu launch an off-the-books business helping the New Republic bring order to the Outer Rim. All’s well that ends well.\nAnd to be clear, this finale does end Season 3 well. Picking up where last week’s cliffhanger left off, the episode begins with Djarin escaping his stormtrooper captors with the help of some cool spinning kicks and the timely arrival of Grogu — still in his IG-12 attack armor, and still smashing the “No. No. No.” button. The pair then go after Gideon, which requires them to pass through multiple deflector shields, guarded by troopers with increasingly more powerful weaponry. (It’s like they have to beat harder and harder video game levels.)\nThey get past the shields with the help of R5-D4 in a sequence that comes as close to comic relief as this otherwise intense episode gets. The ever-reluctant droid jets down to the Imperial base — which like all Imperial bases in “Star Wars” consists of narrow walkways perched at life-threatening heights for some reason. Though it physically trembles with nerves, R5-D4 is able to plug into the computers and send Djarin some schematics, all while shooing away pesky little mouse droids.\nWhen Djarin and Grogu reach Gideon — after destroying a chamber full of his clones — the aspiring emperor boasts about his scheme to acquire mastery of the Force through science, and then he commands his Praetorian Guards to attack Djarin. An angry Grogu presses his “No” button repeatedly, but soon the Guards force him awkwardly back through a closing door into another room, while his Mandalorian protector watches helplessly from the ground.\nWhile all of this is going on, the Mandalorians come swarming down in their jetpacks and engage in hand-to-hand combat with flying stormtroopers. This is thrilling stuff, well-handled by the director Rick Famuyiwa and the effects team, who keep the action clear and dynamic while also making it look like a proper melee. The clash resolves when Bo-Katan reaches Djarin and Grogu and lends her Darksaber to the fight against Gideon, right before Axe Woves crashes the privateers’ light cruiser into the base. (Grogu gets all tuckered out protecting his friends with a Force bubble.)\nWith the Mandalorians and the Imperial remnant at each other’s armored throats from the moment this episode begins, there is not much time for quiet reflection, though the writer (and the show’s creator) Jon Favreau does let the good guys rest for a couple of minutes in a cave. There, the Mandalorians who never left the home world tell Bo-Katan about how they were able to cultivate plants indigenous to Mandalore, which had not grown naturally for centuries because of the planet’s civil wars and overreliance on industrialization. This little factoid counters something Gideon says later while he’s destroying Bo-Katan’s Darksaber, that, “Mandalorians are weak once they lose their trinkets.” Apparently, according to the ones who survived the Purge, even Mandalorians without cutting-edge tech at their disposal can find a Way.\nThese seeds of hope for Mandalore bear fruit in the episode’s first epilogue, where after Gideon’s defeat the Armorer relights the Great Forge and then recommences the process of anointing foundlings in the Living Waters. Djarin asks for Grogu to go through the ritual, but because the child cannot speak and has no parents to vouch for him, the Armorer hesitates. So Djarin formally adopts his ward, now given the name Din Grogu.\nTo be honest, what is most exciting about this ending is that it sets up a Season 4 that might bring “The Mandalorian” back to basics. (The episode’s title, “The Return,” could have two meanings.) There is still plenty to like about this series. The action sequences are outstanding and the characters are good company. But compared to the stellar first two seasons, Season 3 often felt slipshod, as though Favreau and company rushed episodes to air without sanding off their rougher edges — perhaps relying too much on “hey this show is supposed to be kind of corny” as an excuse.\nThere is a lot of promise though in the finale’s second epilogue, which sees the two Dins back on Nevarro, living in a little cabin by a pond, where Grogu can levitate frogs all day while Djarin waits for his next assignment — just like something out of an old TV western. Perhaps this Mandalorian can print up some business cards: “Have Beskar, will travel.”\nThis is the way\nA nifty detail: Gideon’s voice through his helmet has a bit of a Darth Vader growl.\nAnother: During the standoff between Djarin and Gideon, off in the distance we can see the aerial battles raging.\nI wrote earlier this season about how enjoying “The Mandalorian” requires some willingness to ignore the goofy physics of the Grogu puppet, toddling about and flipping through the air. This episode’s highly kinetic fight scenes undoubtedly tested the patience of those who roll their eyes every time Baby Yoda jumps around. It still works for me though, as someone who grew up watching Hong Kong martial arts movies, Japanese monster films and Sid and Marty Krofft’s psychedelic TV shows. To quote Obi-Wan Kenobi: Many of the truths we cling to depend greatly on our own point of view.",

            "text": "Just when you think Disney cannot heap any more indignity upon Star Wars, Mickey Mouse and his minions find a way. Disney’s mission to extract maximum value from the venerable sci-fi franchise began with a trilogy of ever-direr movies, where lore-breaking storylines battled with dialogue so dreadful – “they fly now?” – that it didn’t disturb the force so much as make it consider early retirement.\nEven worse was last year’s Obi-Wan Kenobi spin-off, for which Ewan McGregor dusted down his 20-years-old Alec Guinness impersonation to little avail. Amid all that Jedi dross, The Mandalorian stood out as a rare beacon of joy. There wasn’t much to the tale of an armour-encased bounty hunter (Pedro Pascal, assisted by stunt-doubles) and his adorable side-kick Grogu, aka Baby Yoda. That was the point. Here was a reminder that the simplest pleasures – a tin-plated mercenary and his green blob sidekick having adventures, say – can be the most rewarding.\nBut the gloss has gone off the show with its third season and a spirited and spectacle-filled finale isn’t enough to restore Mando’s mojo. There’s lots of action and the script belatedly gives Grogu something to do beyond hopping around radiating cuteness. Alas, it’s too little, too late.\nGrogu and Mando have been all at sea as they bounded about the galaxy over the past several weeks. One minute they were fighting space pirates. The next our shiny hero was diving pointlessly into the monster-filled waters of his home world.\nRock bottom was achieved when Jack Black and the pop star Lizzo turned up for a mind-bending double cameo as the eccentric rulers of a planet overrun by crazy droids. Forget about chewing the scenery. Black and Lizzo licked it as if sampling banana-flavoured wallpaper.\nThat was when they weren’t delivering fruity gags that felt 30 years past their sell-by-date. For reasons best known to Disney, a Carry-On… movie had been parachuted into the Galaxy Far Far Away. You half expected a CGI-generated Sid James to wander through wielding a lightsaber.\nThose traumatising memories will remain with Star Wars fans for some time. And the final instalment doesn’t come near to banishing them. Still, it’s enjoyably pacey and crammed with action. In the circumstances, that is perhaps the best that could be hoped for.\nDin Djarin – as Mando’s mum called him – and his ally Bo-Katan (Katee Sackhoff ) have led the Mandalorian tribe back to their home world. Awkwardly, the planet has already been colonised by Imperial restorationist Moth Gideon (Breaking Bad’s Giancarlo Esposito).\nStar Wars has set up Gideon as Din Djarin’s ultimate nemesis. However, he has only ever turned up at the end of each series of The Mandalorian – an emergency brake for whenever the show runs out of storyline. And so his apparent demise at the conclusion of the episode carries little weight (and that’s assuming Disney has definitively killed him off).\nNor is there any tension in Grogu’s face-off with the Praetorian guard (Stormtroopers wrapped in shiny red vinyl). Whatever you think about the disposable Moff Gideon, it’s unthinkable Star Wars would dispatch its unofficial mascot. You never believe he’s in jeopardy.\nThe Mandalorian’s return has been a miss with audiences, with viewership slumping by 50 per cent. That isn’t to say all hope is lost. Tony Gilroy’s gritty Andor showed that, even under the thumb of Mickey Mouse, Star Wars can be a conduit for gripping TV.\nWith a fourth series confirmed, it isn’t unthinkable that The Mandalorian can rocket-boost its way back to old glories. The finale ends with Din formally adopting Grogu as a trainee bounty hunter. Their next mission will be to scour the galaxy for Imperial holdouts similar to Gideon.\nAfter this year’s murky muddle, the hope must be that Mando returns to basics and that the jewel in the Star Wars crown gets its shimmer back.",

            "text": "Warning: This review contains spoilers for The Mandalorian’s season 3 finale.\nThe last time The Mandalorian dropped a season finale, fans were blown away by a surprise appearance by Luke Skywalker and a radical change to the status quo. The final episode of season 3 doesn’t quite live up to that Mandalorian milestone, but it is an action-packed conclusion to this leg of the journey. “Chapter 24: The Return” picks up right where last week’s episode left off, with Bo-Katan leading the Mandalorians into battle against the Imperial Remnants while Mando is taken into Moff Gideon’s custody.\nThe climactic action of “The Return” follows the standard Star Wars formula for a final battle as it cross-cuts between a handful of different perspectives of the same skirmish: Bo-Katan takes on Moff Gideon, Mando and Grogu take on a band of merry Praetorian Guards, the other Mandalorians take on the new generation of Dark Troopers, and Axe kamikazes the Mandalorian mothership into the Imperial Remnants’ base. In the hands of director Rick Famuyiwa, this finale episode isn’t just a half-hour of mindless spectacle. Famuyiwa never loses sight of the emotions behind the combat, like Bo-Katan’s grudge against Gideon and Mando’s paternal protectiveness of Grogu.\nIt’s always fun to see Mando using his wide array of gadgets, from his flamethrower to his rocket launcher, but they are essentially cheat codes to get him through the show’s action sequences unscathed. In “The Return,” it’s interesting to see Mando having to fight without the convenience of his arsenal – much like when Tony Stark infiltrated the Mandarin’s compound without the use of his armor in Iron Man 3 – as he makes his way through several waves of Dark Troopers guarding Gideon’s tower. This sequence also creates suspense masterfully as Mando relies on R5-D4 to remotely open the shield doors and R5 is interrupted by a meddling mouse droid while Mando is desperately fighting for his life.\nThe episode builds to a jaw-dropping climax as Axe crashes the Mandalorians’ light cruiser into Gideon’s base and Grogu creates a Force bubble to protect his surrogate mother and father from the fiery explosion that follows. This will surely go down as a classic Mandalorian moment. Not only is it an eye-popping image; it’s also the culmination of the season’s character arcs. The usually closed-off Bo-Katan has been gradually warming up to Mando and Grogu and ingratiating herself as the mom in their dysfunctional “found family” dynamic. Grogu using his immense Force powers to protect his parents is the heartwarming emotional peak of that storyline.\nGideon’s “death” is somewhat underwhelming. But he’s almost certainly not dead. He was wearing a suit of near-indestructible beskar alloy, and while he was consumed by flames, he didn’t technically die on-screen. The rule of thumb for character deaths in sci-fi and fantasy stories is that if there’s no body, there’s no death. If Gideon really is dead and Giancarlo Esposito isn’t coming back in season 4, then his ending in the season 3 finale will be remembered as a disappointment. But it didn’t seem like an official demise. It felt more like The Mandalorian’s third-season finale was faced with a Quantumania problem. Series creator Jon Favreau was caught between a rock and a hard place, wanting to keep Gideon around for future storylines while also providing a definitive conclusion to the conflicts of season 3.\nWhereas the season 2 finale ended right after the action when Luke took Grogu away to be trained, the season 3 finale has a Return of the King-style epilogue with some exciting setups for season 4. After the season opened with a foundling’s initiation ceremony, it felt like a nice full-circle moment to end the season on another foundling’s initiation ceremony. The Armorer has reignited the Great Forge on Mandalore. Mando has officially adopted Grogu as his son and taken him under his wing as an apprentice. They’ve retired to a little house on the prairie and accepted jobs as independent contractors policing the Outer Rim for the New Republic. After spending its third season as the Bo-Katan show, detailing how the Mandalorians have reclaimed their homeworld, The Mandalorian will resume its original premise as an adventure-of-the-week serial about a bounty hunter and his baby traveling the galaxy in search of bad guys to bring to justice.\nThe season 3 finale of The Mandalorian offers up all the action and spectacle that Star Wars fans could want. Bo-Katan and her backup retake Mandalore in a glorious battle royale that demolishes Gideon’s fleet (even if it seems like the defeat of Gideon himself won’t be permanent). It’s not quite as mind-blowing as it was to see Luke slice and dice his way through a platoon of robotic Dark Troopers in the last season finale, but Mando and Grogu’s team-up gives audiences a tantalizing glimpse of the side-by-side butt-kicking they’ll be doing for the New Republic when the series returns.",

            "text": "The Mandalorian season 3 finale review: The Return\n“Mandalorians are stronger together.” Spoilers for The Mandalorian season 3, episode 8 follow.\nAfter discovering that the Mandalorian homeworld has been overrun by Imperials, the fight to reclaim their planet begins. Meanwhile, Din makes his way to take out Moff Gideon once and for all.\nThe season 3 finale of The Mandalorian brings a fitting close to what’s been another amazing season while leading perfectly into season 4.\nThe Mandalorian season 3 finale recap: Taking back Mandalore\nAfter being ambushed by the Imperials, Bo-Katan and her Mandalorians retreat in order to wait for reinforcements before attacking once again. Axe manages to make his way back to the capital ship, thus sending every Mandalorian down to the surface to help Bo-Katan, while he takes over the capital ship as a decoy. This is a fantastic, tension-riddled scene as we’re scared that he’s not going to make it, but then that tension switches to thinking that he’s a traitor. But when it’s clear that he’s not, that tension then switches back again to fearing that Axe will die. It’s such a great sequence that keeps you on your toes throughout the entirety of it.\nBut once the reinforcements that Axe sends down to the surface arrive, a fantastic battle scene between the Mandalorians and Imperials. It’s intense, well-paced, and well-choreographed in a way that is often difficult for battle scenes in a 360-degree space, unlike the 180-degree space where regular ground battles take place. Yet, Rick Famuyima does a great job of handling this scene, making it look chaotic, but comprehensible.\nBut the real joy of this scene comes from the full circle of Bo-Katan’s arc of being a villain in Death Watch during The Clone Wars to now taking back Mandalore, Darksaber in hand, which is incredible. This character has gone through such a great redemption and to finally see her at her absolute best after over a decade of watching this character on screen is wonderful.\nThe Mandalorian season 3 finale recap: Infiltration\nAs for our singular Mandalorian though, he manages to escape from the squad of Stormtroopers with the help of Grogu and immediately begins to make his way to Moff Gideon. This sequence feels like a video game level after video game level with increasing difficulties corresponding to each new scene, which is great.\nSequences like this are always, but sometimes, they simply don’t just come out well. However, that is very much not the case here. This is a tense, exciting sequence where it actually feels like Din is in danger, even if he definitely isn’t yet. You know the director, writers, and editors have succeeded when you feel that your main character is in danger, even if there is no way storywise that they will die at this point.\nBut finally, after Din destroys the Gideon clones that have been on the back-burner since the literal first episode of the series, Din and Gideon begin to fight for the last time. Yet again, it’s a great fight that goes through several phases. And, basically, everything that’s been said about the other fight scenes in this episode can once again be said about this too.\nThe Mandalorian season 3 finale recap: Queen vs. Dictator\nAs Din is losing to Gideon though, Bo-Katan saves Din so that he can help Grogu, who is also fighting for his life. And this is where we get to the culmination of Bo-Katan’s arc. As she then fights Gideon, he destroys the Darksaber thus, theoretically, taking everything away from her. But, after Axe crashes the destroyed Capital ship into the Imperial base, thus also killing Gideon, we also see that the Mandalorians have moved beyond their need for a trinket like the Darksaber to determine their leader.\nAs Bo-Katan reignites the Great Forge, it’s clear that the Mandalorians stand behind her as they continue to move forward into the rebuilding of Mandalore, bringing her arc full circle.\nThe Mandalorian’s season 3 finale, to put it bluntly, is a perfect ending to an overall fantastic season.",

            "text": "The Mandalorian Season 3 Finale Review: A Disappointing Conclusion To A Lackluster Season\nAfter \"Andor,\" one of the most creatively exciting projects in the entire \"Star Wars\" canon, fans hoped that Season 3 of \"The Mandalorian\" would bring more high-quality entertainment to the franchise. The results, however, have been almost uniformly underwhelming. A messy season-long Mandalore arc fails to capitalize on the one thing that drew fans to the show in the first place: The relationship between Mando and Grogu. Season 3's finale remedies that, at least, keeping the characters close together in a series of impactful scenes. But while the episode is action-packed, it never becomes genuinely exciting to watch, and does little to avoid the feeling that \"The Mandalorian\" has run out of ideas.\nWe meet our heroes in the midst of the Battle for Mandalore. The Mandalorians are facing off against a troop of jet pack-equipped stormtroopers, while Mando and Grogu (equipped with his new IG-88 exoskeleton) make their way through Moff Gideon's forces. Along the way, they discover — and subsequently destroy — an entire room full of Moff Gideon clones, marinating in goo. We learn that his master plan is to create an army of clones with enhanced Force sensitivity, which would make them nigh-unbeatable in combat. Amidst this fight, Bo-Katan Kryze's arc gets some semblance of resolution as she joins the battle against Moff Gideon. This is a familiar conflict between the two, as they grapple for control of the legendary Darksaber, a weapon that is eventually destroyed — although whether it will stay gone is another story entirely.\nA lack of exciting visuals\nThere's a lot happening in the Season 3 finale of \"The Mandalorian\" — so much so that it often becomes muddled. What should be a thrilling battle between Mandalorians and stormtroopers ends up as a bunch of white and gray blurs flying around like bees. There's little visual interest to be found, because the entire show is infected with such a debilitating sense of same-y-ness. The stormtroopers and the Mandalorians look the same, and our key battles are between two fighters who just so happen to be wearing Beskar armor in slightly different shades. As an individual, Mando's face mask adds to his sense of mystery. But when almost every single person on the show is masked, spewing stilted dialogue, all it creates is monotony.\nIt's also disappointing that we've spent an entire season with the extremist Mandalorian cult and there has seemingly been little attempt to move the plot forward. At one point, it feels as though the show is building toward a rift between the group and Mando, with him becoming disillusioned and needing to forge a path for himself. But now, it seems like they've just reverted to the status quo, even deepening ties with the group by having Grogu officially become a Mandalorian apprentice. If the show's makers are planning on this break being where \"The Mandalorian\" ultimately goes — which they've arguably laid quite a bit of groundwork for — they may need to get started on that.\nIs The Mandalorian stuck?\nIt's telling that \"The Mandalorian\" has only had three fairly short seasons and is already rehashing previous storylines. Bo-Katan's reclamation of power in the Mandalorian community is the same arc she's had multiple times over in the \"Star Wars\" canon; it just seems to be constantly restarted, ad nauseum. Bringing back Moff Gideon feels tired — he's not a memorable villain who audiences were necessarily clamoring for, and it's clear that the writers don't know what to do with him. If his only purpose is to wallpaper over a certain much-maligned cloning plotline from \"Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker,\" well ... that's not great. Mando and Grogu — now more formally father and son — are poised to take on adventure-of-the-week storylines in the future. But this is also more or less where they started when the show began. These narrative choices are all hallmarks of a show that doesn't know where to go from here.\nWhen \"The Mandalorian\" began, it won over audiences on the strength of the dynamic between Mando and his pint-sized companion. But three seasons later, it doesn't seem as though they've really put the work into figuring out what else the show should be about. \"The Mandalorian\" has been a show filled with storylines that play out like side quests in a video game, where characters say things like, \"I'll help you kill the Kalwar monster, but first you have to get me this one tool I need.\" This has resulted in a somewhat uneven show – but it also means that when it's good, it's really good. With this season, however, \"The Mandalorian\" has embraced a more arc-driven narrative. The issue here is that it's not clear if the show has enough substance to support such an approach. The season finale makes this an especially pressing issue. It's an episode that should be filled with excitement and thrilling action, but because there's no underlying emotional resonance or heft to the narrative, it falls disappointingly flat.",

            "text": "The Mandalorian season 3 finale has been released, and the series is again one of the most popular on Disney+. To be honest, I’m not shocked by this. The last few years have shown that Star Wars projects are consistently popular on streaming. Many people enjoy watching The Mandalorian with their families, and that’s what makes the experience better.\nEven I do it, and it’s a really nice feeling to know that it’s another Wednesday and it’s time to chill together with parents, siblings, etc. watching Mando and just having fun. With the release of the season 3 finale of The Mandalorian, let’s quickly recap the entire season and talk about final thoughts on the series so far.\n[Warning: Spoilers from The Mandalorian season 3 and the finale are below!]\nSeason 3 tells a very different story from previous seasons\nThe first two seasons of The Mandalorian were really fun to watch. There were serious moments, of course, but many episodes were well-written stories that you could dive into and explore. There were many filler episodes, but they always had something to offer. It was great for an entertaining story, great characters or fast-paced action without having to mix it up with Mando’s (Pedro Pascal) main mission: to find Grogu’s people.\nIf you have watched The Book of Boba Fett then you know that Grogu left Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) to reunite with Din. But in season 3 of The Mandalorian, they seemed to focus on Din and Grogu’s relationship less, because of the Mandalore arc. That being said, this was a really good decision.\nMandalore is a very important world in Star Wars lore. Whenever it’s mentioned or shown, people know it’s a big deal. The same is true of this series. We don’t know much about what happened between Star Wars: Return of the Jedi and Star Wars: The Force Awakens. Mando really fills in those gaps.\nAfter a really great premiere episode of season 3, we learned that Din wants to help the Mandalorians reclaim their world. To do so, he must bathe in the Living Waters of Mandalore. But, was “redeeming” himself in these waters really worth it, especially everything that happened afterward?\nDin Djarin & Bo-Katan work to reunite the Mandalorians and get back their home world\nOne of the highlights has been the redemption of Din Djarin in the eyes of his fellow Mandalorians. Once the helmet was removed, according to this faction of their religion, he could no longer follow their Way. Fortunately, Bo-Katan (Katee Sackhoff) helped him find the Living Waters of Mandalore. Thanks to this and the discovery that the legendary Mythosaur is real, she too began to follow the Way and joined other Mandalorians.\nShe and Din worked together to help the people. One of their missions was to help the people of Nevarro when the pirate Gorian Shard (Nonso Anozie) attacked the city of High Magistrate Greef Karga (Carl Weathers). As we later learned, this was all Moff Gideon’s (Giancarlo Esposito) plan to weaken neutral systems. It was a good mission that allowed a group of Mandalorians led by The Armorer (Emily Swallow) to accept Din Djarin and Bo-Katan in their group for good.\nThanks to Greef Karga’s generous offer, every Mandalorian there got his own piece of land and a new home. But they then decided that it’s finally time to reclaim Mandalore and restore its splendor. To do so, The Armorer said that Bo-Katan is their leader because she walks both worlds (Mandalorians who wear helmets all the time, and those who don’t). Now all she and Din have to do is gather other Mandalorians, including Koska Reeves (Mercedes Varnado), Axe Woves (Simon Kassianides), and others.\nAfter this great “reunion” of the Mandalorians, everyone decides that reclaiming Mandalore was now or never. They all go there, but none of them expected what they find there.\nThe Mandalorian season 3 finale was a little disappointing\nWhen the Mandalorians arrive on Mandalore, they learn that there are still some survivors of The Night of a Thousand Tears. They lead our group of heroes to the Great Forge of Mandalore, where armor was forged in the old days. However, one big surprise awaits them there – Stormtroopers in Beskar armor. Moff Gideon has built his new army to be strong, agile, and almost invincible – much like Mandalorians. They have the same weapons and even jetpacks. After defeating these Stormtroopers, it comes to light that Gideon has also built a special armor for himself. He kidnaps Din and gives orders to kill the others.\nThanks to Paz Vizsla (Tait Fletcher), who stayed and helped them escape, they make an escape. Unfortunately, during a battle with Praetorian guards, Vizsla is killed. It was a really sad thing to watch. I had great sympathy for him, from the first moment he decided to support Din.\nWith the grand finale split into two episodes, The Mandalorian season 3 finale had to live up to fans’ expectations. The most important thing was to have an effective closure of each story arc, which was relevant to the entire main plot of the season, which is more or less what we got. There’s a big battle between the Mandalorian army and the Stormtroopers, reminiscent of the Mandalorian Civil Wars. In the end, Din and Bo-Katan, along with Grogu, fight Gideon.\nThankfully, tho not surprisingly, our heroes survive, and Din finally officially adopted Grogu as his son, naming him Din Grogu. The last scene we see is Din living with Grogu on Nevarro, along with Karga and the rebuilt IG-11 (Taika Waititi), who is now a Marshal.\nFinal thoughts on The Mandalorian season 3\nAs a whole, season 3 was a really nice piece of adventure storytelling. We were able to see different worlds, learn about new cultures, and see new monsters. Basically, it was everything you would expect from Star Wars.\nBut the finale was a combination of too fast and too short. What I expected was to learn more about the Gideon clones that were in these tubes and about the grand plan called “Project Necromancer.” Instead, we got a huge ending that should’ve been kept for the series finale, and it wasn’t all that good. But I’m hoping that by the time we get a Dave Filoni film that wraps up the Mandoverse, there will be some more clarification about certain things.\nThis season was, in my opinion, better than season 2 and almost as good as season 1. After the season 3 finale, I doubt there will be a major story arc in a forth season unless Moff Gideon somehow returns.\nThe Mandalorian is available to stream on Disney+.

            "text": "Ricky Church reviews the season 3 finale of The Mandalorian….\nSeason three of The Mandalorian has now ended with an action-packed episode as the combined Mandalorian forces fought against Moff Gideon and his new Dark Troopers for control of Mandalore. It was a suspenseful finale with plenty of moments to wow the audience during the numerous fight sequences, though ‘The Return’ lacked some of the emotion and character moments the show has been known for and rushed through its final few minutes before story beats or plotlines could be fully tied up.\nNo time was wasted at the start of the episode as it picked up right where it left off with Bo-Katan and her group of Mandalorians attempting to escape Gideon’s facility while Din Djarin was being led away. Din’s fight against his Dark Trooper captors was well choreographed, providing yet another example of how skilled he is in combat even without a weapon. The timely arrival of Grogu was nice though it is unclear how he managed to break away from Bo-Katan’s group without her or anyone else mentioning it, causing his appearance to be a little jarring and leaving one to question how he tracked Din and the Dark Troopers.\nThe same can be said for how Gideon was somehow tracking Din and Grogu through his facility so precisely with the pair even appearing as their own distinct dots on the monitor. It’s the sort of plot convenience that is merely handwaved away, yet begs the question of how Gideon could have been surprised by Din destroying his cloning tanks if he could follow him so effortlessly to begin with? It shows that Dave Filoni, Jon Favreau and director Rick Famuyiwa were more concerned with delivering action spectacle than a completely coherent plot.\nThat said, the action was pretty spectacular throughout the finale. There was a traditional Star Wars element in this where the climax was made up of several different battles happening concurrently and converging in meaningful ways, much like in Return of the Jedi or The Phantom Menace. From the aerial battle, Axel trying to take down TIE Fighters with their ship and Din’s fight through the complex, each part of the battle for Mandalore was well done and timed to the growing pressure the characters faced. The aerial battle between the Mandalorians and Dark Troopers was particularly impressive with its choreography and action. Bo-Katan and the Armorer slicing through troopers with their respective melee weapons, rockets being fired into troopers or Koska utilizing her knee rockets and jetpack in a combo move were some of the highlights of their battle.\nThat’s without mentioning the ground fight as Din fought through the ray shielded bridge or Gideon and his Praetorian guards in well choreographed sequences, some of which were rather graphic for Star Wars as Din stabbed his enemies in their throats or shot them point blank in the heads (all bloodless of course since this is still Star Wars). From an action and technical standpoint, ‘The Return’ more than delivered on that front.\nHowever, for all the action present there was a clear lack of character moments. This is even more noticeable when compared with the previous episode as Bo-Katan relayed the story of Mandalore’s defeat or Din swearing his allegiance to her. The quietest part which allowed the characters to momentarily breathe and collect themselves was Bo-Katan’s discovery plant life has been slowly returning to Mandalore, but rather than sit there in that scene have her reflect on life’s persistence or examine her resolve more deeply, her reinforcements quickly arrived and they were immediately off again charging into battle. Even the end sequences rushed through some of the character moments as there was no reflection for Bo-Katan on freeing Mandalore or even a crowning ceremony for her or what the loss of the Darksaber means for Bo-Katan and Mandalore’s culture.\nThere wasn’t even a memorial of any kind for Paz Viszla after his sacrifice last week, even when his son was properly initiated into the Children of the Watch. The closing minutes breezed by their victory very quickly just to set up Din and Grogu together on Nevarro and an off-the-books job to hunt down Imperials for the New Republic – a fact that seems rather counterintuitive to Din’s claim he is going to be more selective with his bounties now that Grogu is formally his adopted son since hunting Imperials seems more dangerous than typical criminals.\nEven the few character moments we did get were good though thanks to the performances from the cast. Katee Sackhoff delivered a great performance which displayed Bo’s ferocious fury and determination in her fight with Gideon while Giancarlo Esposito again showcased Gideon’s menace and arrogance. Pedro Pascal’s line delivery as Din conveyed the emotional connection to Grogu and how much Din considered the two of them a team as he didn’t fight back against Grogu’s desire to help during some of the fights. A few longstanding question were answered as well, such as what exactly Gideon was working on with Grogu’s blood and cloning, revealing himself to be so arrogant that he believed clones of himself infused with the Force would be the Empire’s greatest soldier.\nHowever, other plot threads were either left wide open or not satisfyingly wrapped up, such as the aforementioned future of Mandalore or, surprisingly, the coming return of Grand Admiral Thrawn in Ahsoka, though it is actually nice to have the finale focused more on the Mandalorians than planting further seeds for a whole other series. Not to mention if this truly is the end of Gideon since he could have more clones of himself waiting in the wings.\n‘The Return’ delivered a lot of great action with Famuyiwa giving each sequence its own distinctive feel alongside excellent choreography, but the lack of character moments was very felt throughout the finale. Pascal, Sackhoff and Esposito all shined in their performances, but they weren’t enough to make up for how little actual emotion or development there was as the few quieter scenes were rushed through to make way for the action and a fine, if untidy, wrap up.\nRating: 7/10\nRicky Church – Follow me on Twitter for more movie news and nerd talk.",

            "text": "The Mandalorian season 3 finale explained\n- TV Show\nWarning: This article contains spoilers for The Mandalorian chapter 24: \"The Return.\"\nDin Djarin and Grogu finally found their happy ending in the Mandalorian season 3 finale.\nAll season long, Pedro Pascal's beskar-clad bounty hunter and his tiny green companion have jumped from one threat to another, facing off against bloodthirsty pirates, creepy cyborgs, and even Christopher Lloyd. But after eight episodes of danger, Din Djarin and Grogu ended the season with a rare moment of peace — and hope for the future.\nThe season 3 finale picks up in the middle of the battle for Mandalore, as Bo-Katan Kryze (Katee Sackhoff) leads her people in a fight against Moff Gideon (Giancarlo Esposito) and his Imperial troopers. It's a brutal, action-packed sequence, as Bo rallies her fellow Mandalorians and Din tries to escape from Gideon's clutches. Ultimately, Grogu helps rescue his mentor, and together, the two set out to find and kill Gideon once and for all.\nAs they're searching for Gideon, Din and Grogu stumble upon a sinister science lab, where they discover what Gideon's been up to. Thanks to new technology developed by Dr. Pershing (Omid Abtahi), Gideon has been cloning himself, hoping to create a Force-sensitive army in his own image. Din quickly destroys the lab (and the clones), but it's a reminder that the Empire's cloning experiments didn't end on Kamino — and will eventually lead to Palpatine's resurrection in The Rise of Skywalker.\nEventually, Gideon and his Praetorian guards find Din and Grogu, and a brutal battle ensues. Bo-Katan ultimately arrives to help, but even with the Darksaber, Gideon is too powerful. At one point, Gideon rips the Darksaber out of Bo-Katan's hand, crushing it in his fist and rendering the weapon useless. But ultimately, Gideon is outnumbered, and together, Bo, Din, and Grogu team up to help overpower him. As a Mandalorian ship crashes into the base, Gideon apparently dies in the fiery wreckage. Bo and Din assume that they're done for, too — until Grogu uses the Force to protect them from the flames.\nIt certainly seems like the end of Gideon — but remember, this is Star Wars, so even if a character dies on screen, that doesn't necessarily mean they're gone forever. (After all, other characters gotten been in a sarlacc pit or exploded in the belly of the Death Star and somehow survived.) It remains to be seen whether Gideon will survive this explosion — or whether there might be Gideon clones running around the galaxy.\nStill, Gideon's defeat calls for celebration. Even without the Darksaber, Bo-Katan takes her place as the official ruler of Mandalore, guiding her people and helping to relight the Great Forge. Meanwhile, Din takes Grogu to the Living Waters, where he tells the Armorer (Emily Swallow) that he wants to take Grogu on as his official apprentice. The Armorer explains that Grogu is too young to speak the Creed, and besides, he would need the approval of his parents.\nSo, Din makes things official, adopting Grogu as his son. From here on out, Grogu will be known as \"Din Grogu,\" and together, father and son will start a new family business, taking odd jobs for the New Republic and helping protect the Outer Rim. They even have a small cabin on the outskirts of Nevarro, where baby Grogu — excuse me, Din Grogu — can levitate all the frogs he wants.\nAnd that's it! Unlike previous seasons of The Mandalorian, there's no mid-credits or post-credits scene to tease Din and Grogu's future adventures. (Can we still call them Din and Grogu? Or are they now technically Din and Din now?) Season 4 of The Mandalorian has yet to be announced, but co-creator Jon Favreau previously said that he and Dave Filoni have already written the scripts. Favreau also told EW that he and Filoni have no plans to wrap up the show, and they'll continue making it as long as they can.\n\"I don't know what would make me not enjoy doing it, especially as long as the audience is connecting with these characters,\" Favreau told EW. \"This feels like a really enjoyable moment. And I love this format of telling one chapter at a time and keeping the audience guessing, but also fulfilling certain expectations.\"\nFor more on The Mandalorian and all things Star Wars, listen to EW's Dagobah Dispatch podcast — featuring a full breakdown of every Mandalorian episode and interviews with cast members Pedro Pascal, Katee Sackhoff, and more.\nRelated Content\n- Giancarlo Esposito warns of Moff Gideon's Mandalorian return\n- The Star Wars crawl is coming back, says Kathleen Kennedy\n- Katy O'Brian thought her Mandalorian character was dead\n- Jar Jar Binks actor Ahmed Best returns as a Jedi on The Mandalorian\n- Here's why Katee Sackhoff kept that big secret on The Mandalorian\n- Jon Favreau addresses how many seasons The Mandalorian will run\n- The Mandalorian adds three wild celebrity cameos\nEpisode Recaps\nThe live-action Star Wars series follows a lone Mandalorian gunfighter in the outer reaches of the galaxy.\n|type|| |\n|seasons|| |\n|rating|\n|genre|\n|creator|\n|network|",

            "text": "The Mandalorian Season 3 Finale Review & Recap By Melody McCune The Mandalorian™ is back with an action-packed and satisfying season finale. While it’s not quite as shocking and jaw-dropping as its predecessor, “Chapter 24: The Return” delivers a happy ending for our heroes. There’s something beautiful in its simplicity and directness, too. It could serve as a series finale if we didn’t already know Jon Favreau and his team want to make more seasons. “Chapter 24: The Return” ties up loose ends more than it creates new threads, but there’s story potential for future seasons. Perhaps we’ll see Din and Grogu™ embark on new adventures when the former trains the latter as his apprentice. Maybe we’ll get domestic hijinks on Nevarro™. Bo-Katan Kryze™ and the Mandalorians™ rebuilding Mandalore™. Who knows? I would love to see more of Din Djarin™ and Din Grogu™. That’s all I know. Bringing in More Forces We open with Bo-Katan contacting Axe Woves™, who’s still flying to the Mandalorian fleet orbiting Mandalore. She asks him to evacuate everyone and use the capital ship as a decoy. Their best chance of success is to defeat Moff Gideon’s™ forces on the ground. After Bo-Katan loses her connection with Axe, she and the Mandalorians encounter more of Moff Gideon’s augmented Dark Troopers. Naturally, the Mandalorians prevail. Did we expect anything different, even from this little skirmish? Meanwhile, Din battles his captors after Gideon ordered them to take him to the interrogation room. Grogu appears with IG-12™ and helps his dad recover after defeating said captors. Din asks Grogu to be brave for him because the only way they’ll survive is if they kill Gideon here and now. No more running. Grogu is forever his papa’s brave boy. “Stay safe.” Mando reaches out to Bo-Katan and informs her of his status. She urges him to stay safe. Gideon’s troops take to the skies to destroy the Mandalorian fleet while Moff Gideon learns about Din’s escape. Putting on his beskar™ helmet, he vows to take care of our Mando himself. Ominous! Next, Din asks R5-D4™ to give him the coordinates to Moff Gideon’s command center. R5, our scared little guy, encounters a pesky mouse droid but still honors Din’s request. Axe makes it to the capital ship, where he orders the Mandalorians to evacuate and help Bo-Katan on the planet itself. Then, Axe remains on board the vessel to ensure it acts as a proper decoy for the fast-approaching Imperial troops. Suddenly, the enemy starts blasting at the capital ship. Here’s hoping Axe doesn’t die amid their incessant attacks. Deactivation Once Din and Grogu reach the outside of the command center, Din asks R5 for another favor: to deactivate the various barrier shields between them and the command center. While R5 does this, Din engages in another fight with Gideon’s troopers, while Grogu remains behind until the coast is clear. R5’s mouse droid buddy returns with a mini fleet to harass their newfound enemy. Thankfully, R5 completes the tasks and flies away. Next, Din and Grogu discover Gideon’s clones. After giving Grogu a nice jumpscare when one of them opens his eyes, Din destroys the clones. We don’t need more Gideons running around the galaxy. It’s How We Survive Meanwhile, the survivor captain and his partner take Bo-Katan and the Mandalorians to an underground cave full of flourishing flora. The captain reveals they planted farms with species indigenous to Mandalore. Life persisted even after the planet was abandoned. It’s a beautiful sentiment. The Armorer™ contacts Bo-Katan and reveals she’s en route with the Mandalorian fleet to battle Gideon’s troopers. So, Bo-Katan and the others fly out of the underground gardens for one last fight. Then, The Armorer and Bo-Katan reunite in the air for an epic aerial battle between the Mandalorians and Imperial troopers. Bo-Katan unleashes the Darksaber™ while The Armorer whips out her hammer. There’s something inherently badass about watching these two fight against troopers in the sky, not with guns but with a sword and a hammer. This scene is a feast for the eyes. An Unstoppable Army Later, Din reunites with Moff Gideon, who’s none too pleased that our Mando killed his clones. Gideon hoped to harness the one thing he doesn’t have power over — the Force. He wanted to create a Force-wielding clone army. Well, too bad, so sad. Gideon’s Praetorian Guard™ barges in to meet Din on the metallic battlefield. Admittedly, they look better here than in The Last Jedi™. Grogu doesn’t like watching his papa struggle. Eventually, the Praetorian Guard abandons Din to chase Grogu. Din attempts to immobilize the Guard, but Gideon steps in and lays the smackdown on Mando. Meanwhile, the Praetorian Guard takes IG-12 out of the equation, so Grogu faces his enemies alone. He tries to evade their attacks by flipping through the air. You know, standard green baby stuff. Din struggles in his fight against Gideon. Thankfully, reinforcements are on the way… Guess Who’s Back? Bo-Katan arrives on the scene, armed with her Darksaber. She encourages Din to rescue Grogu. While Din defeats the Praetorian Guard with the assistance of Grogu’s Force-wielding abilities, Bo-Katan squares off against Gideon. He wants the Darksaber back and will do anything to obtain it. The fight choreography is solid here. Meanwhile, Axe informs Bo-Katan that he’s crashing the now-blazing capital ship into Gideon’s base on Mandalore. Will he go down with the literal ship? Unfortunately, Gideon mangles the Darksaber, seemingly beyond repair. He whips off Bo-Katan’s helmet. With her weakened, Gideon looks to strike. However, Mandalorians are stronger together. Enter Din and Grogu, fresh off their victory against the Praetorian Guard. Now, Gideon is outnumbered. While our trio battles Gideon, the capital ship crashes into Gideon’s base, utterly demolishing it. Thankfully, Axe jumped out before the ship made impact. A Fiery Exit The flames from the ship’s explosion engulf Gideon. He’s toast(ed). Bo-Katan employs her shield, but it’s not nearly enough to encompass the trio. Miraculously, Grogu uses the Force to manipulate the fire, bending it around them. He’s a powerful little dude. After the flames from the explosion vanish, Grogu plops down on the ground. He’s all tuckered out. I don’t blame him. A Ritual Later, we see The Armorer complete Ragnar’s™ Mandalorian initiation ritual from the season premiere episode in front of the Living Waters™. Din brings Grogu in the hopes of having him complete it as well. However, Grogu is still too young to speak; therefore, he cannot recite the Creed™. He’ll remain a foundling. Din wonders if he can make Grogu his apprentice. The Armorer reveals he’ll need the permission of Grogu’s parents, and they don’t know if his parents are even alive. That’s when Din adopts Grogu. He wants it written in the Song. The Armorer accepts this and makes it so. Now, Grogu is Din’s adopted son and his apprentice. I’m not crying; you are. This is only the first time Din has referred to Grogu as such instead of “my ward.” Grogu is hereby known as “Din Grogu.” Meanwhile, Grogu spots the Mythosaur™ chilling in the depths of the Living Waters. I’d like to think the Mythosaur approves. For Mandalore Bo-Katan reignites the Great Forge in front of the Mandalorians. Axe shouts, “For Mandalore!” which gives rise to a chorus of chants from his Mandalorian comrades. Mandalore is back, baby! Meanwhile, The Armorer urges Din to take his apprentice Grogu on adventures. Their first stop? A visit with Captain Carson Teva™ on the Adelphi Base™. If you look closely at the cantina Din and Grogu enter, you’ll see none other than Dave Filoni as Trapper Wolf™. He’s even donning a hat. Teva and Mando chat while Grogu notices a droid head resembling the fallen IG-12. Din asks Teva to employ him and Grogu as bounty hunters for the New Republic. Well, for select missions, that is. Din’s a father, after all. Oh, and it’s gotta be off the books. The New Republic doesn’t need to know about it. Din will only require a small stipend and perhaps an advance. The advance in question? That droid head. Teva agrees to Din’s terms. Make Yourself at Home Later, Din and Grogu arrive on Nevarro with a gift for Greef Karga™: a new marshal. Turns out Din had the Anzellans™ reassemble IG-11™, who greets the crowd as the new Marshal of Nevarro. Greef is overcome with joy and gifts Mando his new cabin on the outskirts of the city. Now, at last, Din puts his feet up outside his new home. He watches his little green son make a frog levitate with his Force abilities. All is right in the galaxy (for now). This is an introvert’s dream. The Mandalorian Season 3 — and Season 4? “Chapter 24: The Return” is a nice cap on a somewhat uneven season. The Mandalorian takes big creative swings for its third season. Sometimes, the creative team’s efforts yielded fruit. Other times, they didn’t quite pan out. While I enjoyed the inclusion of familiar Star Wars™ faces in a live-action format and the introduction of new worlds/creatures in a bid to expand galactic lore, I missed the intimacy of the first two seasons. We didn’t get a lot of Din/Grogu relationship development in season 3. Thankfully, the season finale makes up for that, especially with Din finally recognizing Grogu as his son and adopting him. I wonder if season 4 will return to a more intimate scope of storytelling since Din helped take back Mandalore. Now, he has a homeworld to revisit whenever he likes, but it doesn’t necessarily have to be the focus. I think this season’s overall theme of community and unity catalyzed Din to adopt Grogu, so it served a purpose in that regard. Villains in the Shadows Maybe, with Moff Gideon out of the way, we’ll see Elia Kane™ and the Shadow Council™ resurface. There’s still Project Necromancer™ and the Empire’s endeavor to resurrect Palpatine™ to contend with. Plenty of narrative fodder for our Mando. Side note: I’ll miss seeing Giancarlo Esposito here. He’s such a formidable, imposing presence as Gideon. He’s captivating even with little screen time. Here’s hoping we get a season 4 greenlight soon. For now, I’ll stick to rewatching the show to get my Space Dad/Space Son fill. Did you enjoy The Mandalorian?

            "text": "The Mandalorian Season 3 Finale Review: Classic Star Wars Finish That’s Both Too Much And Not Enough\nThe Mandalorian Season 3 finale delivers some glorious action, but with a story that seems crammed to fit with a lot forgotten.\nGFR SCORE\nThe Mandalorian Season 3 finale — “Chapter 24: The Return” — on Disney+ is about as close as the series has come to delivering the same kind of exciting and multi-layered final showdown Star Wars features like Return of the Jedi made famous. Unfortunately, so much happens in this finale that it all feels crammed in at the last minute, and a lot of story seems to be forgotten; including something that the Internet has been abuzz about since last week.\nIn fact, so much is missing from The Mandalorian Season 3 finale, that I’ve gone back and rechecked four times to make sure there wasn’t a post-credits scene I missed (there isn’t).\nLike Return of the Jedi, The Phantom Menace, and Rogue One , “The Return” gives us engrossing battles on multiple fronts to finish the season. Din Djarin (Pedro Pascal), Grogu, and Bo-Katan (Katee Sackhoff) have their final confrontation with Moff Gideon (Giancarlo Esposito) and the same Praetorian Guard trio who killed Paz Vizsla (Tait Fletcher) last episode. Meanwhile in the skies above Mandalore Axe Woves (Simon Kassianides) holds off Gideon’s TIE Fighters, and the rest of the Mandalorians clash with the Beskar-reinforced Imperial troopers.\nThe action and the visual effects are spectacular and keep you cheering for The Mandalorian finale, unless you make the mistake of stopping to have thoughts about what’s going on.\nI’d rather not drop big spoilers: suffice to say a lot of very consequential things happen in The Mandalorian Season 3 finale, both in terms of the series and the Star Wars mythos as a whole. But “The Return” proves to be one of the shortest episodes of the season, and it all feels rushed.\nOne of the things fans have been expecting the most from The Mandalorian Season 3 finale is the reveal of who, if anyone, among the different tribes of Mandalorians has been secretly working with Moff Gideon. The three most oft-mentioned suspects were The Armorer (Emily Swallow) whose actions have been suspicious all season, Axe Woves who conveniently left as soon as the heroes were ambushed last episode, and the ragged survivors discovered on Mandalore. Boosting these theories was the title of the season’s penultimate episode: “Chapter 23: The Spies.”\nThe Mandalorian Season 3 finale reveals that the traitor was… no one? Axe Woves’ stated intent to save the fleet turns out to be genuine, and both The Armorer and the Mandalore survivors join in on the battle against the Beskar-reinforced troopers. With Star Wars fans debating this character’s suspicious behavior or another’s was a red herring, it turns out the very notion of there being a traitor was the red herring all along.\nRather than coming off as a clever twist, the absence of a traitor — or of anyone even mentioning the possibility of one — comes off as a sloppy omission. It wouldn’t be surprising to learn that there was originally meant to be a big turncoat reveal, but that the episode was rewritten at the last minute.\nThe main reason Axe Woves was in contention for a traitor reveal is because in “The Spies” he hightails it above ground almost as soon as the Imperial troopers reveal themselves, claiming he wants to warn the fleet. His explanation for leaving seemed like another big hint that he’d gone bad, considering the notion he could make it to the fleet seemed impossible. Yet he makes it, doesn’t seem to have much problem making it, and it’s one of the toughest things in The Mandalorian Season 3 finale to swallow.\nNow I am usually the last person to complain about stuff like this in Star Wars content; both because I’m not exactly a font of scientific knowledge, and because it seems to me that getting bothered about scientific inaccuracies in Star Wars is kind of like complaining that the latest John Wick sequel had too much violence, or that one of the Lord of the Rings films had too many swords.\nBut in the case of Axe Woves somehow managing to reach his the Mandalorian fleet in the Season 3 finale with nothing but his jetpack — which was at least in the upper atmosphere if not orbit — it isn’t about scientific inaccuracies. It’s about previous Season 3 episodes going out of their way to show us why what Woves did shouldn’t have been possible.\nIn every episode this season featuring characters traveling to Mandalore, we see how difficult it is for them to penetrate the atmosphere even when flying a ship designed to fly through space. Meanwhile in “Chapter 20: The Foundling,” after Paz Vizsla’s son is first taken by the winged beast, all the pursuing Mandalorians are forced to stop their initial chase because they run out of fuel, after not traveling nearly as far as Woves or through the same kind of atmospheric pounding.\nThe Mandalorian Season 3 finale also fails to give us any more of Elia (Katy M. O’Brien), Dr. Pershing (Omid Abtahi), or any more of Grogu’s mysterious backstory.\n“The Return” is a fun watch, but it feels like more and more we’re getting all the spectacle of Star Wars with The Mandalorian, but that the story supporting the spectacle is left wanting.",

            "text": "And just like that, The Mandalorian season 3 is over. Coming off a seemingly game-changing episode last week, the series’ highly anticipated season 3 finale, titled The Return, premiered this Wednesday on Disney+. To say that the episode wraps up all of The Mandalorian season 3’s remaining loose ends would be quite the understatement, too.\nNot only does the finale give fans the climactic confrontation between Moff Gideon (Giancarlo Esposito), Din Djarin (Pedro Pascal), and Bo-Katan (Katee Sackhoff) that they’ve long waited to see, but it also sets the latter two characters on totally different paths. For Bo-Katan, her role in the reconstruction of Mandalore seems to be just beginning. For Din Djarin, a new road has been laid out in front of him that isn’t all that different from the one he used to walk.\nHere’s how The Return sets the stage for a new era of The Mandalorian and explains some of the oddest aspects of its latest season.\nNote: The article contains major spoilers for the season 3 finale of The Mandalorian.\nSo long, Moff Gideon\nAt the end of The Mandalorian’s season 3 finale, Bo-Katan, Grogu, and Din Djarin successfully retake Mandalore with the help of their fellow warriors. In the process of doing so, it seems like the trio manages to finally defeat Moff Gideon, who is consumed in the explosion caused by a devastating Imperial cruiser crash. By seemingly destroying all of Gideon’s clones, Din also potentially eliminates the chance of his greatest nemesis ever returning.\nIn the minutes that follow, viewers watch as Bo-Katan and The Armorer (Emily Swallow) reignite the Great Forge of Mandalore and finally start putting their plan of rebuilding the planet into action. Din Djarin, meanwhile, not only officially adopts Grogu as his son, but also pitches himself as a part-time bounty hunter/independent contractor for the New Republic to Captain Carson Teva (Paul Sun-Hyung Lee), who seems more than interested in taking Pascal’s Mandalorian up on his offer.\nThe Mandalorian‘s season 3 finale subsequently ends with Din Djarin lounging around his new Nevarro cabin with Grogu while he awaits his next bounty hunting assignment.\nA return or a reset?\nThe Mandalorian’s latest season finale may be titled The Return, but it feels a whole lot more like a reset for the Disney+ series. After taking Din Djarin and Grogu increasingly farther away from their old-school bounty-hunting days over the course of its first two seasons, the live-action Star Wars show has set them on a path toward much more familiar territory. It’s done so by relieving Din of any real responsibilities he might have once had to his fellow Mandalorians, who have now banded together under Bo-Katan’s rule.\nWith that in mind, The Mandalorian season 3’s split focus on Din and Bo-Katan suddenly makes a lot more sense. For a while there, it looked like the series was teeing up Sackhoff’s Bo-Katan to take over as its lead character for Pascal’s Din, who seemed at different points throughout The Mandalorian season 3 like he was already halfway out the door. Now, it doesn’t look like that was ever going to be the case. Instead, it seems like The Mandalorian built Bo-Katan up this year simply so that someone else could shoulder the responsibilities that once seemed destined to fall on Din Djarin’s shoulders.\nThe Mandalorian season 3 has, in other words, found a way to once again have its cake and eat it, too. The series has essentially fulfilled its greater franchise responsibilities by leaving its Mandalorian reconstruction storyline in the capable hands of Bo-Katan, all while it has set the stage for its next season to be a much more straightforward, contained series of bounty-of-the-week adventures starring Din Djarin and Grogu.\nLet the bounty hunting begin (again)\nIn the end, The Mandalorian season 3 has turned out to be a fairly mixed bag. On the one hand, the season has progressed the show’s New Republic-era story forward in several interesting ways. On the other hand, it’s done so in a truly uneven, often narratively unfocused fashion. Knowing that it was, for all intents and purposes, essentially meant to serve as a reset for The Mandalorian does make understanding the season’s many odd creative decisions a bit easier.\nWhether or not that knowledge also makes The Mandalorian season 3 seem more or less satisfying is another conversation altogether, and opinions will likely vary from one Star Wars fan to another.\nAll eight episodes of The Mandalorian season 3 are available to stream now on Disney+.\nEditors' Recommendations\n- The Mandalorian season 3 episodes, ranked from worst to best\n- What the hell happened to The Mandalorian?\n- 5 questions we have after The Mandalorian season 3 episode 5\n- 5 questions we have after The Mandalorian season 3 episode 3\n- 5 questions we have after The Mandalorian season 3, episode 2",

            "text": "‘The Mandalorian’ Season 3 Finale’s Pedro Pascal and Baby Yoda Surprise\nTHIS POST CONTAINS spoilers for this week’s episode of The Mandalorian, “The Return.”\nA funny thing happens in the last 10 minutes of The Mandalorian Season Three: Din Djarin seems to be the central character again.\nJon Favreau, Dave Filoni, and company spent much of this season treating the show’s title as something that didn’t refer specifically to Grogu’s adoptive father, but to Mandalorian culture as a whole. We learned even more about the Watch’s silly rules regarding helmets, about the Mythosaur, and about tensions between different Mandalorian factions, and there were long stretches where Bo-Katan Kryze seemed like the protagonist of the show(*).\n(*) This is inside baseball, perhaps, but it’s telling that none of the Disney+ official photography for this episode features Din or Grogu, instead showing off Bo-Katan, Moff Gideon, and various random Mandalorians.\nPerhaps it’s only fair that Mando’s own show got hijacked after he did the same to Boba Fett in the later episodes of The Book of Boba Fett. But between Mando and Grogu’s emotional reunion happening on someone else’s series, Bo-Katan dominating this season, and the recent announcement that Filoni will be directing a Star Wars film that wraps up the combined plots of all the current and upcoming Disney+ series, it seems that the producers have started treating all of this as a never-ending crossover, rather than the father/son adventure show that made people fall in love with The Mandalorian in the first place. Even the MCU, which has become the model for so much modern franchise storytelling, generally understands that each movie or show has to stand on its own to some degree, and that means making sure the audience is invested in the central characters of that particular installment of the larger story. The approach the Star Wars shows have taken is losing sight of that.\nThough maybe this would feel like less of a problem if the series of late were better. Mando’s co-opting of Book of Boba Fett felt welcome at the time, because the spinoff had so completely miscalculated the appeal of its own title character; when Mando showed up, it felt like a relief to get a break from Boba’s tedious attempts to become a mob boss with heart. Once upon a time, The Mandalorian didn’t have this problem. It was a relatively uncomplicated, but extremely well-executed story that was clearly set in the Star Wars universe even as it focused on this one tiny relationship in a far corner of it. There were points in the second season that were perhaps too blatantly designed to seed future spinoffs (some of which are still coming, some of which never happened), but even then, the focus inevitably returned to the taciturn man of action and his adorable young charge.\nEditor’s picks\nSeason Three, though, fell victim to trying to do way too much, only some of it well. There was a whole episode, for instance, devoted to Moff Gideon’s pet scientist Dr. Pershing. That one had its moments, but doing such a big departure within the confines of an 8-episode, largely serialized season only makes sense if Pershing plays a big role later on. Instead, he never appeared again. Part of the finale involved Pershing’s work being used to create an army of Force-sensitive clones of Moff Gideon, but even that was presented in underwhelming fashion. Mando and Grogu stumble across the cloning chamber, Mando easily destroys the clones before he even fully knows what they are, and it’s not for several more scenes that we see the real Gideon’s outrage over his master plan being foiled. And, as was the unfortunate case with Boba Fett, the more we learned about Mandalorian society and traditions, the less interesting they became. The season tended to be at its best when the show went back to its Mission of the Week roots, notably a light-hearted but exciting outing where Mando and Bo-Katan played buddy cops while Grogu got to party with Lizzo and Jack Black.\nRelated\n“The Return” at least remembers that Din Djarin is the guy we originally came here to see. The episode is fairly evenly split between Mando and Grogu dealing with Moff Gideon, and Bo-Katan and the rest of her army fighting off the Imperial threat. On the latter front, the Mandalorians regain a bit of their mystique as we see them repeatedly triumph over an army of Dark Troopers who have been kitted out in Mandalorian-style armor. After destroying the Darksaber, Moff Gideon sneers that “Mandalorians are weak once they lose their trinkets,” but the action in the episode thoroughly disproves him(*).\n(*) On the other hand, what a disappointing end to the whole Darksaber mythos, as this legendary weapon gets crumpled fairly easily by a skinny guy in souped-up armor.\nThe climax feels rushed — after many episodes this season felt too long, this one could have benefited from a bit more breathing room — but it leads to a much more promising epilogue. Mando officially adopts Grogu as his son(*) and gains the Armorer’s approval to promote the kid from foundling to apprentice. From there, the duo cut a deal with Carson Teva: Mando will go back to his bounty hunting ways, hunting down Imperial remnants as an off-the-books operative for the New Republic. Teva gives Mando a spare IG droid head, which in turn allows the Anzellans to properly rebuild IG-11 and turn him into Nevarro’s new marshal, while Greef Karga sets Mando and Grogu up in a cabin where they can live “between adventures.” And we close with the two of them enjoying their new home(**), Mando sitting contentedly on his porch while Grogu uses the Force to play with — but, notably, not eat — a frog in the nearby pond.\n(*) The Armorer renames him Din Grogu, which doesn’t seem to track with the nomenclature rules we’ve seen on this show and Clone Wars. (See, for instance, Paz Vizsla and Pre Vizsla.) Shouldn’t he be called Grogu Djarin?\n(**) This at least gives us a belated answer to the question of where the two sleep, eat, etc., with a ship that’s so much smaller than the Razor Crest was. But the N-1 Starfighter still feels ill-suited for bounty hunting, unless there’s a hidden cargo compartment where he can store frozen prisoners for transport.\nTrending\nNeil Young and Stephen Stills Honor David Crosby, Revive Buffalo Springfield at Light Up The Blues\n‘Succession’: The Roy Siblings Meet Their Match in Alexander Skarsgård’s Lukas Matsson\nJustine Lupe on Willa, the Sex Worker Tied Up in ‘Succession’\nOK, Seriously, What Was Frank Ocean's Deal at Coachella?\nIt’s a nice moment, and a promising new/old status quo, assuming you read those final 10 minutes as the set-up for Season Four, rather than a happy ending for Din and Grogu before the series continues on with the rebuilding of Mandalore as its chief subject. The former seems more likely though, and hopefully Pedro Pascal will be more available next time around, rather than providing the voice while stuntmen Lateef Crowder and Brendan Wayne do everything else. (My guess is we would have seen Din’s face at least once if Pascal wasn’t busy making The Last of Us.)\nShared universes can be fun, but the crossover tail really wagged the individual series dog this season, and the overall storytelling was subpar by the standards The Mandalorian established in its earlier years. But a season where we get back to Mando chasing bad guys each week, with Grogu as his sidekick rather than as someone to be protected? Yes, please.",

            "text": "We’ve spent a week praising Chapter 23 (opens in new tab) and the balance that co-writers Jon Favreau and Dave Filoni, alongside director Rick Famuyiwa, struck between delivering weighty character moments and big spectacle. Hopes were high for the finale, and it mostly hit all the right notes. No unexpected pirouettes though.\nSeason 3 has been an uneven but ultimately satisfying ride, and it’s now clear that Favreau bet most of his chips on Bo-Katan (opens in new tab) and the retaking of Mandalore (opens in new tab). Grogu also solidified his position as the future bridge between the Jedi and Mandalorian cultures, and maybe it was Din who got the short end of the stick; until this last episode, there wasn’t much going on with him after since he bathed in the Living Waters in Chapter 18 (opens in new tab).\nSpoilers ahead for The Mandalorian Chapter 24: ‘The Return’\nThe return of who? Well, of the Mandalorians to Mandalore… we guess? Maybe the return of IG-11 is the closest thing this episode has to a twist? It’s hard to nail down what the last two titles were exactly referring to, as ‘The Spies’ set the Internet ablaze for seven days, only for ‘The Return’ to never answer that question. If the only spies were Elia Kane and other “reformed” Imperials like her who we haven’t seen, then that was an odd choice of a title for Chapter 23.\nAlthough the recap puts the focus on the cloning subplot, Doctor Pershing never comes back into the picture, and we have to wonder whether we’ll see him again at all. What does come up later in the episode is the endgame of his and Moff Gideon’s research, giving a resolution to the plotline that kicked off the show.\nBack on Mandalore, Bo-Katan and the remaining members of the party that got tricked hard in Chapter 23 are getting to safety and waiting for reinforcements to head back into Gideon’s base. A rescue of Din isn’t needed though, as he frees himself – with Grogu’s timely help – even before the title credits roll. A helmet-less face-to-face with the main villain would’ve been nice before things got hectic, but Favreau (sole writer once again) had other plans in mind. We have to guess Pedro Pascal really was quite busy with HBO’s The Last of Us.\nEssentially, ‘The Return’ feels like your average Star Wars finale on a smaller scale. The good guys are in trouble, and there’s a starship battle, a cool-looking duel, and armies clashing with some neat moments. Because of that – and because Famuyiwa’s direction remains strong – it’s hard to get mad at the safest season finale the show has had so far. In fact, it largely feels like an amped up version of Chapter 8 that reminds us of how far the main characters have come before ending Gideon’s threat for good.\nPerhaps the biggest surprise comes from outside the episode itself and is something that affects the entirety of season 3 – there has been a distinct lack of big Star Wars cameos versus season 2 and The Book of Boba Fett. As scattered (and often redundant) as the narrative has been, we can say The Mandalorian limited itself to being The Mandalorian this time around, even if it did recycle bits and pieces from the cancelled Rangers of the New Republic spinoff show.\nAs mentioned before, there are no spies to be found among the Mandalorians who followed Bo-Katan into battle, so Axe Woves gets to the fleet before the Imperials and orders everyone to abandon ship and reinforce Bo-Katan’s forces on the surface of the planet. The lack of treacherous Mandos marks one of the season’s many red herrings, with the second most important being the mythosaur's role. More on that later.\nMeanwhile, R5-D4 continues his personal odyssey and helps Din navigate Gideon’s base, shutting down the laser gates we saw in the last episode. R5’s heroic deeds after being denied a spot in Luke Skywalker’s story is one of the many little things we enjoyed about this season, and the A New Hope vibes of his scene hacking the system and dealing with pesky mouse droids were very welcome.\nAfter clearing the path to Gideon’s command center with some sick melee moves that instantly make Din cool again, we see that Gideon’s cloning program was all about… himself. It’s presented as this huge reveal, but the writing was on the wall after the last episode. Project Necromancer surely has to do with Palpatine’s return and/or Snoke’s creation, but the script underlined that project had nothing to do with Gideon’s own agenda even though both endeavors use Pershing’s cutting-edge research.\nGideon himself also confirms shortly afterwards that his ultimate goal was to “put the Force” into himself and his clones. Again, something that was pretty much established last episode with his expository dialogue after capturing Din. It underlines why Grogu was so important to his research and is another strong callback to storylines from the Legends canon, including the cloning of Starkiller in The Force Unleashed 2. So yeah, midi-chlorians very much mattered in the long run.\nA brief respite underground before the decisive battle gives Bo-Katan an almost surreal look at the beauty of Mandalore that still survives in some hidden places. It’s the last push the different factions of Mandalorians need to feel re-energized and ready to take the fight to Gideon’s troops.\nThe ensuing large-scale clash is pretty spectacular and reminds us of how freakin’ cool Mandalorians can be. The highlights come from Bo-Katan leading the charge with the Darksaber and the Armorer going wild in melee combat, even when flying, and the entire thing (once we get over the lack of spies and curveballs) feels like the logical finale to the Mandalore storyline told so far in this show.\nThe final duel between Din and Gideon is tense, as the Imperial warlord is anything but a pushover, and makes good use of his shiny, beskar-covered dark trooper suit, which is full of gadgets as well. We half-expected him to also reveal he was a Mandalorian once, given his obsession with their weapons and culture, but that never came.\nWhile we were worrying about Din’s life, Grogu also gets himself into big trouble… with the Praetorian guards! Those red guys sure like to make dramatic entrances. Unsurprisingly, the IG-12 mech suit lasts two seconds once they start slashing at the foundling, so he has to resort to Yoda flips to survive. Once again, it was hilarious to see a small puppet in distress jumping and running around.\nAfter struggling with Gideon for a while, Din gets to Grogu and manages to take out the guards with his little son’s help. This is only possible because Bo comes down for the rematch Gideon owed her. Again, the traditional Star Wars vibes took over most of this episode, and their duel leaned hard on the Luke vs. Vader showdowns and even pays homage to Finn vs. Phasma in The Last Jedi.\nMuch like Captain Phasma, Moff Gideon is consumed by the flames after Axe Woves drops a whole Imperial light cruiser onto his base. Woves doesn’t even have that much screentime in Chapter 24, but he’s low-key as much of an MVP as Bo and Din. By the way, the Darksaber is no more too. Leadership won’t be linked to a weapon anymore.\nThe “amplified Chapter 8” energy returns when Grogu shields himself and his two Mando guardians with the Force from the hellish flames. No small nap required afterwards, he’s a well-trained Padawan now.\nSo… what’s up with the mythosaur? Well, we do witness a ceremony at the Living Waters, bookending the season with the “baptism” of Ragnar Vizsla, who we’ll surely meet again. Din and Grogu’s father-son arc is also completely resolved here, with the titular Mandalorian (now that Bo-Katan has done her thing) officially adopting him, which allows our cute friend to fully become a Mandalorian… named Din Grogu. Yes, we also have many questions regarding the Mandalorian naming conventions.\nGrogu reaches out to the Living Waters and (clearly) senses the mythosaur, which seems to react back as well. No kaiju-sized monster wrecking the Imperial base nor Din or Bo riding it to reclaim the planet. Jon Favreau used the legendary beast on a more spiritual level, and that’s kind of cool when all is said and done. Grogu’s destiny is now fully linked to Mandalore and its people.\nAs for Bo-Katan Kryze, well, it appears she’ll finally get her true chance to rule over all Mandalorians now that the Empire’s presence has been cleansed from the planet. She’ll remain a centerpiece of the overarching narrative moving forward for sure, but it might be a while before the spotlight is put on her again.\nThe final stretch of the episode sees Din and Grogu visiting the New Republic base we saw earlier in the season. Dave Filoni and other creatives have background cameos, but Zeb doesn’t show up. It’s just a conversation between Carson Teva and the Mandalorian regarding work. Let’s not forget Din was a bounty hunter before he got roped into this whole mess, and there are many high-value targets out there, so maybe he can put his skills to good use while helping the New Republic take down troublesome individuals.\nWe also check back with Greef Karga, who still wants to give Din and his son (he’s officially a space dad now) a home on Nevarro. And this scene suddenly becomes Christmas (or should we say Life Day), as Din has also fixed IG-11 with the parts he desperately needed earlier in the season and which Carson Teva provided in the scene before. Was that IG-88’s destroyed head? We may never know. But one thing’s for certain: Taika Waititi has now replaced Gina Carano as the marshal of Nevarro.\nThe season ends with Din and Grogu taking some well-deserved rest in the outskirts of Karga’s town, cottage included. The episode, overall, kind of feels like a “soft ending” for the show so far, and frees the main characters from their many obligations to the larger narrative that will now evolve through the Ahsoka show. These two will of course return sooner rather than later (season 4 is already in the works), but a new horizon of possibilities has opened up for the next chapter of their own story.\nWas season 3 good? Yes. Could the writing have been better? Also yes. But we can argue it’s perhaps the most thematically rich of all three seasons so far, even when its shots didn’t land or its commentaries on religion and politics felt a bit murky. Its biggest success is giving fans and casual viewers alike a proper look into Mandalorian culture and their post-Empire diaspora, all while retaining the “adventure of the week” feeling for the most part, and that’s no small feat. Maybe Favreau could use an actual writers’ room to really chew on some of the richest ideas being thrown around, but this is still the Way.",

            "text": "SPOILER ALERT: The following contains details of the Season 3 finale of Disney+/Lucasfilm’s The Mandalorian, episode “Chapter 24: The Return,” written by Jon Favreau and directed by Rick Famuyiwa.\nSeason 3 of The Mandalorian wrapped with a nice bow versus any grave cliffhanger, or guest appearance from a Star Wars canon character ala Season 2, when a digitized version of Mark Hamill’s Luke Skywalker swooped in to scoop up Grogu for Jedi training.\nHeading into today’s episode, you could say we were all expecting a cameo by General Admiral Thrawn before his big splash in Mandalorian spinoff Ahsoka due out this August; he being one of the big bad Star Wars villains, having debuted in the 1991 Timothy Zahn novel Heir to the Empire, which took place post-Return to the Jedi. Thrawn, the most evil dead in a universe sans Darth Vader and the Emperor, led the remnants of the Imperial Forces against a fledgling New Republic, and was known for his tactical genius and keen sensibility to assess enemies’ tactics. He’s never been portrayed in a live-action Star Wars movie or TV show but was a big part of Dave Filoni’s Rebels animated series.\nWhy did we think Thrawn would make a cameo? Because he was named-dropped in the last episode of Mandalorian, “Chapter 23: Spies,” during a Shadow Council meeting (Captain Pellaeon declared that Thrawn will “herald in the reemergence of our military,” while Moff Gideon observed that Thrawn is always a no-show).\n“Chapter 24” picks up promptly where “Chapter 23” left off with Katee Sackoff’s Mandalore leader Bo-Katan Kryze and her posse retreating from Gideon’s HQ on Mandalore as the group is being pursued by his new white set of Beskar-armor dark troopers. Colleague Axe Woves says he’s flying off to get backup. Speaking of which, the new stormtroopers, Gideon in his new Mandalorian get-up and these Praetorian guards (who look like the Emperor’s royal guards from Return of the Jedi) are just impossible to take down; their uniforms have all the best gadgets of a Mandalorian’s including flame thrower, rope wire, darts and rockets. It takes a lot of guns, punches, darksaber slices and Grogu force maneuvers to take these guys out.\nDin Djarin, who is being hauled away by dark troopers, is saved by Grogu manning his IG-12 get-up.\n“If we don’t take out Moff Gideon, this will never end,” Din Djarin tells Grogu. “I’m going to need you to be brave for me, okay?”\nUm, the kid just saved you from dark troopers you couldn’t even handle.\nR5 assists Din Djarin in finding Moff Gideon’s location in the command center and taking down shields as our protagonist advances in the base. Din Djarin and Grogu stumble upon a hallway filled with the Imperial bad guy’s clones in water. Din Djarin punches a few buttons on a side computer thingy and all of the clones explode out of their pods. Moff poured water on the Shadow Council’s notions of clones in the last episode, but he’s been making ’em.\nThroughout the episode, there’s a lot of fighting in the sky by Bo-Katan and The Armorer against the dark troopers. There’s a certain portion of the series where Bo-Katan and her people learn that rich tropical farms were being cultivated on Mandalore. As Moff previously expressed, the planet was always rich with resources, which is why he plundered it and made it his Imperial hideaway. What do the Mandalorians think of the lush gardens on Mandalore? I think they’re planning on staying.\nMoff is irate that Din Djarin destroyed his clones which included “the best parts of me, but improved, but adding the one thing I didn’t have — the force.” Moff and Din fight, fight, fight. Bo-Katan swoops in and knocks Moff down. Grogu gets cornered by the three Praetorian guards behind closed doors. They destroy his IG-12 get-up, but he’s able to force jump above on a floating light rim as they attempt to slice at him. “I’ve got this, go save your kid,” Bo-Katan tells Din as she faces off with Moff. Ultimately, between fists, guns and Grogu’s force pull, together with Din, they overpower the guards.\nMeanwhile, Bo-Katan lights her darksaber at which point Moff ignites his purple spear. “Hand over the darksaber and I’ll give you a warrior’s death,” he tells her.\nBut then he destroys that which has been so prized over the last three seasons: the Darksaber. Now what?\n“You’ve lost everything,” he tells her. “Mandalorians are weak once they lose their trinkets.”\nAnd now the big takeaway per Bo-Katan: “Mandalorians are stronger together.”\nIf you think about trinkets lost: Din is stripped of his suit’s gadgets (in “Chapter 23”), while in the end, Grogu doesn’t have IG-12.\nAxe is flying a flaming, broken cruiser to the rescue; more specifically, diving the ship toward the Imperial base to fully destroy it. He’s able to fly out in time before it hits the command center, creating an enormous fire that swallows up Moff. Grogu is able to create a force field around him, Din and Bo-Katan, protecting them all from the fire.\nThe season wraps with Din telling The Armorer that he’s adopting Grogu, and the little green guy getting inducted as a Mandalorian foundling. Din and Grogu fly to a remote beach rebel port where they meet up with X-Wing commander Carson Teva. Din insists that Carson hire him on the down-low to protect the outer rim, despite what New Republic rules deem. Din and Grogu return to Nevarro where they’re gifted a home by Greef Karga (Carl Weathers).\nAs Disney+ Star Wars series’ immediate future is in Ahsoka, The Skeleton Crew, Andor Season 2 (August 2024) and the early days, High Republic-era set Jedi crime series The Acolyte, the question remains when we’ll see Din and Grogu again. It looks like they’ll be at that desert condo for some time on Nevarro. When is the next time we see them? 2025? It’s quite conceivable that Bo-Katan will bring Mandalore into a new era. But when does Grogu grow up? All Jedi-powered people go through an adolescent crisis and his cuteness is wearing thin. That was all good and fun in Season 1 with the whole True Grit Western homage.\nWhile Mandalorian does thrive on the adventure of the week, what’s the longer storyline here? Will Din Djarin bump up against a young Kylo Ren and the destruction of the Jedi temple? Can we intermingle him into Rey’s storyline? That would be cool. Is Grogu related to Yoda for crying out loud? Now that Moff is gone, who is the next dark Imperial rising? It’s time for The Mandalorian to evolve and break out of its Beskar armor.\nMust Read Stories\nSubscribe to Deadline Breaking News Alerts and keep your inbox happy.",

            "text": "The Mandalorian Season 3 Finale Disproves The Oldest Baby Yoda Fan Theory\nThe reason behind one mystery throughout all three seasons of The Mandalorian has finally been explained.\nThe reason why Moff Gideon wanted Baby Yoda and the secret to Dr. Pershing’s experiments have finally been explained. And it appears, one assumption fans have made since 2019 has been proven untrue. Very quickly, with one brief revelation, the Season 3 finale of The Mandalorian laid out exactly what was going on with Moff Gideon’s obsession with Grogu the whole time. And it’s not exactly what anyone thought. Spoilers ahead for The Mandalorian Season 3 finale, “The Return.”\nAs the combined Mandalorian forces fight back against Moff Gideon and his Imperial forces, Mando and Grogu discover a room filled with clones of one person — Gideon himself. There are no Snokes here, nor are there any Palpatines. Moff Gideon’s entire plan was not part of the larger plot to use cloning tech to bring Palps back to life, nor was it part of a coordinated effort among all the Imperial Remnants. Instead, what we learn is that Gideon was trying to create Force-attuned clones of himself, as a kind of glorified pet project. He tells Mando that the clones would have had “the best parts of me, but improved, by adding the one thing I never had — the Force.”\nGideon says he was “isolating the potential to use the Force.” This means that way back in Season 1 when the Client (Werner Herzog) and Dr. Pershing had Grogu strapped to the bed, they were trying to extract midi-chlorians. It also means, that in Season 2, when Gideon said he just wanted Grogu because he needed a bit of his blood, he was mostly telling the truth. And this revelation — combined with some new information from Episode 7 — oddly paints the entire series in a different light.\nMoff Gideon was acting alone\nThe Mandalorian Season 3 finale, as well as elements of the previous episode, “The Spies,” has recontextualized the actions of Moff Gideon throughout the entire series, and interestingly makes him seem less powerful than we once thought. In a sense, Moff Gideon is a Star Wars hobbyist, someone who wishes that he had cool armor like the Mandalorians or the ability to use the Force like a Jedi. Because he doesn’t have these things, he tries to steal aspects of these cultures for himself, and his future clones.\nIn “The Spies,” Moff Gideon tells Commandant Hux that he’s not interested in making clones after Hux accuses him of conducting experiments on Nevarro. The thing is, that’s exactly what Gideon was doing, in direct conflict with the Empire’s own plans. Not only was Moff Gideon obsessed with aspects of the Jedi, the Sith, and the Mandalorians, but he was also deeply narcissistic to the point of being maybe a little bit impractical.\nIn “The Convert,” Dr. Pershing says his research was “at the behest of a desperate individual intent on using cloning technology to secure more power for himself.” It’s now clear that individual wasn’t Palpatine, it was Gideon. Why Pershing didn’t just name him outright in his speech is odd, but it’s also unclear what Gideon’s endgame with his clones really was. Did he plan to transfer his consciousness into the bodies once they were imbued with the Force? If so, that plan is very similar to what Palpatine pulled off in the Legends comic Dark Empire. Or was Gideon just planning on having a bunch of copies of himself all hang out together? And if that was the plan, how could he ensure they followed his orders?\nHow Mandalorian Season 3 sets-up Ahsoka\nThe details of the rest of Gideon’s plan will probably never come to light. And when it comes to the various warlords of the Imperial Remnant, the Mando Season 3 finale paves the way for a new big bad to dominate everyone else. Whereas Moff Gideon felt like the most powerful remaining Imperial back in Mando Season 1, it’s now clear there are several warlords, and that all those competing voices will likely be unified under Grand Admiral Thrawn.\nBecause Ahsoka takes place in the same time period as The Mandalorian, it stands to reason that the new Imperial status quo will be a big part of that series. Moff Gideon’s defeat ties up loose ends for Mando, and demystifies years of complicated internet theories, all trying to figure out just exactly how Palpatine returned. But at this point, all of these plotlines seem resolved. So when Ahsoka Tano has to face Imperials in her own series, she won’t have any baggage leftover from The Mandalorian.",

            "text": "The Mandalorian Season 3 Episode 8 Review\nEpisode 8 of season 3 of The Mandalorian ends the season on a surprisingly definitive high note, by returning to what made the show good in the first place.\nAdmittedly, I wasn’t feeling overly optimistic going into episode 8 of season 3 of The Mandalorian, the final episode of what’s been a relatively disappointing season. I expected a lot more of the same issues that have plagued this season throughout its run, namely the lack of identity and the constant regelation of its best characters and storylines to the background. Somehow though, I ended up feeling pleasantly surprised, as the show gave us a season finale that I’d confidently rank among the season’s best offerings. How did it manage this major turnaround after a disappointing episode 7? Well, simply by doing the one obvious thing that we’ve all been clamouring for. They actually made the titular Mandalorian the main character again.\nThe majority of season 3 has been spent focusing on Bo-Katan Kryze (Katee Sackhoff), a fellow Mandalorian who previously served as a somewhat intriguing supporting character, and the quality of the show’s storytelling has suffered as a result. Sackhoff’s performance has consistently lacked the emotional gravitas to carry the show, and her character has constantly lacked any real emotional hook to invest the audience. So, going into a finale that promised to wrap up all the plot threads into an emotionally satisfying conclusion, I was worried that there would simply be nothing interesting to actually wrap up in the first place. To combat this issue, the show ends up returning to its most basic but effective emotional hook, namely the bond between Din Djarin (Pedro Pascal) and his adorable adopted son, Grogu.\n“Chapter 24: The Return” takes place almost entirely on an Imperial base, depicting the final confrontation between the Mandalorians and Moff Gideon (Giancarlo Esposito). The episode starts strong, with several thrilling fight scenes between Djarin and various Stormtroopers, before turning its attention to the main fight that the show has spent three seasons building up. Then though, there was some cause for alarm. For a couple of minutes in the middle, the show seemed to be teasing that it was going to be Kryze fighting Gideon, as Djarin seemed elsewhere entertained. As much as this would admittedly make sense for the end of a season that has spent so much time trying to build up Kryze as a character, it would have felt like a kick up the backside to those viewers who have gotten genuinely invested in Djarin as a character and his storyline which we’ve spent three whole seasons getting invested in, just for it to be completely thrown aside in favour of someone else entirely.\nLuckily, as if the show read my mind, they shift the spotlight back in the direction of Djarin and Grogu, where it firmly stays for the rest of the finale. Without delving into spoilers territory, there’s a very definitive feel to the whole affair. I’ve had a long-standing theory that the third season’s shift in story focus has been enforced due to Pascal wanting to leave the show, and this episode did nothing to counter those beliefs. The way they’ve set up themselves going into a potential fourth season, I really wouldn’t be surprised to see Djarin relegated to the odd cameo, with the show embracing the Mandalorians as a culture as its main characters.\nIf this is the end for Djarin, it’s a strong one. Not only do we get some great action scenes, but the actual emotional conclusion for his character nails the landing, with some very effective beats that almost got a wet eye out of me. Pascal, who at times has sleep-walked through this season, gives one of his stronger performances here, almost as if this is his swan song. An unfortunate side effect of Pascal stepping away from the show would be losing its mascot Grogu, who gets a beautiful ending to his story here. As a hardcore Grogu fanboy, I felt very well-treated here, with the show giving us plenty of emotionally satisfying moments for the adorable, scarily powerful child.\nThe finale isn’t completely without its problems though. I absolutely adore Giancarlo Esposito as an actor, but here he can just feel like a caricature of what you would expect from a performance of his. He’s always great at playing the subtle villain, but here he’s expected to play a more conventionally cheesy supervillain, and he ends up delivering a performance that feels incredibly forced and over-the-top. Not to mention, the actual character he’s been given is weak to begin with, as he lacks any kind of interesting trait or motivation to make him a compelling villain, instead just feeling like an executive wanted Esposito to be in the Star Wars universe because they liked him in Breaking Bad (2008-2013).\nWith “The Return”, season 3 of The Mandalorian manages to somehow end on a high note after a very rocky run. Looking ahead, I can imagine season 4 will feel like a very different show, so if this was meant to be a last hurrah for what The Mandalorian’s been over the course of the last 4 years, then it’s a good ending for what’s generally been a great show. As an actual finale to the season, there’s a lot that was brought up over the course of the last 8 episodes that is still yet to be explored, but knowing Disney they’ll inevitably make 10 spin-offs about every loose plot thread. At the end of the day, it’s a finale that’s emotionally satisfying in a lot of ways but might frustrate those who wanted every single plot thread to be perfectly tied up.\nThe Mandalorian ‘s Season 3 Episode 8 is now streaming on Disney Plus.",

            "text": "Warning! This article contains spoilers for The Mandalorian season 3 finale.\nThe Mandalorian season 3, episode 8 somewhat subverted fan expectations by proving many theories wrong in an explosive finale. After The Mandalorian season 3, episode 7's massive cliffhanger, many theories about what the finale would have in store began surfacing online. These theories only increased in size in the run-up to The Mandalorian season 3, episode 8, with the episode's release proving many incorrect.\nWith Pedro Pascal's Din Djarin ending The Mandalorian season 3, episode 7 in the hands of Moff Gideon, many expected a much more devastating finale than what was presented, potentially even the possibility that The Mandalorian would be over after season 3. In reality, The Mandalorian season 3, episode 8 ended fairly cleanly, with no major character deaths and a strong setup for further adventures with Din Djarin and Grogu. That said, here is every theory that surfaced online after \"Chapter 23: The Spies\" that The Mandalorian season 3, episode 8 proved vehemently wrong.\nRelated: The Mandalorian Season 4 Updates: Cast, Story, & Everything We Know\n7 The Armorer Was An Imperial Spy & Working WIth Moff Gideon\nOne of the more common theories after the ending of The Mandalorian season 3, episode 7 was that Emily Swallow's the Armorer was a spy for Giancarlo Esposito's Moff Gideon. This theory largely stemmed from the plural nature of episode 7's title, \"Chapter 23: The Spies\". While Katy O'Brian's Elia Kane was officially confirmed as a spy for Gideon operating from within the New Republic, the plural form of the word spy in The Mandalorian season 3, episode 7's title led many fans to believe another was hidden among the Mandalorians.\nThis was only furthered by the Mandalorians being led into Gideon's trap and, more importantly, the Armorer abandoning the battle before Gideon showed up. Many assumed that the Armorer was Gideon's spy, with some theorizing that she conspired with the Empire to rid the world of \"non-believer\" Mandalorians that do not follow the way of the Children of the Watch like Katee Sackhoff's Bo-Katan and her crew. However, this was proved wrong almost instantly in The Mandalorian season 3's finale, with the Armorer fighting alongside Bo-Katan to destroy the Imperial base and Gideon's cloning plans.\n6 Moff Gideon Wanted Grogu's Blood For Snoke Clones\nAnother theory that was created as early as The Mandalorian season 1 was that Moff Gideon was insistent on capturing Grogu to create clones for Emperor Palpatine, potentially leading to Snoke's creation. The inclusion of Dr. Pershing, the mention of Project Necromancer, and the overall plans of Grand Admiral Thrawn hinted at in The Mandalorian season 3, episode 7 only added more fuel to the fire, with many expecting the reveal that Gideon was serving the Emperor in season 3's finale. However, like many other theories, this was proved wrong.\nThe Mandalorian season 3, episode 8 revealed that Gideon was not cloning Palpatine at all, and was instead making clones of himself. Gideon coveted Grogu as a means of imbuing his clones with Force abilities in order to create an army strong enough to rebuild the Empire in his own image, as opposed to the plans Thrawn has. In The Mandalorian season 3, episode 8, Din Djarin destroyed these clones and seemingly killed Gideon, putting an end to his plans once and for all.\n5 Boba Fett Was Going To Return In The Mandalorian Season 3 Finale\nAnother theory that many held in high regard when concerning was that Boba Fett would return to aid the Mandalorians. Boba Fett has been absent from The Mandalorian universe since the finale of The Book of Boba Fett, with many expecting his re-appearance in \"Chapter 24: The Return\". As Bo-Katan was tasked with uniting all Mandalorians to retake Mandalore, one theory stated that Boba Fett would be part of this, despite his role as Daimyo of Mos Espa.\nHowever, The Mandalorian season 3, episode 8 had no feature of Boba Fett. This came as a surprise to many, with fans citing comments made by director Rick Famuyiwa and Din Djarin body-double Brendan Wayne as their reasoning for expecting a Boba Fett appearance. At Star Wars Celebration 2023, as reported by Collider, Famuyiwa stated that The Mandalorian's season 3 finale would bring resolution to both The Mandalorian and The Book of Boba Fett, with many taking that as confirmation of Fett's appearance.\nSimilarly, Brendan Wayne made some interesting comments in an interview with the Star Wars Sessions podcast. When asked about Boba Fett's potential return, Wayne stated that Fett is a great friend in that he always appears to help, even in situations when characters do not know they need him. Similarly to Famuyiwa's comments, fan anticipation grew from this that Boba Fett would appear to save Din Djarin and the other Mandalorians in The Mandalorian season 3, episode 8, something that proved untrue.\n4 Grand Admiral Thrawn Would Appear In The Mandalorian Season 3\nOne of the more commonly shared theories was that Grand Admiral Thrawn would appear in The Mandalorian season 3, episode 8. The confirmation of Lars Mikkelsen playing Thrawn in Ahsoka and the announcement of a climactic film directed by Dave Filoni centering on Thrawn vs. the New Republic has led many to expect hints at the character's emergence post-Return of the Jedi. The name-drop of Thrawn by Captain Pellaeon in The Mandalorian season 3, episode 7 in the Shadow Council meeting meant that many thought Thrawn may first appear in season 3's finale.\nLike the other theories in this list, Thrawn's appearance was disproved throughout The Mandalorian season 3, episode 8. The core conflict of The Mandalorian season 3's finale centered on Moff Gideon vs. the Mandalorians, something that benefits this show specifically in the long run. While having Thrawn appear in this episode would have set up both Ahsoka and Filoni's film, keeping the focus on Gideon and his feud with the Mandalorians allowed The Mandalorian season 3 to culminate its own story well rather than serve as simply a set-up of larger plots with no conclusion of its own.\n3 Din Djarin Would Be Unmasked By Moff Gideon\nAfter Mando was captured by Gideon in The Mandalorian season 3, episode 7, one common theory was that he would be unmasked by the Imperial leader. Be it as a means of torture, interrogation, or behind-the-scenes elements of Pascal's contractual appearances, fans assumed Din's helmet would be removed in The Mandalorian's season 3 finale. However, Djarin escaped in the episode's opening minutes and spent the rest of the time battling against Gideon's forces, meaning an unmasked Pascal was not seen in a season of The Mandalorian for the first time.\n2 Bo-Katan, Grogu, Or Din Djarin Would Ride The Mythosaur\nAfter the ending of The Mandalorian season 3, episode 2 introduced a living Mythosaur to the Star Wars universe, many thought the creature would appear in a climactic way in \"Chapter 24: The Return\". From theories that Bo-Katan, Grogu, or Din Djarin would ride the Mythosaur to lead the Mandalorians into battle against the Imperials to the more prominent role the creature would play in episode 8's story, it is clear the theories were misguided. The Mandalorian's season 3 finale only featured one brief shot of the Mythosaur still alive beneath the Living Waters in what was the first truly underwhelming subversion of a theory for The Mandalorian season 3.\n1 The Mandalorian Season 3 Finale Was Going To Kill Din Djarin\nAbove all, though, perhaps the biggest theory fans had for The Mandalorian season 3's finale was that Din Djarin would die. After Mando's story had been sidelined in season 3, many thought the title of the show would be pivoted towards Bo-Katan, something that was also hinted at during Star Wars Celebration. The theories stated that Din Djarin would be killed to achieve this, which was made more likely by his capture at the hands of Gideon. However, Din Djarin survived The Mandalorian season 3, episode 8, with his story being left open for more adventures with Grogu in the inevitable fourth season of the show.\nAll episodes of The Mandalorian season 3 are now available on Disney+.",

            "text": "Come one, come all, fans of The Mandalorian. Each Wednesday morning, we're breaking down the newest episode, from the best Grogu closed-captioning moment, to what’s going on with the latest friends and foes in Mando's redemption arc, to what it all means for the rest of the galaxy far, far away. Pop on The Mandalorian theme and dive in. This is the way.\n\"Chapter 24: The Return\"\nDisney+'s Cryptic Plot Summary: The Mandalorian and his allies confront their enemies.\nMain Players: Mando, Grogu, Bo-Katan Kryze, and Moff Gideon—plus his clones!\nDirector: Rick Famuyiwa, who gets behind the Mandalorian camera for the sixth time. This group of Star Wars directors needs green jackets, a la the Saturday Night Live! five-timers club.\nCan't-Miss Star Wars Easter Egg: Dave Filoni casually hanging out at the bar, watching Captain Teva and Mando wheel and deal.\nBest Grogu Closed-Caption Moment: [Chewing.]\nCaptain's Log\nYou Did Good, Kid\nAt long last, The Mandalorian let Chef Grogu cook. It's been a while. After forcing the kiddo to sit on the sidelines for most of the season, The Mandalorian finale puts Grogu in a multitude of dastardly situations: The Red Guard trying to buzz-buzz him out of existence! Meanie Moff making moves to kill dad! It's fun as heck watching Grogu waddle out of trouble, use the Force to remind you about his summer at Luke Skywalker's camp, and protect his friends from flames. (Again!) The Mandalorian, as always, is at its best when it remembers that Mando and Grogu are the beating heart of this story—and not the dude who spontaneously decides to torpedo all his friends with a giant spaceship.\nThe Clone Wars, Part Two\nSo... after three seasons of building up Moff Gideon as this cool, rebellious Imperial baddie, this is how his story ends? Apparently, Moff was trying to clone himself the whole time. Mando stumbles into the room where Moff is growing all of the clone Moffs, and drowns them all. Dark! This evidently pisses Moff off to the point of wanting to fight Mando to the death—which they do. Of course, Mando wins, and a ball of flames engulf poor space Giancarlo. (But you have to imagine that he was protected, if need be, by all that Beskar armor—should Disney need Giancarlo Esposito's talents again. This is what announcing a massive, big-screen team-up movie will do to your story.)\nHome Sweet Home\nWell, it's not exactly the journey we expected in Season Three, but the destination is all the same: The Mandalorians return to Mandalore. Bo-Katan Kryze lost the Darksaber in the process—there goes that storyline!—but she restored her family's glory, nonetheless. It feels like Disney is setting up the crew on Mandalore to function similarly to how the Wakandans were relegated to backup army duty in Avengers: Infinity War and Endgame, i.e. a powerful, gadget-wielding group of people to take out any and every disposable goon. Bo-Katan Kryze ignites the Mandalorian Forge, and we say goodbye to them. For now.\nHouse Hunters: Galaxy Edition\nDin Djarin and his young son of mysterious origin, Grogu, need a one-bedroom cabin—preferably, with a frog pool—to serve as a home base for their adventures. Is The Mandalorian-HGTV crossover audience that small? Fine. After the big battle, The Armorer agrees to promote wee Grogu from foundling to apprentice and officially let Mando adopt the kid as his son, Din Grogu. It's a sweet moment. The two jet over to the bar that Captain Teva apparently never leaves, where Mando asks the man if he can start wiping out Imperial remnants for the New Republic as an \"independent contractor.\" Teva doesn't agree, necessarily, but Mando takes it as a yes. This season ends with Mando and Grogu settling into the Nevarro cabin that Greef Karga promised them. Peace at last.\nOfficial Grogu Metric Rating™\nSix Grogus out of ten. Let me say this: I respect Jon Favreau and co. resisting shared-universe-cameo-post-credits-scene disease with this finale. I wasn't looking for Luke to crash another party! Just remember how Season Two ended. The shot of an unmasked Pedro Pascal and Grogu—which meant something. We didn't need some expository he's my son now! to know that Mando had love for the kid. The Moff Gideon fight in that episode felt like more than a tussle between the good and the bad guys. The Darksaber changed hands. We were left with the promise that Boba Fett's story was going... somewhere. That was all satisfying enough—medicine during the first holiday-season wave of the pandemic—even without Luke Skywalker. It was a story of fathers and sons, and the creeping, terrifying responsibility of just being good. Star Wars at its best.\nThe Season Three finale? It looked a lot like WandaVision's dueling CGI blows. (Which looked a lot like The Falcon and the Winter Soldier's action-toy finale. Which looked a lot like The Book of Boba Fett's ending, where everyone met in the town square and things went boom.) Mando and Grogu's character development? It's a dilution of their Season Two finale heart-to-heart. Instead of learning the end of Grogu's Order 66 journey (the child's parentage was hinted again!), or his first words, we're just served formal adoption papers. It's been hard watching The Mandalorian evolve from a true standalone Star Wars story to a shared-universe vehicle that plays its own hits.\nNext Week on The Mandalorian...\nOn that note! I'm genuinely surprised that Favreau is telling French-language TV stations that he's already written the Season Four script. Because \"Chapter 24\" reads very much like Mickey Mouse gave the directive for The Mandalorian to wrap things up and tie them with a little bow. Why, you ask? The Mandalorian movie, of course. Disney plans to wrap up The Mandalorian, The Book of Boba Fett, plus upcoming series Ahsoka and The Skeleton Crew in one \"culminating\" film. This finale feels very much like the end of Avengers: Infinity War, when Marvel left Thanos in an easy-to-reach plot of land, so the heroes could bust him up at the beginning of Endgame.\nSo what will happen in Season Four? After a season that introduced a solo journey for Dr. Pershing and dropped it immediately afterward (?!), I'm hesitant to speculate. Whatever does happen, bet your credits that it'll serve the larger interests of this big ol' New Republic movie. Can we expect the return of CGI Luke Skywalker? Probably not. How about a cameo from some other Star Wars friend, like Leia? Maybe. Will Grogu eat snacks? Definitely.\nUntil we meet again, I want to thank you for following along with The Mandalorian at Esquire this season. It's been a pleasure (and sometimes a pain!) recapping for you. This is the way.\nWatch The Mandalorian on Disney+",

            "text": "Warning: This post contains spoilers for The Mandalorian season 3 finale.\nWith the help of a united Mandalorian front, Grogu’s Force training, and a few nerve-wracking last-second saves, the season 3 finale of The Mandalorian saw Din Djarin (Pedro Pascal), Bo-Katan Kryze (Katee Sackhoff), and their fellow Mandalorian warriors finally put an end to Moff Gideon’s (Giancarlo Esposito) reign of terror and retake their home planet of Mandalore.\n“Chapter 24: The Return” picked up right where the previous episode left off, with Bo-Katan rallying the Mandalorians against Moff Gideon and his troopers. Meanwhile, Grogu was busy utilizing his new IG-12 mech suit to free Din Djarin from Imperial clutches. This led to Din Djarin discovering what Moff Gideon had been up to since escaping New Republic custody and turning Mandalore into his base: cloning himself in hopes of creating a Force-sensitive army that could reclaim the galaxy far, far away for the Empire.\nDin Djarin made quick work of destroying the clones, but still had to deal with Moff Gideon and the three Praetorian guards who showed up in last week’s episode. Of course, an epic final confrontation ensued, with Din Djarin, Bo-Katan, and Grogu teaming up to defeat Moff Gideon seemingly once and for all.\nHow does The Mandalorian season 3 end?\nThe Mandalorian season 3 finale ended on a happy note, with Bo-Katan assuming her role as ruler of Mandalore and leader of the now-unified Mandalorians, and Din Djarin officially adopting Grogu—or as the Armorer (Emily Swallow) renamed him, Din Grogu—in order to take him on as an apprentice.\nWith Mandalore at peace, Din Djarin and Grogu returned to Nevarro, where Greef Karga (Carl Weathers) informed them that he had set aside a plot of land where they could live when they weren’t gallivanting around the galaxy on an occasional mission for the New Republic—a deal that Din Djarin arranged with Captain Carson Teva (Paul Sun-Hyung Lee).\nThe ending certainly seemed to suggest that this chapter in The Mandalorian saga is now closed. But considering creator Jon Favreau has already written a fourth season, it seems likely that we’re still going to see Din Djarin, Grogu, and other fan-favorites set out on new adventures going forward. As Favreau told Entertainment Weekly, he has no interest in leaving these characters behind.\n“I don’t know what would make me not enjoy doing it, especially as long as the audience is connecting with these characters,” he said. “This feels like a really enjoyable moment. And I love this format of telling one chapter at a time and keeping the audience guessing, but also fulfilling certain expectations.”\nWhat’s next in the Star Wars universe?\nThere’s also a chance that any number of characters from The Mandalorian could show up in other Star Wars projects set to take place in the same time period, including Disney+’s Ahsoka series (set to premiere in August 2023) or Skeleton Crew (possibly set for 2024). Andor season 2 is also supposedly on the way in 2024, in addition to The Acolyte, a new show set during the High Republic era, 200 years before the events of the prequel movie trilogy.\n- Meet the TIME100: The Most Influential People of 2023\n- How Stand Your Ground Laws Factor Into Ralph Yarl Shooting\n- What the CDC's New COVID-19 Vaccine Recommendations Mean for You\n- Roman Roy Has Always Been Succession's Most Empathetic Character\n- What to Know About Florida's New 'Don't Say Gay' Rule\n- Why Moms on Instagram Love Minimalism\n- Guy Ritchie on Trying His Hand at Serious Violence for a Change\n- Why SpaceX's Starship Explosion Is No Big Deal\n- Introducing the TIME CO2 Earth Awards",

            "text": "SPOILER ALERT: This story discusses major plot points in the Season 3 finale of “The Mandalorian,” currently streaming on Disney+.\nIt took all eight episodes of Season 3 for “The Mandalorian” to find its way back to itself, which is to say, back to Din Djarin (Pedro Pascal) and his (now officially!) adopted child, Grogu. For most of Season 3, the core relationship of the series — the reason why “The Mandalorian” became an instant global phenomenon — was shunted aside in favor of tracking how Katee Sackhoff’s Bo-Katan Kryze rallied the estranged factions of Mandalorians to take back their devastated homeworld.\nAudiences have not responded kindly. Legions of reviews, tweets and YouTube videos vivisected this season of “The Mandalorian” for being “detached,” “unsatisfying,” “sloppy” and “the worst.” What had been a loose and uncomplicated story of Din and Grogu’s ongoing adventures had become instead a sprawling narrative steeped in Mandalorian lore that was brand new (and, even worse, uninteresting) to most people watching. An ironic strength of the show — audiences projecting themselves into Din’s helmet in the absence of Pascal’s deeply expressive face — became a major liability, with episodes in which dozens of helmeted Mandalorians talked to each other in dry, monosyllabic monotones, with nary a human face to be seen.\nThe Season 3 finale at least appeared to resolve Bo-Katan’s storyline, with the two major factions of Mandalorians uniting to defeat the seemingly unkillable Moff Gideon (Giancarlo Esposito), who’d set up a hidden Imperial base in the ruins of Mandalore. They did so in grand-if-derivative “Star Wars” fashion, with cross-cutting battles in space and on the ground, as Gideon faced off against Din and Bo-Katan while he sported shiny black armor that evoked Darth Vader with the subtlety of an AT-AT. And Grogu got in the mix as well, tussling with some of Gideon’s troopers while controlling the hollowed-out body of the IG-11 droid from Season 1.\nEven with this resolution, however, “The Mandalorian” fumbled some basic storytelling: For three seasons, Gideon has hinted at a grand plan to retake the galaxy that involved kidnapping Grogu and stealing some of his blood. One Season 3 episode abandoned Din and Bo-Katan to further draw out this plotline, shifting to Courscant to track how Gideon’s main scientist, Dr. Pershing (Omid Abtahi), was struggling to reintegrate himself into the New Republic — a storyline that was ultimately left dangling.\nInstead, in the finale we finally get to see the fruits of Gideon’s labors, in the form of incubation tanks housing clones of Gideon that have been infused with Grogu’s blood and given power over the Force. But rather than see any of Gideon’s unholy creations in action, Din pushes some buttons on a control panel to explode the containers and destroy them before they’d even drawn their first breath.\nCould more Gideon clones be housed elsewhere? Totally. Could Gideon have survived the massive fireball that consumed his body and destroyed his base? Sure. Was watching all of this unfold depressingly anti-climatic? Absolutely.\nFor better or (mostly) worse, Season 3 of “The Mandalorian” ultimately felt like the concluding act of this era of the show — even the episode title, “The Return,” evoked “Return of the Jedi.” By the finale’s end, Bo-Katan and the Mandalorians had successfully recolonized Mandalore, and Din had declared himself to be Grogu’s adoptive father and Grogu to be his Mandalorian apprentice. Which meant, by Mandalorian creed that seemed to be made up on the spot to finally free Din and Grogu from this interminable storyline, the pair had to go off on their own on a series of adventures.\nIn just a few scenes, “The Mandalorian” reasserted its original premise: Din partnered with New Republic ranger Carson Teva (Paul Sun-Hyung Lee) to help root out Imperial remnants on the outer rim of the galaxy, and he established a homestead for himself and Grogu back on Nevarro. The inherent promise is that Season 4 of the show will return to what made Season 1 so enticing: A series of one-off adventures in which a lone gunman and his resplendently adorable child explore the galaxy and tussle with bad guys.\nAlas, “The Mandalorian” is also ultimately meant to feed into a culminating feature film alongside the events of “The Book of Boba Fett” and the upcoming Disney+ series “Ahsoka,” where the shenanigans on Coruscant and the talk of Grand Admiral Thrawn are expected to continue. So while Season 4 may get back to basics, it won’t stay that way.",

            "text": "The Mandalorian Season 3 Finale a Definitive Exclamation Point: Review\nDisney+'s The Mandalorian Season 3 ends on a high note, with Pascal, Sackhoff, Esposito, and Kassianides shining in \"Chapter 24: The Return.\"\nDisney+ & Lucasfilm's The Mandalorian wrapped its third season in \"Chapter 24: The Return.\" It was the second-half of a two-part epic arc involving the surviving tribes of Mandalore led by Bo-Katan Kryze (Katee Sackhoff) and a contingent of the Empire led by Moff Gideon (Giancarlo Esposito). While Pedro Pascal's Din Djarin ceded a good chunk of the spotlight in favor of Sackhoff's Bo, he certainly recaptured a huge chunk of that glory along with Grogu. The following contains minor spoilers.\nThe Mandalorian: Epic Battle Against the Empire\nNot much of a deep dive considering this is the second part of a greater battle in which the Mandalorian tribes are trying to overcome the overwhelming odds atypical of the Star Wars franchise, regardless of whether it's the Empire or the First Order. As expected, we do get top-notch choreography from the major parties. We get epic fights on multiple fronts where everyone takes the opportunity to since. The fight between Gideon, Djarin, and Bo is certainly one of the best fights of the franchise, and putting it into words clearly doesn't do it justice. It's clearly the highlight of season three, as you don't get any ringers or special guest stars to save the day. It also represents what the viewers should've been given more of throughout the season – not \"too little, too late,\" but damn close.\nWhile there are plenty of moments (Emily Swallow's The Armorer and Mercedes Varnado's Koska Reeves shine), the surprising standout is Simon Kassianides' Axe Woves, which proved that his standing in his tribe wasn't just for show. Given production value and increased scale, it certainly has that cinematic chaos reminiscent of the Saga days or perhaps, more accurately, the Star Wars: Battlefront games. The difference is we're not being bombarded by Jedi. As per anything with the franchise, the story does have ties to the previous canon since this does take place prior to the sequel trilogy, and it's an interesting tie-in. Season three of The Mandalorian isn't like its predecessors, but it delivered where it counts. Given how this season ends, I'm perfectly happy if this became the series finale. With the way Dave Filoni has things mapped out ahead of his big-screen storyline wrap-up, maybe now would be a good time to end this chapter. Whatever ends up happening, Disney+ & Lucasfilm's The Mandalorian found a way to land a shaky, uneven season on a strong note.\nThe Mandalorian Season 3 Episode 8 \"Chapter 24: The Return\"\n8.5/10\nCreator Jon Favreau put a strong exclamation point on the third season of Disney+ & Lucasfilm's The Mandalorian. Clearly, the biggest highlight was the epic fight between Pedro Pascal's Din Djarin and Katee Sackhoff's Bo-Katan Kryze against Giancarlo Esposito's Moff Gideon. And having unsung heroes like Simon Kassianides' Axe Wolves, Emily Swallow's The Armorer, and Mercedes Varnado's Koska Reeves' in play only boosted the episode's efforts to land an uneven season with a viewer-worthy finale.\nCredits\nDirector\nRick Famuyiwa",

            "text": "Ever since Disney+ brought Marvel and Star Wars to television, there's been an increased interest in runtimes. Those have always been a hot topic among fans when it comes to movies, but it's now the case for these small screen offerings as well.\nUltimately, it boils down to us all simply wanting more, but if you're hoping for a giant-sized The Mandalorian season 3 finale a few hours from now, there's a strong chance you'll be disappointed. While it's more than the mere 25 minutes some \"scoopers\" claimed it would be earlier this month, it's been revealed (via SFFGazette.com) that the episode is going to clock in at just 38 minutes and 56 seconds.\nIn fairness, that's roughly the same length as the season 3 premiere, \"The Apostate,\" but it's quite a bit shorter than The Mandalorian's previous finales. Season 1's \"Redemption\" was 50 minutes, while season 2's \"The Rescue\" was 48 minutes. That makes this the show's shortest finale to date, a surprise when there's so much story to cram in before we once again bid farewell to Din Djarin and Grogu.\nIt's possible we'll be left with a cliffhanger that sets the stage for season 4, of course, and this is a more than adequate amount of time for Moff Gideon to be defeated, Bo-Katan Kryze to establish herself as Mandalore's ruler, and possibly even reveal whether there's a traitor in their midst.\nAs per usual, there's no word on what to expect from this episode, though we do know Rick Famuyiwa is at the helm after also directing \"The Spies\" last Wednesday.\nDisney and Lucasfilm go to great lengths to stop spoilers from leaking online and that means critics won't get to see the finale in advance. Needless to say, you'll want to check back here tomorrow for our breakdowns of everything that happens.\nAre you excited for The Mandalorian's season 3 finale?",

            "text": "This review contains some spoilers for season 3, episode 8 of The Mandalorian, “Chapter 24: The Return.”\n“Chapter 24: The Return” caps off the uneven season 3 of The Mandalorian in a dull and unremarkable fashion. In a season that saw the focus shift away from the bond between Din (Pedro Pascal) and Grogu in favor of political machinations, Bo-Katan’s (Katee Sackhoff) personal journey, and the revival of the Mandalorians as a whole, it felt kind of strange to swerve back to the relationship between our two leads. And while a lot of the hanging threads were tied up by the end of the episode, I was left wondering what the past eight hours of storytelling were all really for.\n“The Return” picks up right where the last episode left off, with Din being taken captive and Bo-Katan leading the rest of her crew away from Moff Gideon (Giancarlo Esposito) and his super troopers. Of course, Mando doesn’t stay shackled for long, and between this and HBO’s The Last of Us, it’s the second time in a 2023 season finale that Pedro Pascal pulled a fast one on two armed guards escorting him as a prisoner. Though I guess this finale was a bit less of an ethical and moral gray zone than The Last of Us.\nThis chapter, once again directed by Rick Famuyiwa and written by Jon Favreau, moved at a brisk pace and featured some exciting action set pieces. I dug Mando fighting waves of modified stormtroopers through a series of corridors blocked off by laser gates. This sequence had echoes of Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon battling Darth Maul in The Phantom Menace, which is something that’s always appreciated.\nIt also highlighted Mando’s resourcefulness, as he picks up new weapons and shields from his fallen enemies at every stage, exuding heavy video game vibes in a pretty effective way. Plus, this was paired with a really great visual gag of a growing number of mouse droids bumping up against R5 as he attempts to unlock Mando’s way forward.\nBut while I liked the individual action beats across the episode, I had a hard time wrapping my head around it all at a larger plot-structure level. My main problem here was that the stakes of the battle are never really fully realized. When Bo-Katan rallies her fellow Mandalorians, saying, “Let’s take back our planet,” before they all jet off to battle, I had no idea what kind of odds they were facing. Did Moff Gideon and the burgeoning proto-First Order have dozens of troops? Hundreds? Thousands?\nThis lack of clarity regarding the finer details of both individual motivations as well as the greater picture as a whole was a persistent problem throughout this entire rocky third season. After several episodes of the story meandering through various tangents, it felt like this last act just whizzed by without the level of build-up I would’ve liked to see.\nOn top of this, Moff Gideon has been a lingering issue for me throughout the whole of the series. Giancarlo Esposito is a fantastic actor in everything from Do the Right Thing to Better Call Saul, but he felt extremely underutilized during his brief runs on The Mandalorian. It felt like each season would try to cram him into wherever the plot might be in the final few episodes, but he never had time to really breathe or grow as an adversary.\nIn addition to all of this, the ultimate reveal that he was using Dr. Pershing’s (Omid Abtahi) Project Necromancer to create a clone army of himself imbued with the Force was the kind of one-dimensional motivation that works for a single episode. But as the culmination of three seasons of build-up, the whole thing just fell flat for me.\nBy the time the credits roll, this episode succeeds in wrapping up a lot of the sidequests that were set up at the start of the season. Bo-Katan finally comes into her own as a leader, and the combination of flora growing back on the surface of Mandalore along with the waking of the Mythosaur points to a rebirth for the planet and its people.\nAs for our two leads, Mando adopting Grogu so that he can have him baptized as a Mandalorian is equal parts sweet and dumb as hell. This is followed up by Greef Karga (Carl Weathers) giving Din a plot of land on Nevarro to call home and repairing IG-11 (Taika Waititi) to have him become the new sheriff in town. With all that done, the ending feels very much like a return to the status quo, of course with the lingering promise that Din and Grogu will be around to help out with any dirty work the New Republic might need done.\nIt ultimately felt like this season couldn’t decide if it wanted to be a bridge between Rebels and the upcoming Ahsoka, a salvaging of the canceled Rangers of the New Republic series, or just more of what made us fall in love with The Mandalorian in the first place. And by not having a clear focus, we’re instead left with eight episodes of a room-temperature sampler platter that are just empty calories we’ll forget about tomorrow.",

            "text": "[Editor’s note: The following contains spoilers through the Season 3 finale of The Mandalorian, “Chapter 24: The Return.”]\nFor the first time, a season of The Mandalorian ended without us getting a single glimpse of Pedro Pascal’s face — and maybe we’ll never see it again in a Star Wars. The Season 3 finale might have set up a narrative path for a potential Season 4, but otherwise “Chapter 24: The Return” plays very much like a series finale, providing the answer to that one haunting, existential question: Can a single Mandalorian, in a galaxy far far away, really have it all?\nThe answer being, of course, yes — if “it all” can be defined as a nice little cabin of his own, a happy adorable son, and a shiny starship he can use for the occasional hunting of bounties (as an independent contractor for the New Republic). Save going back to that planet from Season 1 and picking up that hot widow, it’s hard to imagine a happier potential ending for the character.\n“The Return” picked up on the dramatic cliffhanger of last week with the Mandalorians under attack by Moff Gideon (Giancarlo Esposito) and his forces, and the ensuing battle is an impressive multi-front assault with many thrilling sequences, including Din bare-knuckle brawling through a series of Imperial commandos, no shortage of aerial fights enabled by jetpacks, and Axe Woves (Simon Kassianides) jamming the Mandalorian capital ship right into the Imperial base.\nAfter Baby Yoda Grogu (it still feels wrong) uses the Force to protect Din and Bo-Katan (Katee Sackhoff) from the ensuing inferno, it’s all about wrapping up loose ends: Din officially adopts Grogu as his son, and Grogu takes the Creed; Din offers his services as a bounty hunter to our favorite New Republic captain (like any good freelancer, Din knows that the key to steady work is solid relationships); and Nevarro gets its own robot sheriff, thanks to a retrofitted IG-11 (still voiced by Taika Waititi).\nThere are maybe one or two loose ends here, still, and as a huge Amy Sedaris fan I’d be thrilled to see Peli Motto return again. But when we met Din Djarin all the way back in 2019, he was a loner with loose ties to a fragment of Mandalorian society, the Mandalorians themselves having been scattered across the galaxy. Season 3 ends, though, with the Mandalorians returned to a place of power on their homeworld (with no judgment if you do or don’t choose to keep your helmet on all the time), and the fires of the Great Forge relit.",

            "text": "The Mandalorian’s third season kicked off with a jarring reminder. In order to understand how Din Djarin (Pedro Pascal) and his nonverbal ward Grogu ended up reunited after their emotional goodbye in season 2, which made it seem like the pair would be split up for a much longer time, you also had to watch The Book of Boba Fett. The logic behind that choice — Disney using the hype around one show to goose interest in another — was easy to understand as part of the studio’s exhausting project to keep everyone constantly thinking about Star Wars with a steady stream of interlocking shows.\nBut rather than simply setting up whatever it is that Jon Favreau has pitched for the show’s next chapter or bringing in another Star Wars heavy hitter for a cameo designed to send fans into a tizzy, The Mandalorian spent its third season worldbuilding just for the sake of it — a choice that was always going to leave some people unsatisfied. In its season 3 finale, “Chapter 24: The Return,” The Mandalorian finally got itself “back on track” by ultimately leaving Mando and Grogu in a somewhat similar situation to the one they found themselves in when the series was first getting started.\nThe Mandalorian’s path to “The Return’’ was as haphazard as it was scenic, and this season wasn’t without its puzzling quirks. To call the season a failure, though, is a bit of an overstatement given what The Mandalorian is trying to be: an adventure that never ends.\nThough it took a little while for its larger themes to come into focus, The Mandalorian’s third season was ultimately a longform exploration of Mandalorian culture and history that reinforced how Din Djarin is part of something much larger than himself or his jobs, despite his insistence on working mostly solo. When we were first introduced to Mando and Grogu, there was quite a bit of novelty to the idea of shiny new spins on Boba Fett and Yoda — because that is what these characters are at their cores — being destined to become family to one another.\nThroughout the show, the significance of Grogu being a member of Yoda’s species and preternaturally strong in the Force has never been downplayed, and his powers are precisely what made him so important to both heroes like Ahsoka Tano (Rosario Dawson) and villains like Moff Gideon (Giancarlo Esposito). But from its very first episode, The Mandalorian’s third season took great care to illustrate that despite how unlikely a pairing Mando and Grogu might have seemed at first, taking in and protecting foundlings — orphaned children with nowhere else to go — is one of the most important aspects of Mandalorian society.\nThe idea that, after the destruction of their homeworld, the survival of the Mandalorians as a people was contingent upon their willingness to adopt young outsiders into their ranks has been present in The Mandalorian from the very beginning. But rather than simply restating that point or playing coy about the reality that Mando and Grogu have been father and son for quite some time now, The Mandalorian’s third season instead chose to emphasize other Mandalorian family units like Ragnar Vizsla (Wesley Kimmel) and his heavy infantryman father Paz (voiced by Favreau, physically portrayed by Tait Fletcher).\nThe point of spotlighting the Vizslas this season wasn’t just to give Grogu a pseudo-rival to best in play combat or to give Djarin a fellow hard-ass to butt heads with. It was to highlight how, in this time when different parts of the Mandalorian diaspora were fractured and in conflict with one another, unity and a collective reconsideration of The Way were the keys to their survival. You could clearly see these ideas being spelled out in the way Mando repeatedly took it upon himself to help the members of the Mandalorian covert on Nevarro who exiled him for removing his helmet in season 2. But it was through Bo-Katan Kryze (Katee Sackhoff) and her admittedly circuitous quest to retake the planet Mandalore (and rein in her fellow former Death Watch members) that The Mandalorian was able to unpack and explore these ideas most effectively this season.\nBetween following Mando and Bo-Katan to the Mines of Mandalore for a Mythosaur meet and greet, and their brief detour to the planet Plazir-15 to help Lizzo and Jack Black quash what definitely seemed like a droid civil rights uprising, it’s more than fair to say that The Mandalorian occasionally felt like it might have been veering off track. Occasionally, all the time the show spent showing us just how much work Greef Karga (Carl Weathers) was putting in to keep Nevarro safe felt like it could have been more evenly split with this season’s fleeting exploration of how figures like Elia Kane (Katy O’Brian) and Dr. Pershing (Omid Abtahi) have been moving through the world. But even with all of the unanswered questions left by the end of this season, those plots all made “The Return” a surprisingly satisfying finale because of how complete the episode felt by comparison.\nAfter two seasons of building up to dramatic reveals meant to shock viewers, “The Return” switched things up by playing out almost like the final act of a Star Wars film in which the ultimate avatars of fan id — a heroic squad of unique Mandalorians and villainous cadre of Stormtroopers in beskar-plated Mandalorian drag — have at one another in a series of epic action sequences.\nAs frustrating as it might have been to finally see the fruits of Moff Gideon’s labor — a big batch of fully grown, Force-sensitive clones of himself — only for Mando to kill them all before they got a chance to try out their powers, they were not the point of the episode. They definitely served to make Moff out to be an unscrupulous madman exceedingly willing to do anything necessary to gain power, and their presence immediately established the possibility of his having stored backups elsewhere we’re not privy to. Again, though, the clones weren’t really the point here, as was made evident by them being unceremoniously disposed of while the original Moff spent most of the episode strutting around in a ridiculously luxurious bit of Dark Trooper kit that called to mind both Captain Phasma and Darth Vader, depending on the lighting.\nIn the final episode of a season of The Mandalorian that’s spent so much time explaining how clinging to the past has both helped and harmed the Mandalorians, it was not in the least bit surprising to see the darksaber — a lightsaber with a blade made of… darkness — crushed. Mysterious relic though it may be, important lightsabers have been destroyed and reassembled in the past, and the darksaber’s true role in “The Return” was to leave no doubt about how primed for change Mando, Bo-Katan, and the other Mandalorians truly are at this point.\nThat openness to change is so deeply felt that when Din Djarin officially adopts Grogu in order to convince the Armorer (voiced by Emily Swallow, physically portrayed by Lauren Mary Kim) to let Grogu begin training to become a Mandalorian, everyone’s like, “Yeah, sure.” Of course, Grogu’s role in helping the Mandalorians reclaim Mandalore factored into their feelings about the unorthodox move to invite a literal baby into their ranks. But even in Din Grogu’s perplexing new name, “The Return” seemed to be making a very easy to understand point considering how breaking naming conventions is also a kind of change.\nIt’s perfectly fine to feel a bit disappointed that The Mandalorian’s third season didn’t explain every single thing that happened and wrap up all of its plotlines with a definitive finality. But that feeling should probably also come with the understanding that television shows like The Mandalorian — that is to say, popular, well-funded pieces of massive multimedia franchises — have a way of continuing, particularly when they so reliably get fans up in arms.",

            "text": "Following last week’s penultimate episode, the Star Wars community was a buzz with theories and speculations about how the season would end. Who is the other spy? Who is going coming to help save Din Djarin? What is Gideon’s plan for cloning? Are we going to see a Jedi come to the aid of the Mandalorians? Directed by Rick Famuyiwa, The Mandalorian Season 3 Episode 8 , answers all of these questions and more in what will likely go down as one of the most divisive installments in the Star Wars canon.\nThe Mandalorian Season 3 Episode 8, picks up directly after Paz Vizla’s sacrifice at the end of last week’s episode. As the Mandalorians led by Bo-Katan Kyrze attempt to regroup after learning of Grand Moff Gideon’s survival, his repurposing of Mandalorian technology, and the capture of Din Djarin the opening moments are undoubtedly tense. With so much made about who would betray the Mandalorians or would show up to save the day in the build-up to the finale, the first few minutes are waiting anxiously for theories to show themselves true or not. However, The Mandalorian Season 3 Episode 8 continues its trend of subverting fan expectations.\nThere is no Jedi savior. There is no New Republic rescue. There is no traitor. The Mandalorian Season 3 Episode 8 sees the Mandalorians be their own salvation, now banded together for the first time in decades under the leadership of Bo-Katan Kryze. Through Rick Famuyima’s directorial work, fans are treated to a plethora of exciting action set pieces that show the Mandalorians battling Gideon’s knock-off troopers. Despite all of Gideon’s efforts to create a new era of warfare for the Empire, he is woefully outmatched by the Mandalorians finally standing together. Throughout the finale, many of the characters that make up this new Mandalorian collective get their time to shine in the heat of battle. Even the Armorer and Axe Woves who many thought could be Gideon’s spies, solidify themselves as dedicated to the Way.\nRead Our Review Of The Mandalorian Season 3 Here.\nThe Mandalorian Season 3 Episode 8‘s title ‘The Return’ could not be more perfect. In the episode, fans see the return of the might of the Mandalorian people, vegetation thriving on the world of Mandalore, and most importantly the return of Din Djarin and Grogu working as a team. When looking to see how the series got here, it is important to take into consideration the groundwork from the early episodes. By expanding the scope past just Din Djarin and Grogu, the finale gives weight to The Mandalorian Season 3 Episode 8‘s biggest moments.\nIf not for the trouble it was for Bo-Katan and Din to bring the Mandalorians together this season, the closing moments surely would not have the same weight. Saying that Mandalorians are stronger together is one thing, but to have so many different views on the Way of the Mand’alor be at odds so often in Star Wars canon makes it becoming a reality even more daunting. However, through various character moments, the cohesion began to build until in The Mandalorian Season 3 Finale fans can see what it truly means to see a united Mandalore. Further, the expansion on the frailty of the New Republic opens the doors for more stories to be told that very well may include Bo-Katan Kryze and the rest of the Mandalorians.\nUnlike the finale of The Bad Batch Season 2, there is a sense of hope by the credits roll on The Mandalorian Season 3 Finale. It is almost as if this season played as the third installment in what would be a Dave Filoni and Jon Favreau movie trilogy with the finale evoking the end of Return of the Jedi. While the series’s titular villain may be defeated, it does not mean that there isn’t more for these characters to do. It is very likely that we will continue to see these characters’ stories bridge the gap between the Original Trilogy and the Sequel Trilogy. By splitting the focus between Din Djarin and Bo-Katan Kyrze, a door is opened to having their stories told separately with Bo-Katan as the rightful leader of Mandalore and Djrain and Grogu back to their own adventures.\nIf there is one thing that The Mandalorian Season 3 Episode 8 may falter on is also what makes it so much fun to watch. The pace for the episode is fast which is different than the slower burning pace the season has followed. The episode wastes no time answering all the questions fans have had throughout the season by jumping straight into the action. The action, while very well done and exciting, zooms by in the episode’s 38-minute runtime. I found myself wanting the conflict to last longer as we see aerial combat as we have never seen before in Star Wars live action. When the dust settles, The Mandalorian Season 3 Episode 8 attempts to wrap up earlier threads from the season to leave no stone unturned. Given the episode’s upbeat ending, the dash to the finish doesn’t feel as heavy as episodes like Chapter 22, but the intention to close the door on the season without a cliffhanger is evident.\nThe Mandalorian Season 3 Episode 8 puts a neat bow on an otherwise turbulent season for the Star Wars community. A happy ending doesn’t necessarily mean the end though. As Star Wars continues to expand its storytelling into more than just the story of the Skywalkers, The Mandalorian Season 3 can stand firm in its place as a conduit for this new era. The Imperial remnant of warlords is still a threat to the galaxy. With Mandalore on the cusp of a new age, the Mandalorian song can continue to be written with characters that have seen exponential growth this season. Din Djarin and Grogu have new opportunities to explore the galaxy together. More stories to be told means more Star Wars projects to look forward to and who can be mad at that?\nThe Mandalorian Season 3 Finale is available now, with new episodes of The Mandalorian premiering Wednesdays on Disney+.\nThe Mandalorian Season 3 Episode 8\n- Rating - 9/109/10\nTL;DR\nThe Mandalorian Season 3 Episode 8 puts a neat bow on an otherwise turbulent season for the Star Wars community. A happy ending doesn’t necessarily mean the end though.

            "text": "‘The Mandalorian’ Season 3 Finale Spoiler Review\nWARNING: SPOILERS FOR THE MANDALORIAN SEASON 3\nAfter a divisive season, The Mandalorian Season 3 finale is finally here, and will hopefully have you crying for different reasons than the Season 2 finale did. This season has definitely had its criticisms from the fandom, but whatever your thoughts are, the past two episodes have been some of the best Star Wars television. Unlike The Bad Batch Season 2 finale, The Mandalorian Season 3 had a happy ending. It wrapped up many loose ends and gave fans a satisfying conclusion. While I have been a big fan of this season, the show is truly at its best when the focus is on Din Djarin and Grogu, and these last two episodes have proven it. Even though Jon Favreau has confirmed that Season 4 is in the works, this would have been a great way to end such an excellent series.\nThe episode picks up where last week left off. The Mandalorians are separated. Din, being who he is, manages to get himself out of the hold of the stormtroopers. Grogu, in his new IG-12 armor, follows Din and helps him out of the bind. Bo-Katan is with another group, who are trying to fight their way out of the secret Imperial base. Din decides to go after Moff Gideon and end him once and for all. With the help of R5, Din, and Grogu are able to make their way to the base’s command center where they find clones of Moff Gideon. It looks like Doctor Pershing's cloning program actually worked. However, the fruit of his labor did not last long when Din decides to blow up the tanks the clones are in.\nRELATED:\nMoff Gideon confronts Din, and he is not happy. He was going to assemble the perfect army with his intellect that could also channel the Force. Gideon and Din fight with Grogu getting separated into a room with the three Praetorian guards. Grogu, being the child he is, literally gives the guards the runaround, evading them.\nMeanwhile, Din is not doing too hot in his fight against Moff Gideon, until Bo-Katan comes to his rescue. She fights Moff Gideon, while Din goes after Grogu. In a beautifully choreographed sequence, Din and Grogu fight the Praetorian guards together. They then meet back up with Bo-Katan, who is also struggling to fight Moff Gideon, especially after he breaks the Darksaber with his power armor. Yes, the Darksaber is unfortunately no more. He says how Mandalorians are weak once they lose their trinkets, but Bo reminds him they are stronger together, and indeed they are.\nDin and Bo team up and stop Moff Gideon once and for all. As we know with Star Wars, no one actually stays dead. Since we didn’t actually see Moff Gideon’s body, there is still a good chance that he is alive, and may return in the next season.\nIn the aftermath, Mandalore has been retaken, even though there is still a lot of rebuilding to do. A ritual for the foundlings takes place in the Living Waters, and Din officially adopts Grogu. The two head back to Nevarro where Greef Kargar gifts them a nice place to live. Din gives Greef Karga a gift in the form of IG-11, which has been officially repaired by the Anzellans. The droid will be the new Marshall of Nevarro. The season ends with a cute glimpse into their now peaceful lives.\nThe theories for the season finale were endless. Many thought Din was going to die, or that the mind flayer we saw earlier in the season would be used on him. While these things could still happen in Season 4, he and Grogu are safe for the moment. They have both been through so much and are now a family that has a happy ending. Other theories circled around the Armorer and her identity. Many thought she was Rook Kast from The Clone Wars or even a spy for Moff Gideon. It turned out that she is neither of those and just someone who wanted her planet back, with no ulterior motives.\nThis season, while a bit divisive, gave us some great Grogu moments. We finally got to learn who rescued him from the Jedi temple. He finally said his first words as well, just not in the way anyone pictured. This episode shows us how far he has come. While he didn’t spend too long with Luke Skywalker, you can tell he has learned quite a bit. He channels the Force multiple times throughout the episode and seems to be pretty good at it. It does not seem to take as much out of him as it used to either. It was wonderful to see such a beloved character, who started out as a bounty, grow so much this season, both in his body, and his skills.\nThere were a few instances where The Mandalorian theme played during the episode. The theme was changed a bit, with different sounds being added, depending on what was happening. It was an excellent musical choice for a finale. Rick Famiuya did a wonderful job directing once again. The entire cast was incredible, and Giancarlo Esposito really knows how to play those villains well. There was also a nice little throwback at the end of the episode, with Grogu using Force to lift a frog out of the water.\nAll in all, this was an excellent season that ended with an amazing, and satisfying, finale. It was everything Star Wars fans could want. It was a happy ending for two characters who desperately deserve it.\nRating: 10/10\nREAD NEXT:",

            "text": "The Mandalorian Season 3 Finale Ties Up Loose Ends And Sets Up The Future\nThere will be spoilers for \"Star Wars: The Mandalorian\" Chapter 24 – The Return.\nThe third season finale of \"The Mandalorian\" ends by tying up so many of the loose threads of the last three seasons, but also brings a new status quo, with a few unanswered questions remaining for future seasons.\nThe penultimate episode concluded with things looking grim for the Mandalorians who had come back to their home planet to take it back from the Imperials — led by the sinister Moff Gideon (Giancarlo Esposito) — who had been squatting there. Unfortunately, they walked right into a trap and were forced to sacrifice Paz Vizsla. Din Djarin (Pedro Pascal, et al) was captured and Lady Bo-Katan Kryze (Bo-Katan) was on the run, but there was still a glimmer of hope as Axe Woves (Simon Kassianides) was on his way to get reinforcements.\nNot missing a beat, this episode followed each of those story threads to its logical conclusion. Bo-Katan and her cadre of warriors trapped on the planet find safety in a secret, covert farm just beneath the surface of Mandalore until reinforcements arrived. Axe Woves made it to through the cloud cover to rally the Mandalorians in the air to support Bo-Katan in attacking Moff Gideon's base. Meanwhile, Din Djarin — with the help of Grogu — manages to escape his captivity and the two of them are led by R5-D4 to Moff Gideon's command center to have a final showdown with him.\nOn the way to that confrontation, Grogu and Din Djarin discover that the mysterious cloning tubes are full of Moff Gideon clones. Knowing they would be a threat, Din Djarin destroys the clones, angering Moff Gideon as they begin their fight. Din Djarin is no match for Moff Gideon and his Praetorian Guards, but Grogu arrives to help. And so does Bo-Katan.\nAs Grogu and Mando take out the Praetorians, Bo-Katan faces her nemesis.\nIn the sky, Axe Woves aims the crashing Mandalorian cruiser right at the base.\nMandalorians and Imperials flee the crashing ship, Din Djarin and Bo-Katan huddle together as Grogu uses the Force to protect them from the explosion, and Moff Gideon is consumed by fire. Mandalore is once again free and the Imperial Remnant has been thwarted.\nDin Djarin officially adopts Grogu and, as Bo-Katan and the Armorer work together to remake Mandalore, the pair of them put down roots on Nevarro, aiming to go on adventures to train Grogu in the ways of Mandalorians.\nForce-sensitive clones\nMoff Gideon's grand plan was finally revealed in full in this episode, showing that he wanted a cloned army of Force-sensitive warriors with which to rule the galaxy. The biggest revelation was that these clones were clones of him. Force-sensitive clones were a great difficulty to the Kaminoans, and this research really feels like it started on Kamino and through the work of Dr. Royce Hemlock, which is what we're seeing play out currently on the underrated animated show \"Star Wars: The Bad Batch.\"\nWe know where this is all heading, though. Snoke and Palpatine are the ultimate culminations of this technology, but it could also have a lot of ramifications for the future of storytelling in the universe of \"The Mandalorian\" and its timeline.\nForce-sensitive clones figure prominently in the story of Grand Admiral Thrawn and the original, now-Legends books starting with \"Heir to the Empire.\" A crazed Jedi clone, Joruus C'Baoth is a tool Thrawn wields against the heroes, and there's even a clone of Luke Skywalker who gets an extra \"u\" in his name, too, making him Luuke Skywalker. With Thrawn the name on the tip of everyone's tongue and him making his return known in the \"Ahsoka\" series, this storyline is likely vital to understanding what's going to come next on that show, which is interconnected both on the timeline and thematically to \"The Mandalorian.\"\nThe fate of the Darksaber\nOne of the more shocking twists this episode came as Moff Gideon, in his enhanced Death Trooper suit, crushed the Darksaber into oblivion. This is a weapon that has been revered by the Mandalorian people for more than a thousand years and held up as a sign of their leadership.\nWhat will happen to Bo-Katan's endeavor to unite Mandalore without it now? When Moff Gideon took it from her the first time, it ruined her ability to bring Mandalore back together. Was his breaking it a sign that he wanted to keep them divided?\nWhat Moff Gideon failed to understand, though, is that this new, more united Mandalore is stronger than ever and Bo-Katan even says it as Din Djarin and Grogu arrive to help her defeat Gideon. Will the Darksaber matter going forward? Or is its destruction a clever bit of symbolism that will end the infighting and challenged duels for leadership that have plagued Mandalore for generations?\nOnly time will tell.\nDetails to watch out for\nThere are quite a few little hints and nods to previous \"Star Wars\" installments in this episode. Some of it is very self-referential back to other, earlier episodes of \"The Mandalorian.\" One of my favorites came in the form of the bacta spray from Grogu. Assuming that Din Djarin was hurt and needed medical aid, badly, Grogu kept spraying bacta in his face. If you remember back to season one, this was how IG-11 saved Din Djarin in the finale story.\nAnother nod: R5-D4's booster jets and place in the story. R2-D2 set the mold in helpful astromechs in \"Star Wars\" storytelling, and his jump-jets were introduced in \"Attack of the Clones.\" Giving R5-D4 these jump-jets while giving him the classic R2 role was a nod to these moments. In \"Revenge of the Sith,\" R2 is capable of taking down a group of Super Battle Droids with his jump-jets and wits, but R5-D4 is foiled here by a cadre of Mouse Droids, sirens blaring. It's fitting for such a scaredy-cat droid and shows how much attention the filmmakers pay to the tenor of each droid's character and what they can handle. R2-D2 will take down a squad of Super Battle Droids, Chopper will straight up murder other droids and drop them out of an airlock, and R5 will just get scared away by Mouse Droids making lots of noise.\nDin Djarin dual-wielding pistols like Jango Fett felt like another visual nod to \"Attack of the Clones,\" which I think might be the most underrated \"Star Wars\" movie.\nA detail I found interesting in this episode was bringing Mandalorians back to their farming roots. This was territory that author Karen Traviss tread in her treatments of a united, post-purge Mandalore in the \"Legacy of the Force\" series of books. Those books are now Legends, but might give hints to what we can expect with the future of Mandalore itself.\nAnother flourish that calls back to classic cinema is the final shot itself. As Din Djarin and Din Grogu, Mandalorian master and apprentice, take to their pastoral digs on Nevarro, the camera irises out to black. This has long been a technique used in \"Star Wars,\" indeed, it's how George Lucas ended all of the theatrical movies. But this time, the iris out lingers and zooms off-center to Grogu. This feels like a nod to silent films and old cartoons, Charlie Chaplin sorts of stuff in this final moment of hope. Rick Famuyiwa, director of this episode, has made no bones about the influences that Charlie Chaplin's \"The Kid\" has given him in making this show, I feel like this is just one more bit of evidence of that.\nWhat comes next?\nWhat makes a satisfying ending? Is it a big spectacle of a fight? Is it the sacrifices that characters have to make? Is it the emotion it ultimately evokes? Is it the threads it ties up? Is it the surprises that come along the way?\nI think this season finale was mostly successful on all of those scores, but looking back on the season, everything seemed to work out pretty easily for everyone involved, without a lot of the twists, turns, and surprises that made the first two seasons so thrilling. This all played out fairly by the numbers. There's nothing wrong with that, per se, but it does give one some perspective and something to think about.\nFor me, the most exciting idea to come out of this season of \"The Mandalorian\" is \"What comes next?\"\nWith Bo-Katan working to rebuild Mandalore, there are certainly interesting stories to be had there and, frankly, I'd be surprised if we don't see follow-ups on that work on \"Ahsoka.\" Ultimately, this story is one that aims to tell us that we are better together and need to set aside our differences, but it feels so much more possible in \"Star Wars\" than it does in the real world. Perhaps that's why the ending felt a little thin to me. How do we do that? What truth did this story reveal about that for us to take to the real world? There are Nazis resurgent the same way Moff Gideon is bringing back the Empire, but the fundamentalists among us in the real world are egging that on, rather than agreeing that it's bad. So, maybe the ending felt more twee than it was meant to.\nAnd what of Moff Gideon's fate? It doesn't seem final. His augmented armor could have saved him from the blast, and the caches of clones that were destroyed don't feel as though they're his only ones. Could we see more of him in the future? I feel like it's a distinct possibility.\nThe other major story set up is Din Djarin and Din Grogu essentially becoming Nazi Hunters for the New Republic. That's an incredibly exciting prospect for me and gets the structure of that story gets the show back to the root of what made people excited about the show in the first place: Din Djarin and a baby, having adventures in the stars.\nIn the end, that can only be a good thing and we'll all be excited to see what comes next.\n\"Star Wars: The Mandalorian\" is streaming only on Disney+.",

            "text": "The Mandalorian Season 3 Episode 8 Review and Finale Ending Explained\nThis season of The Mandalorian has been widely disappointing so far, to say in the least. While there were some good episodes like Episode 2, 4 and 7, rest were either mediocre or bad. Bad is something we didn’t expect from The Mandalorian but Episode 6 was the absolute worst of the series so far. Anyways, I am happy to inform you that Episode 8 is quite literally among the best Mandalorian episodes ever made! So, read on to catch our in-depth review of The Mandalorian Season 3 Episode 8 aka the finale below but beware that some MAJOR SPOILERS follow below! Review Marathon – Episode 1 / Episode 2 / Episode 3 / Episode 4 /Episode 5 / Episode 6 / Episode 7.\nThe Mandalorian Season 3 Episode 8 – The Battle for Mandalore!\nRating – ★★★★★\nThe Mandalorian Season 3 finale did what the rest of the season failed to do – strike balance. For the entirety of this season Din Djarin and Grogu felt like side characters with nothing much to do, however, this episode corrects that. It perfectly balances the lead characters of Bo-Katan, Din, Grogu, and the Armorer and all of them get various moments to shine throughout the episode. It managed to connect all the events going on in the season and deliver a pretty satisfactory conclusion to almost every plot point and character arc. That aside, one of the best things about this episode was that it was visually stunning and was massively action packed!\nRight from the badass and action packed opening, its understood that this episode isn’t going to be a joke and it is here to leave a mark. As Din and Grogu make their way inside the base with R5’s help, Bo-Katan and her legions carry out the battle for Mandalore outside. The sequence where Armorer and Bo-Katan (holding the Dark Saber) lead the flying Mandalorian army to Gideon’s base is extremely chills inducing and takes us back to the glory days of Star Wars. Also, Din’s action sequences while he fought Beskar wearing Stormtroopers as well as the Praetorian Guards (Red Beskar Armor Troopers) were very well choreographed and finally gave Din moments to shine.\nBo and Din weren’t the only ones who got moments to shine as Grogu and Armorer also had some badass moments. Armorer totally dominated during the mid air battle sequences and I couldn’t take my eyes off her during that battle. And Grogu, he finally got his due as the support he provided to Din and Bo throughout the episode was incredible. In all seriousness, “You did good kid!” and during the battle’s final moments he proved himself to be a master of the Force by saving Din and Bo from the massive explosion. Moff Gideon once again proved himself as a worthy Star Wars antagonist as he defeated both Din and Bo Katan in one on one battles, and also destroyed the Dark Saber. It took two of the greatest Mandalorians, a semi-jedi, and a crashing Star Destroyer to take him down. What an absolute boss!\nThat said, the ending was pretty jolly and Pixar types as everything worked out perfectly and there were no losses of the heroes’ side. Then there was a bit cheesy re-ignition of the Forge sequence where everyone yelled “For Mandalore” as Bo-Katan stood tall. The purification ceremony where Ragnar was made a Mandalorian and Grogu was officially adopted by Din was pretty great though. Now as per creed, Din has to take Grogu on new adventures and train him as in apprentice, so here’s to wishing that Season 4 is more about the two of them than someone else. That leaves us with one of the most interesting subplots of this season which didn’t live up to it – the Mythosaur. Right after Grogu’s adoption to the creed we see a short sequence where the Mythosaur awakens but that’s all we got this season.\nWaking up of Mythosaur was symbolized with this new age of Mandalore and that was pretty much it. We expected a bit more from this legendary creature and we are sure it’ll be a major plot in The Mandalorian Season 4 which is already in production. Moving on to the final few moments, IG-11 is reconstructed which was a bit unrequired and Din decides to help the new republic indirectly. Also, Din is offered a residence at Nevarro which he happily accepts as a rest stop between the forthcoming adventures. Talking about technicalities, the VFX, cinematography, and production design were nothing short of perfection and the opening credits of this episode instantly made up realize “It’s gonna be epic”! And the action, oh my god, the action in this episode was just stunningly well executed giving us some of the best Star Wars battle sequences and hand to hand fight scenes ever!\nFinal Verdict – The final two episodes of The Mandalorian Season 3 really saved the otherwise mediocre season, which ultimately delivered fans an inconsistent but pretty great season of Star Wars live-action content. It proved to be pretty satisfying in the end and concluded almost all the plot points it established pretty well. However, if it learned how to strike balance a bit earlier, it could have been one of the greatest Star Wars thing ever made. Therefore, it ended up being the weakest season of The Mandalorian but with some of the strongest episodes in the series altogether!\nFinal Rating for the Season – ★★★★\nThe first 3 seasons of The Mandalorian are now streaming on Disney Plus. The Mandalorian Season 4 is well under way and is expected to arrive sometime in 2024!\nIf you have any questions regarding Star Wars, feel free to ask in the comments below.

            "text": "The Mandalorian Season 3 Finale Easter Eggs - 8 Things You Missed In 'Chapter 24: The Return'\nThis week on The Mandalorian, the Mandalorians try to take back Mandalore from their greatest foe, Moff Gideon; R5 gets to be a hero (again); and Grogu channels a particularly powerful scene from Rebels.\nWarning: This article contains spoilers for Chapter 24 of The Mandalorian, The Return.'\nThe Season 3 finale of The Mandalorian brings us the culmination of two storylines at once, with our merry band of Mandalorians making their final push to reclaim their homeworld while also facing off against their collective chief nemesis, Moff Gideon (Giancarlo Esposito).\nIn story terms, the finale was effectively the second of a two-part episode, and it picked up right where last week ended. The main group of Mandalorians has escaped Gideon's clutches and are hiding in the ruins of Mandalore. Gideon's army of beskar-clad stormtroopers is hot on their trail, while Imperial fighters attack the Mandalorian fleet. And the titular Mandalorian, Din Djarin, is determined to deal with Gideon once and for all, but that's not going to be easy with Gideon rocking a powered beskar suit--not to mention those scary Praetorian Guards he has hanging around.\nWhile the story will give you plenty to mull over as we end another season of The Mandalorian, this episode had some rather surprising Easter eggs as well--including one scene that features nods to four different scenes in three different Star Wars movies. Let's dive in.\n1. \"No, I'll take care of him myself\"\nEarly in the episode, Moff Gideon is looking at a map of his secret base with the location of the titular Mandalorian Din Djarin marked on it. \"Shall we engage?\" asks one of his new beskar-clad stormtroopers as Gideon puts on his helmet. \"No, I'll take care of him myself,\" Gideon replies, his helmet's Vader voice filter removing any question about whether he's making a reference.\nThis is a clear nod to Return of the Jedi, when Luke, Leia, Han, and Chewbacca are on the Imperial shuttle trying to sneak into Endor. During their clearance check, Darth Vader asks about them because he can sense Luke's presence. Captain Piett asks Vader if they should hold the shuttle, to which Vader replies: \"No, leave them to me. I will deal with them myself.\" And then he walks out of the room dramatically just like Gideon does.\n2. R5's rocket jets\nFive movies into the Star Wars franchise, near the end of Attack of the Clones, we learned that R2-D2 secretly had rockets in his legs the whole time, and for whatever reason never used them. It's apparently a standard feature in this brand of astromech droid, since R5-D4 casually flies around with his rocket feet in this episode.\n3. R5's exciting data port scene\nThe reason why R5 is flying around is because Din Djarin needs him to hack into the system and open some doors using his little data port phallus, pretty much echoing R2 on the Death Star in A New Hope opening the garbage compactor door for Luke, Leia, Han, and Chewie.\n4. Red laser doors\nAmusingly, the doors that R5 needs to open are themselves a different reference to a different Star Wars movie. Din Djarin is facing a series of red energy doors in front of him, and between each set of doors is a pair of beskar troops. While the troops are an original flourish, the doors recall the end of The Phantom Menace when Darth Maul used a similar set of energy doors to hold Obi-Wan back while he fought Qui-Gon one on one.\n5. Mouse droid\nJust as R2 was hassled by stormtroopers during his hacking attempt on the Death Star, R5 also runs into some problems with authority--albeit somewhat shorter ones. Instead of being interrupted by stormtroopers, R5 is harassed by a little mouse droid who makes the same beeping sounds as the mouse droid that Chewbacca roars at on the Death Star in A New Hope.\n6. Gideon clones call back to the original version of Thrawn\nGrand Admiral Thrawn is one of the only characters created in the old Expanded Universe to also exist in the current Star Wars continuity, but it's long felt as though they borrowed a few pieces of Thrawn's old story for Gideon on The Mandalorian, since he's been the most prominent figure from the Imperial Remnant that we've seen on screen.\nThis episode gave us one more borrowed piece. In the 1990s novel Vision of the Future, Luke Skywalker learns that Thrawn, who has been dead for a decade in that story, had a clone of himself prepared at a secret base who was intended to take power in the Empire if the real Thrawn died. Luke doesn't want to kill the clone--he's a new person and hasn't done anything bad yet--but he's eventually forced to flood the cloning chamber to escape, just as Din Djarin floods the cloning chamber to kill the Gideon clones on this episode of The Mandalorian.\n7. Grogu holds back the flames like Kanan\nAt the climax of the episode, Axe Woves crashes the wrecked Mandalorian cruiser into the Imperial base, killing Gideon. Din Djarin, Grogu, and Bo-Katan are about to be incinerated as well, but Grogu uses the Force to hold back the flames and keep his friends safe.\nWe've seen this trick before, on Rebels by the Jedi Kanan Jarrus. Though it didn't work out as well for Kanan. While he was able to protect his friends from the flames of an exploding fuel tank, he ended up dying for his efforts.\n8. Dave Filoni and Peter Ramsay cameos\nAt the end of the finale, Din Djarin pays a visit to his New Republic pilot friend at that one remote base to let him know he's open to jobs from the Republic. And, as was the case last time we had a scene here, Rebels and Clone Wars creator Dave Filoni is hanging out at the bar, easily recognizable with his signature cowboy hat that he always wears in real life. And he's actually chatting with Peter Ramsay, one of the directors on Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse. Ramsay directed Chapter 21 of The Mandalorian earlier this season.",

            "text": "How ‘The Mandalorian’ Lost Its Way in Season 3\n[WARNING: The following contains MAJOR spoilers for The Mandalorian Season 3 finale.]\nLike a jetpack running on fumes, The Mandalorian’s third season has chugged unevenly along for eight episodes — and as of the finale, some might say the show’s in dire need of a refuel.\nThe Mandalorian has always shone in action sequences, and if you were there for Grogu, he still snacks on weird stuff and does cute things at regular intervals. With that said, for the first time, the shine on the Star Wars franchise’s flagship show has started to tarnish. Here’s what we think Mando might’ve done better, and what we’d like to see from Season 4.\nThe Andor Effect\nYes, they’re different shows with different tones, different characters, and vastly different places in Star Wars canon. Neither is without a single pulled stitch. Nonetheless, good writing is good writing, so it merits saying; The Mandalorian suffered in comparison to its predecessor, Andor. Put the shows side by side, and the chips in Mando’s paint are evident. Andor managed to effectively utilize a large ensemble cast, giving every main character vital story beats and a meaningful arc. It was filmed on location rather than leaning into the sometimes tired-looking “volume”; its dialogue walked the line between realism and pure poetry. (“That’s just love—nothing you can do about that.” “I love him more than anything he could ever do wrong.”)\nSimply put, Andor showed Star Wars fans what the universe could offer; political intrigue, thought-provoking moral ambiguity, sets, and settings real enough to breathe. The Mandalorian’s third season didn’t measure up. Certain moments had the appearance of being obviously filmed on a set. More than once, the dialogue fell flat. Intriguing character arcs got smashed beneath the ever-tumbling boulder of the thin plot, and difficult questions remain not just unanswered, but unasked. Is Din (Pedro Pascal) ever going to grapple with the, um, complexity of belonging to a cult that won’t let him remove his helmet even to say goodbye to someone he loves? Season 3 couldn’t have pleased everyone in the galaxy, but it came up short when slotted right after one of the best Star Wars entries in recent decades.\nBo vs. Din\nTo be clear: The Mandalorian’s incorporation of Bo-Katan Kryze (Katee Sackhoff) wasn’t even in the same orbit as a bad idea. It would’ve been strange for the show to soar on without her — she’s a Clone Wars staple and a fan-favorite Mandalorian. Going into Season 3, however, most couldn’t have anticipated how Bo-Katan-centric The Mandalorian would become. In many ways, Season 3 was hers as much as Din’s. Again, not an inherently bad idea… but the execution led to an unfortunately glaring imbalance.\nSeason 3 of The Mandalorian offered little for its main character to actually do. No longer bounty hunting or attempting to find a Jedi to train his son, Din spent much of the past eight episodes getting saved, engaging in random firefights, kicking droids, and proffering a few vaguely motivational lines from beneath his helmet. Earlier seasons saw Mando develop and grow as he learned to both love and let go, but Season 3 didn’t give him much; his dilemma with the Darksaber was resolved shockingly swiftly, and his bewildering reunion with Grogu in The Book of Boba Fett nullified his heartrending sacrifice in the Season 2 finale. Din and Bo made an excellent team, but it would’ve been wizard if the season could’ve been a duet with Din Djarin singing the other half.\nScattered, Like Stars in the Galaxy\nEven judging Season 3 solely on its own merits, it’s still difficult to understand what the past eight episodes of The Mandalorian were about. The show spent its first half spinning its wheels and setting up a New Republic plotline that didn’t really go anywhere in the end — seriously, is Dr. Pershing (Omid Abtahi) safe? Is he alright? While Season 3 did eventually settle down and focus on retaking Mandalore, that wasn’t clear from the outset. Suffering from a serious lack of direction, characters tracked down multiple giant monsters and embarked on guest-star-studded side quests. The Pershing episode gave fans an illuminating glimpse into the destined-to-fall New Republic, but it also felt as if it had been yanked from a different program. Giancarlo Esposito’s Moff Gideon didn’t even show up until after the halfway point, in a sequence that felt more like a teaser for Ahsoka than anything Mandalorian-related.\nThe first two seasons had Beskar-solid goals. Season 1? Protect The Child. Season 2? Get The Child to a Jedi. Season 3 had no obvious goal or forward motion for too long, and the story sagged under that weight. If the whole season had been devoted to the Darksaber conflict, uniting the Mandalorian clans, and combining differing Mandalorian “Ways” and philosophies into a unified fighting force, the story might’ve felt less scattered.\nLack of Character Development\nAt the end of Season 2, The Mandalorian appeared to be setting up a third season that would shake its main character to his core. He’d lost his son and been forced to take the weapon that made him the (involuntary) leader of his people. For all intents and purposes, it felt like the start of a new hero’s journey arc: a reluctant, kindhearted “nobody” destined to banish the evil from his home world and bring peace to his people. Season 3 washed all of that away, reuniting Din and Grogu in a different show and passing the Darksaber to someone other than Din on a strange technicality.\nIt’s a symptom of a larger issue The Mandalorian has: it’s not all that interested in the inner life of its characters. Din never struggles with the weight of the Darksaber or whether his clan’s beliefs are the only beliefs worth adhering to; Bo gets some time to wallow in and explain her failures, but her season-long companionship with Din and Grogu never resolves into anything by the finale’s end; we still, three seasons in, don’t know who The Armorer is or why she’s so devoted to her Way; Moff Gideon was evil because he was evil, and now he’s (maybe) dead. For all the hullaballoo about the Darksaber last season and its symbolic vitality to the Mandalorian people, no one much seems to care that Gideon destroyed it.\nThe Mandalorian focuses so heavily on the awe-inspiring glimmer of Beskar that it sometimes neglects the humans and their human conflicts beneath. Hopefully, a smaller-scale fourth season that sees Din and Grogu go back to traveling the galaxy patches some of the tears evident in Season 3—and fills up the show’s coughing jetpack.\nThe Mandalorian Season 3, all episodes now streaming, Disney+",

            "text": "A plot twist that happened in The Mandalorian Season 3 finale turned out to be a major disappointment due to its importance throughout the entire series.\nStar Wars is known for having some of the biggest plot twists of all time - Darth Vader being the father of Luke Skywalker, Luke and Leia being siblings, and even Din Djarin's bounty in The Mandalorian's premiere being from Yoda's species.\nFor the most part, these out-of-left-field developments in the galaxy far, far away deeply resonate with fans and make the overall story that much more compelling.\nHowever, there are some instances where a major plot twist only brings disappointment.\nWarning - The rest of this article contains spoilers for Chapter 24 of The Mandalorian.\nMoff Gideon's Disappointing Clone Plot Twist\nIn the Season 3 finale of The Mandalorian, the reasoning behind Moff Gideon's obsession with cloning was revealed.\nAfter R5 opened the barriers leading to Gideon's command center on Mandalore, Din Djarin and Grogu entered a room filled with multiple pods that contained clones of Gideon himself.\nGrogu, who was noticeably curious about what he was seeing, even walked up to one of the pods, which resulted in a close-up shot of one of Gideon's clones opening its eyes.\nHowever, the scene ended as quickly as it began when Din Djarin destroyed all the pods at once, seemingly putting an end to all of Gideon's clones as well.\nWhen Din Djarin and Gideon then came face-to-face just seconds later, a plot twist revealed that Gideon was constructing clones of himself and making them Force-sensitive so that they could be more powerful than he ever was.\nThis plot twist disappointingly was revealed through expository dialogue from Gideon, and explained why he kept wanting to get his hands on Grogu throughout the show's first two seasons.\nAlso, just like the previous scene where the Mandalorian destroyed all of the pods, this plot twist and explanation of such an important plot point were quickly thrown aside when Gideon and Din Djarin began to fight.\nWhy Moff Gideon's Clones Were a Disappointment\nThe very first episode of The Mandalorian featured Din Djarin retrieving Grogu as a bounty for the Empire.\nMore specifically, Djarin was retrieving Grogu for Dr. Pershing, who was ordered to retrieve Grogu's DNA.\nAt the time, fans didn't know what it could be for, but it was known that Pershing was a cloning expert, leading many fans to believe that Gideon was all part of Emperor Palpatine's contingency plan to eventually return as a clone.\nIt was even theorized at one point that Gideon could have been the one to eventually create Snoke. That would have obviously directly tied The Mandalorian in with the sequel trilogy and also explained how Palpatine ultimately returned, which is something The Rise of Skywalker failed to do.\nThe first two seasons of The Mandalorian continued the trend of keeping Gideon's cloning obsession extremely mysterious.\nEven though his intentions were theorized and many believed The Mandalorian would eventually tie into the sequels, the Season 3 finale just proved that the entire plot point essentially built to nothing when Gideon revealed his intentions and then the twist was just cast aside.\nChapter 24 of The Mandalorian is available to stream on Disney+.",

            "text": "– Spoiler Review –\nThe Mandalorian Season Three Finale “Chapter 24 – The Return” brings lots of action and has fun doing it, but the ending doesn’t feel deserved as characters arcs are abandoned or left to fade to the background of a safe plot and a neat bow, leaving this feeling more like a series finale than just the season and me wondering if it needs to come back.\n“Chapter 24 – The Return” couldn’t help but feel safe the whole way through. Don’t get me wrong, Star Wars has and always will largely play it safe, be it the Rebellion defeating the dreaded Death Star (twice!) or taking out Palpatine once and for all alongside a fleet made up of the galaxy’s citizens, so if I have any issues with a safe ending like what The Mandalorian gets in its season three finale, it’s more to do about the narrative choices to get us there than anything else: Moff Gideon threatens to take care of Din Djarin and Grogu himself…only to wait until they undo all his plans first while standing in a convenient spot for someone to see them battling; the many cultures of Mandalorians just sort of continue being on the same side, no real dealing with their differences or past besides the battle over Mando Chess last episode;. And things look to reset to season one, the bigger plot all taken care of and wrapped in a tight bow. Sure, there’s plenty of things still out there story-wise like the Imperial Remnant and their Shadow Council, but the way the season would’ve rather spent a whole episode dealing with Paz’s kid taken by a monster than show us more of the big bad monster that should’ve been Moff Gideon, I question if it can truly handle bigger plots or threads in the era properly enough to have those be its focus.\nCase in point with Moff Gideon and how things all go down in the finale. In season one and two, he was an imposing villain, even if used sparingly like he was here, and he made an impact, be it injuring Din Djarin (forcing off his helmet) or taking Grogu, but the intriguing storyline of him being captured was left resolved off-screen this season, only for him to return in the final two episodes, with little impact other than a figure to unite the Mandalorians behind, and then end up dying anyways. He got a big moment in “Chapter 23 – The Spies,” taking Din and leading to Paz sacrificing himself for the others to escape, but in the opening minutes of “Chapter 24 – The Return,” the others get away and Din Djarin is freed by Grogu with relative ease. Why did Gideon want to keep Djarin alive? Vader keeping Leia alive makes sense due to the Empire’s hesitance to kill such a public figure (even if they blow up her planet afterwards), so was it to help capture Grogu to complete Pershing’s work on making Force-sensitive clones? How easily Djarin breaks free, with Grogu’s help, leaves the why behind it a giant question mark which never gets answered unfortunately and instead just feels like a convenience so these two could break free and be heroic.\nAnd Gideon, who often seems like the man with a plan, doesn’t feel like he had much of one here beyond over confidence, as even though he’s able to track Djarin and Grogu throughout his base and says he’ll go and deal with them…he waits in one place for them to come to him. Often big bads do this, sure, but the shock and anger over losing his clones (we’ll get into that later) doesn’t feel earned because, beyond the wall of troopers Djarin has to fight through, Gideon doesn’t really do anything to stop him, an especially jarring choice if he could’ve tracked Djarin’s movements and seen he made it through the initial gauntlet and to the clone room (maybe he assumed Mando wouldn’t do anything about the clones?). And the place he waits for Djarin and Grogu to find him? A giant hanger with a view, so that Bo-Katan, who later jets in with backup to take out the base, could easily see him and thus draw her in. Maybe it was part of his plan, he’s so confident he figured why not take out two of the biggest thorns in his side so he was trying to draw her in this way, but I shouldn’t have to do the narrative work for the writers instead of them doing it themselves, like showing us a character’s plans or motivations (no matter what they say about fans doing the work for them).\nWhen Gideon and Djarin face off, it’s a fun fight, but clear Gideon has the edge this time around with his new armor and the Praetorian Guards to mix things up. When Bo-Katan shows up, it’s a great moment, as it only seems fitting she should finally have her chance to take him down, while Djarin should be focusing on trying to help Grogu with the Praetorian Guards anyways. His fight with the guards to protect Grogu, who had previously been hopping around to avoid them but now he’s pushing them and their weapons around to help Djarin win the fight, was neat as well but the stakes never really felt like they were there, be it the pace of the fight or the inescapable feeling they wouldn’t be killing off Grogu any time soon. The same can be said for Bo’s fight with Gideon, the stakes felt absent but so too did the potential emotional aspect of the fight, as they don’t trade many words and their animosity with one another has largely all been off-screen, so them clashing here made for a great visual, but I didn’t feel any weight behind it other than a plot payoff. The Darksaber being destroyed, and Bo-Katan left unscathed, only aids the feeling there wasn’t much weight or deeper meaning to their fight, as they sort of tie but he perishes because Mandalorian’s are stronger together, Djarin helping keep Gideon at bay until…Axe Woves crashes their capital ship into the base, killing him for good. Thankfully before he passed, he was willing to share, Bond Villain style, his plans: his clones were his attempt to give his body the ability to use the Force, which we can all connect the dots as this being the early stages of the work perfected in the Sequel Trilogy, where a strandcast clone like Snoke or Palpatine’s new clone body are able to sue the Force. Gideon telling us what’s going on finally just before he dies is just one part of a far too neat bow on the series’ many storylines.\nDjarin hitching his flag to Bo-Katan? Well, that lasted about one episode as he seems to feel her song is written now, as the Mandalorians now control Mandalore and he must go off and have adventures with Din (??) Grogu, who is now his adopted son and a Mandalorian apprentice. That this happens without the two really sharing a word, just sharing a fight with Gideon, feels like an abandonment of their arcs together, as it would only make sense the two might have a chat before he goes off with Grogu, but rather…they don’t and them fighting together must’ve been all Jon Favreau felt they needed. We spent all season with these two building a relationship and the last meaningful conversation they have was in the penultimate episode, prior to them going separate ways? It seems like a big, missed opportunity. On top of that, the Mandalorians co-existing felt unearned last episode and continues to in this one, as they are all now peacefully united under the Great Forge being reignited by the Armorer and Bo-Katan. Fighting together to retake Mandalore certainly helps bridge gaps, between their ways, but the only meaningful work towards them getting over their opinions of one another was a fight over chess last episode, leaving this camaraderie at the end feeling too easy and unearned, as it can’t all go out the window this quickly. It leaves me wondering: will the show return to Mandalore and explore the culture’s resurgence? Or how the planet is able to begin sustaining plant life again? Or explore how they get along so well now? Or will this now just be a stop Djarin and Grogu will take every once in awhile and everything will be all fine and well when we check in? How does the larger galaxy, the New Republic even, feel about Mandalore being back on the map? Will the Imperial Remnant care enough to fight them or will that have to wait until the movie or a different show? If The Mandalorian has been any indication on how it’ll handle such threads so far, I’m fine if the answer to all these questions ends up being “all is well on Mandalore and with it being part of the galaxy” because I don’t think they have the ability for enough nuance to make anything more a worthwhile story.\nAs for Djarin and Grogu…they are Dins together! Wait…what? Adding unnecessary confusion, it turns out Din might be his last name? Or Din is like a title? And Djarin is his first name? Or Grogu gets the same first name to signify they are family/he’s Djarin’s apprentice? Why not just call him an apprentice, an upgrade from Foundling, and be done with it?! Well, I guess everyone’s going to call the little apprentice Din Grogu now, as even Greef Karga, who calls Djarin “Mando” in a camp full of Mandalorians, took the time to call him by his new name. Regardless, I did enjoy and connect with the moment of Djarin adopting Grogu, as it almost felt like we were on the brink of a season spent looking for Grogu’s parents (who I can only imagine are dead/they are hesitant of exploring more of his species anyways) if he didn’t, which sets them up to leave Mandalore and go have adventures again to train the newest Mandalorian Apprentice, Grogu. The show had issues trying to focus on such a big story of retaking Mandalore, taking breaks from it even in the final few episodes this season, so I’m looking forward a bit more to them returning to a series of adventures instead (though those weren’t always that strong either). Bounty hunting won’t give Grogu all he needs to learn, so Djarin finds a different source of missions: Captain Carson Teva!! If this is how they meld in the potential story of the likely cancelled Rangers of the New Republic, I’m all in, as more Teva and adventures with the New Republic at least could lead to some type of purpose behind the many missions instead of a series of random events. It’s definitely the main reason why I’d even want another season of the show.\nAnd it all makes sense they might head that way, as we now know Dave Filoni will be directing a New Republic film which will be the culmination of the storylines from shows in the Mando-verse, like this one (obviously), Ahsoka, The Book of Boba Fett, and otherwise. Because of this film, I imagine this is why “Chapter 24 – The Return” wrapped everything up so neatly, as it allows The Mandalorian to reconfigure and refocus towards building to the larger narrative instead. Yet at the same time, this episode felt like a series finale, Mandalore retaken and Djarin and Grogu set to go on adventures, though they have a cute little home to relax in on Nevarro now in between jobs, living a happy life and the evil they know about defeated (and the visit to Teva resulted in them find the missing IG parts and IG-11 is brought back to life as Navarro’s marshal). It’s the safe ending, as Star Wars likes to do, and I don’t have a problem with it, but it left me wondering: do we need to see more of their adventures? At this point, the answer for me is not necessarily, especially since the show didn’t quite give viewers enough reasons to want to come back or think a return of the show is necessarily needed. Do we want tons of more cute Grogu moments? Sure! Is it enough to keep The Mandalorian afloat for endless seasons? No. The Shadow Council and Thrawn and the build up to something bigger certainly warrant a return, but those are stories for other shows (and a film) it seems, so after this finale, there’s not enough to make viewers expect another season. And if they choose to wrap up threads or move characters forward in a different show, like they did during The Book of Boba Fett, and not really acknowledge it in the main show, why should fans return anyways if they can’t always be guaranteed to get the full picture? Only time will tell.\nHere are a few other things:\n- It’s sort of a silly thought, but now that the cult lives along the main Mandalorians, since no one has really seen their adult faces, what’s stopping them from taking off their helmets more? Beyond honor and their creed, of course? And even if they do, they just need to take a left, a right, and one more left and they are in the Living Waters, redeemed. Will the Armorer move the goalposts for redemption? If someone didn’t go into the Living Waters, despite how easy it so now, would the other Mandalorians accept them?\n- It was cool to see the Mythosaur again, which means the monster last episode was not the mythical beast, and I guess I’m glad it got to remain in its watery home and not have to be bothered.\nThe Mandalorian’s season three finale “Chapter 24 – The Return” had its fun moments but it only exacerbated the shows festering problems and proved new blood in the writer’s room or in the brain trust behind its story is desperately needed to keep this show fresh and exciting going forward. Maybe the upcoming film will be enough to center it, as the potential of tales of Grogu and Din Djarin helping the New Republic perks my interest a little, but The Mandalorian could end here at this point and I wouldn’t be disappointed, though not because it ended up satisfyingly, but because it hasn’t delivered enough at this point and this felt like a good enough place to end (and maybe let books or comics pick things up from here).\n+ Potential in the New Republic guided missions\n+ One big Din family!\n– Lack of stakes or emotional connection to many of its events and many moments feel unearned.\n– Discarding character moments for plot resolution\n– Doesn’t give a good reason to come back\nRyan is Mynock Manor’s Head Butler.

            "text": "The Mandalorian finishes a wildly uneven third season with a high-flying, action-packed conclusion. Chapter 24, \"The Return,\" clocks in at a lean 38 minutes and 56 seconds with a surprising lack of twists. Mando aka Din Djarin (Pedro Pascal), Bo-Katan Kryze (Katee Sackhoff), and a Grogu controlled IG-12 lead a united jetpack assault on Moff Gideon's (Giancarlo Esposito) secret Mandalore base.\nSuperb visual effects and production design coupled with blistering fight choreography enhances the straightforward narrative. Anyone hoping for an appearance by upcoming uber villain Grand Admiral Thrawn or Ahsoka Tano were sorely disappointed. The series keeps its focus on the primary protagonists and sets up a clear path for new adventures.\nThis article contains spoilers for The Mandalorian.\"The Return\" opens with Bo-Katan retreating through the base with her fighters. She radios Axe Woves (Simon Kassianides), soaring into the stormy sky for reinforcements, with new orders. Moff Gideon is alive. Evacuate the capital ship and use it as a diversion to save the others. She then collapses debris on the charging Dark Troopers. Meanwhile, a restrained Mando frees himself. He kills his two captors with a timely assist from Grogu. He asks Grogu to \"be brave\" as they must \"take out Moff Gideon or this will never end.\" Mando updates Bo-Katan that he and Grogu are safe.\nMoff Gideon's Clones\nBo-Katan's forces rocket through a breach in the roof. A squadron of TIE Interceptors flies into space to ambush the Mandalorian ships. In the control room, Moff Gideon dons his horned Beskar helmet. He'll personally find and kill Mando, who has the reverse agenda. He radios a nervous R5-D4 to tap into the computer system and \"find the command center.\"\nR5 hovers down to a lower lever, hacks a terminal, and dutifully forwards Mando the schematics. Axe Woves reaches the capital ship. He orders all forces to \"load the Gauntlets\" and regroup with Bo-Katan on the surface. The Mandalorians jet out of the hangar and into the drop-ships as TIE Interceptors zip by them. They open fire on the cruiser. Axe Woves single-handedly defends the ship as it reels from withering blaster fire.\nMando radios R5 to deactivate barrier shields \"one at a time.\" He has no weapons but fearlessly attacks the Dark Trooper sentries. Plowing through them like a beast as R5 lowers each shield. R5 is discovered by Imperial mouse droids but flies away safely. Mando and Grogu reach an ominous row of cloning cylinders. They're stunned to find Moff Gideon's clones. Grogu jumps back as a clone awakens. Mando overrides the control panel. The clones are killed as the cylinders explode.\nEpic Aerial Carnage\nThe Captain (Charles Parnell) and Scout (Charles Baker) lead Bo-Katan to a thriving cave. They cultivated gardens underground as \"life persists.\" Bo-Katan is hailed by the Gauntlets. Her forces rocket out of the cave to meet the reinforcements. In a spectacular scene, Bo-Katan ignites the Dark Saber as she charges with the flying Mandalorian army back into the base. Epic aerial carnage ensues. Bo-Katan and the Armorer (Emily Swallow) cut through a wave of Dark Troopers. In the command center, Moff Gideon confronts Mando and Grogu,\"My clones were finally going to be perfect.\" He reveals they \"were improved by the Force.\"\nThe boss fight begins. Mando and Moff Gideon viciously battle but new players enter the game. The fearsome, red-clad Praetorian Guards beat Mando down. Grogu draws their attention. Mando tries to help him but is dragged back by Moff Gideon. Grogu leaps out of IG-12 as it's cut to pieces. Bo-Katan arrives in the nick of time. She faces Moff Gideon, \"Go save your kid!\" Bo-Katan ignites the Dark Saber and strikes. Moff Gideon deflects her with a laser baton. Mando struggles against the Praetorian Guards. Grogu uses the Force to help him.\nThe capital ship plunges to the surface in flames. Axe Woves radios Bo-Katan. He's going to destroy the base. Moff Gideon's superior armor bests Bo-Katan. He crushes the Dark Saber and yanks off her helmet. Bo-Katan isn't fazed, \"Mandalorians are stronger together.\" Mando opens fire on Moff Gideon. On the bridge, Axe Woves shoots out the window and rockets away. The Mandalorian army soars from the base as the ship plummets down. Mando, Bo-Katan, and Grogu huddle together as a huge fireball engulfs them. Moff Gideon is burnt to cinders but they survive. Grogu uses the Force to shield them from the flames.\nPraetorian Guards\nDrums beat as the Mandalorians gather at the base of the Living Waters. The Armorer baptizes an apprentice while reciting the creed. Mando places Grogu at the water's edge to also take the creed. The Armorer deems him too young and cannot speak. He must \"remain a foundling.\" Only his parents can grant permission, \"if they are even alive.\" Mando adopts Grogu as \"his own.\" The Armorer writes in song \"that Din Djarin has adopted Grogu as his son.\" He is now \"Din Grogu, Mandalorian apprentice.\" Chants of \"this is way\" echo through the chamber.\nThe Armorer instructs Din Djarin to \"leave Mandalore and take your apprentice on his journeys, as your teacher did for you.\" Grogu looks into the Living Waters and senses the Mythosaur's presence. At the Great Forge, the Armorer gives Bo-Katan a flaming torch. Mandalore's leader lights the Great Forge to thunderous applause.\nMando and Grogu meet Captain Teva (Paul Sun-Hyung Lee) at the starfighter bar on Adelphi. Mando offers his services as a bounty hunter for the New Republic. He'll hunt down \"Imperial remnants\" as an \"independent contractor.\" Mando asks for a scrap assassin droid's head above the bar. On Nevarro, Greef Karga (Carl Weathers) gives Mando a deed to a new cabin. He in turn gifts the city a rebuilt IG-11 as the new Marshall. Mando sits on his porch relaxing. He watches as Grogu pulls a frog out of the pond.\nA Heartwarming End to Season 3\nDin Grogu has a nice ring to it. The bond at the show's center is formalized with a permanent home. It's a heartwarming end to a meandering season. You'll get no complaints here. Every episode looked incredible. Lucasfilm gets top marks for creating vibrant settings and delivering butt-kicking action. Showrunners Jon Favreau and Dave Filoni have years of The Mandalorian planned. There's an obvious effort to tie the series to the sequel trilogy.\nMoff Gideon's Force-sensitive clones are precursors to Snoke and the reborn Emperor Palpatine. The introduction of the Imperial Shadow Council, Commandant Hux, and Captain Pellaeon lays the groundwork for the rise of the First Order with Grand Admiral Thrawn as the initial leader. That storyline probably takes further shape in the upcoming Ahsoka. We'll see if Din Djarin and Din Grogu make an appearance there.\nThe Mandalorian is a production of Lucasfilm. All episodes are available to stream exclusively on Disney+.",

            "text": "The Mandalorian season 3 episode 8 (finale): How did it end?\nThe Mandalorian season 3 episode 8 served as the epic finale — but did it do enough to live up to the expectations out there?\nNo doubt, this season has been very much polarizing, and we’re sure that some will feel this way even after watching the ending. Yet, we are personally rather happy with how some of the loose ends tied up. While the season sputtered at times, it ended in a way that offered up some closure and also set the stage for some new adventures.\nFirst and foremost, note that Moff Gideon is now gone, and with that threat eradicated, Mandalore is now back in the possession of its people. Din Djarin decided that Grogu is now his full-blown apprentice, and with that, he adopted The Child as his own. That means that he also has the name now of Din Grogu, and the Armorer tasked the two to go off and have their own adventures.\nSo what will some of those look like? Well, we can at least say that Mando is willing to do some work (slyly) with the New Republic. Hence, the scene with Carson Teva at the end of the episode. He will do some missions here and there and we’ll see where this under-the-table arrangement takes the two of them.\nAlso, Mando has his own cabin now! Greef Karga gave the property over as a place for him and Grogu to stay between adventures. In a way the title hero is so much more settled and through that, the opportunity for freedom is there.\nYet, there was no jaw-dropping cliffhanger, and nor was there some mid-credits scene that teased Ahsoka Tano’s upcoming show. Maybe there was an expectation for more … but then again, you could say that about the vast majority of this season.\nRelated – Get some more news right now on season 4, including when it could premiere\nWhat did you think about the events of The Mandalorian season 3 finale?\nBe sure to share right now in the comments! Once you do just that, remember to come back for some other updates.\n(Photo: Disney+.)\nThis article was written by Jessica BunBun.",

It is part of the Star Wars franchise, set after the events of Return of the Jedi (1983). The season is produced by Lucasfilm, Fairview Entertainment, and Golem Creations, with Jon Favreau serving as showrunner.\nDevelopment on a third season of The Mandalorian began by late April 2020, and it was officialy confirmed that December. The season continues the Mandalorian and Grogu's storyline following the events of its spin-off series The Book of Boba Fett while also resolving several plot points established in the previous seasons; the season also promotes Katee Sackhoff as a series regular. Filming began by October 2021 and wrapped in late March 2022. Composer Joseph Shirley replaces Ludwig Göransson who composed the score for the previous seasons.\nThe eight-episode season premiered on the streaming service Disney+ on March 1, 2023, and ran until April 19, 2023. It received generally positive reviews from critics, with praise for the performances, musical score, direction, cinematography, and action sequences, but criticism for the writing and pacing, with some deeming the season weaker than its predecessors.

The ceremony is interrupted when a Dinosaur Turtle attacks the Mandalorians. The clan initially fails to defend themselves, but they are saved by Din Djarin and Grogu, who have been reunited.[a] The Armorer confirms that if the mines of Mandalore still exist, Djarin may become a Mandalorian once more. Djarin travels to Nevarro to meet High Magistrate Greef Karga. Djarin helps Karga stave off a group of pirates, led by the pirate Vane. Karga offers Djarin the position of marshal, but Djarin refuses, stating that he came to rebuild IG-11. Djarin successfully revives IG-11, but the droid defaults to his original, violent programming. Djarin brings the parts to a group of Anzellan mechanics, who tell him that they need a new memory core to repair the droid. As Djarin leaves Nevarro, the pirate crew led by Vane's superior, Gorian Shard, attacks his ship, but Djarin escapes. Djarin meets with Bo-Katan Kryze in an old Mandalorian castle on Kalevala, who reveals that after losing the Darksaber, she has abandoned her plans to reclaim Mandalore and tells Djarin to travel there alone.|\n|18||2||\"Chapter 18: The Mines of Mandalore\"||Rachel Morrison||Jon Favreau||March 8, 2023|\n|Djarin visits Peli Motto on Tatooine in search of a new memory chip for IG-11. She does not have one, but instead sells him R5-D4. Djarin, Grogu and R5 fly to Mandalore, where Djarin orders R5 to scout ahead and ensure that the atmosphere is non-toxic. When R5 does not return, Djarin ventures after it and is attacked by several Alamites, a native troll-like species living in the caves. Heading deeper into the mines, Djarin is captured by a cyborg creature and sends Grogu for Bo-Katan's help. Bo-Katan rescues Djarin and kills the cyborg before leading Djarin to the Living Waters. Djarin immerses himself to restore his status as a Mandalorian, but a sudden drop off causes him to sink deep into the water. Bo-Katan dives in to save him. On the way back up, she comes face to face with a Mythosaur.|\n|19||3||\"Chapter 19: The Convert\"||Lee Isaac Chung||Noah Kloor & Jon Favreau||March 15, 2023|\n|After Djarin recovers, he and Bo-Katan depart Mandalore, though Bo-Katan withholds the Mythosaur's existence from him. Upon returning to Kalevala, they are attacked by Imperial TIE squads, who destroy Bo-Katan's home, and are forced to retreat. On Coruscant, Dr. Pershing receives a pardon by the New Republic, but is startled to find Elia Kane—a former communications officer who was a part of Moff Gideon's Imperial remnant—among the amnesty program's recipients. Kane agrees to assist Pershing in his efforts to continue his cloning research, which has been outlawed by the Republic. They sneak aboard a decommissioned Imperial-class Star Destroyer to steal the necessary materials, but Kane betrays Pershing to the Republic's lawkeepers and later secretly sabotages the mind-wiping procedure used on him. Meanwhile, Djarin and Bo-Katan arrive at the secret Mandalorian enclave, where Djarin presents the Armorer with a sample of the Living Waters as proof of his redemption. Because she has also bathed in the Waters, Bo-Katan is welcomed to the enclave as well.|\n|20||4||\"Chapter 20: The Foundling\"||Carl Weathers||Jon Favreau & Dave Filoni||March 22, 2023|\n|Djarin introduces Grogu to Mandalorian combat training. Grogu wins a training match, but his opponent Ragnar Vizsla is captured by a large raptor. Bo-Katan gathers a hunting party, which includes Djarin and Ragnar's father Paz Vizsla, and leads them to the raptor's nest on foot. The Armorer forges a new piece of Mandalorian armor for Grogu, a rondel bearing Djarin's mudhorn sigil. As she works, Grogu has visions of his rescue from the burning Jedi Temple by Jedi Master Kelleran Beq and sympathetic members of the Naboo Armed Forces.[b] Vizsla's over-eagerness to save Ragnar disrupts Bo-Katan's plan and leads to a difficult aerial confrontation in which Bo-Katan and Djarin rescue the boy unharmed, kill the raptor, collect its chicks, and earn the clan's respect. As the Armorer replaces Bo-Katan's pauldron, lost in the scuffle with the raptor, Bo-Katan reveals her encounter with the Mythosaur, but the Armorer meets her account with indifferent disbelief.|\n|21||5||\"Chapter 21: The Pirate\"||Peter Ramsey||Jon Favreau||March 29, 2023|\n|In retaliation for Vane's expulsion, Gorian Shard invades Nevarro. Greef Karga contacts Carson Teva for help from the New Republic. Suspecting that the attack is a prelude to a new rise of the Empire, Teva informs Colonel Tuttle, but when Tuttle shows indifference, he tracks down the Mandalorian covert and asks Din Djarin for help. Djarin convinces the covert to come to Karga's aid despite their prior confrontations with him, and Bo-Katan assumes command of the attack force. As the Mandalorians overcome the invasion, Vane flees, Shard is killed, and the remaining pirates are detained. The Mandalorians are welcomed back by Karga and the people, and move back into their old enclave. The Armorer meets with Bo-Katan, acknowledging the Mythosaur's reappearance as an omen that Bo-Katan is the one who can reunite all Mandalorians, and bids her to remove her helmet to symbolize this new position. On his way back to Adelphi, Teva encounters the wreckage of Moff Gideon's prison transport, which had gone missing during transit, and finds a fragment of beskar alloy inside.|\n|22||6||\"Chapter 22: Guns for Hire\"||Bryce Dallas Howard||Jon Favreau||April 5, 2023|\n|Bo-Katan, Djarin and Grogu set out for the idyllic planet Plazir-15, where Bo-Katan's former army, now led by Axe Woves, have set themselves up as mercenaries. Before they can meet them, they are involuntarily diverted by the planet's rulers, Captain Bombardier and the Duchess, who ask for their help in neutralizing several repurposed but malfunctioning Imperial and Separatist droids. After stopping a rogue droid, Bo-Katan and Djarin follow its trail to The Resistor, a droid bar, and convince its bartender and clientele to help them. They discover that the droids were sabotaged through nanodroids in the bar's maintenance fluid, which were covertly imported by Commissioner Helgait, head of the planetary Security Office. Confronted, Helgait reveals himself as a Separatist before Bo-Katan knocks him out, and the Duchess sentences him to a pentinent exile on the Moon of Paraquaat. Granted an audience with the Mandalorian privateers, Bo-Katan challenges Woves for leadership and defeats him. To help her ascendance, Djarin admits his capture by the cyborg in the mines of Mandalore and his rescue by Bo-Katan, which rightfully bestows the Darksaber back to her.|\n|23||7||\"Chapter 23: The Spies\"||Rick Famuyiwa||Jon Favreau & Dave Filoni||April 12, 2023|\n|Moff Gideon is informed by Elia Kane of the Mandalorians' intent to retake their planet. Gideon relays this information to the Shadow Council, a group of Imperial remnant warlords. He requests reinforcements from Commandant Brendol Hux and questions Captain Pellaeon on the absence of Grand Admiral Thrawn. Reassembling on Nevarro, Bo-Katan unites the Mandalorian clans and prepares a recon party to explore the surface of Mandalore and locate the Great Forge. Before leaving, Greef Karga presents Din Djarin with IG-12: a rebuilt version of IG-11, which is able to be controlled by Grogu. On Mandalore, the group meets another surviving clan, who is loyal to Bo-Katan. Bo-Katan admits that she surrendered to Gideon shortly after the Night of a Thousand Tears, hoping that her people would be spared from further harm. The party finds the Great Forge but is ambushed by beskar-enhanced stormtroopers. Djarin is captured by a beskar-clad Gideon, who reveals his intent to complete the Great Purge of Mandalore. He attempts to kill the search party, but Bo-Katan uses the Darksaber to make an escape for the group. Paz Vizsla stays behind to buy time, but is killed by Gideon's Praetorian Guards.|\n|24||8||\"Chapter 24: The Return\"||Rick Famuyiwa||Jon Favreau||April 19, 2023|\n|Bo-Katan and her reconnaissance squad retreat from Moff Gideon's base. Upon returning to the Mandalorian flagship, Axe Woves sends the remaining Mandalorians to reinforce the planetary troops, while he defends the ship from Imperial TIE squadrons. With assistance from Grogu, Din Djarin escapes from captivity and seeks out Gideon. Djarin and Grogu discover cloning tanks filled with clones of Gideon who can use the Force, and Djarin destroys them. After a lengthy skirmish between the Mandalorians and the beskar-enhanced stormtroopers within the base, Bo-Katan, Djarin, and Grogu make a final stand against Gideon and his Praetorian Guards, in which the Darksaber is destroyed. Woves rams the Mandalorian capital ship into the Imperial base and Gideon is consumed by the resulting blast; Grogu protects Bo-Katan and Djarin from the blast with a force bubble. After the battle, the Mandalorians restart the Great Forge at the heart of Mandalore and Djarin formally adopts Grogu. Afterwards, Djarin takes up honest contract work with Carson Teva and moves into a cabin on the outskirts of Nevarro's capital, as previously offered to him by Greef Karga, while IG-11 is rebuilt by the Anzellan mechanics to serve as Nevarro's new marshal.|\nCast and characters[edit]\nStarring[edit]\n- Pedro Pascal as Din Djarin / The Mandalorian[2]\n- Brendan Wayne and Lateef Crowder as the on-set doubles for the Mandalorian[3][4]\n- Katee Sackhoff as Bo-Katan Kryze[5]\n- Din Grogu[6]\nRecurring co-stars[edit]\nOther co-stars[edit]\n- Amy Sedaris as Peli Motto[12]\n- Omid Abtahi as Penn Pershing[13]\n- Ahmed Best as Kelleran Beq[14]\n- Tim Meadows as Colonel Tuttle[15]\n- Jack Black as Captain Bombardier[16]\n- Lizzo as The Duchess of Plazir-15[16]\n- Christopher Lloyd as Commissioner Helgait[16]\nProduction[edit]\nDevelopment[edit]\nBy late April 2020, The Mandalorian creator and showrunner Jon Favreau had been writing a third season for \"a while\" and further development on the season was beginning.[17] That September, co-star Giancarlo Esposito said the second season would \"start to lay the groundwork for the depth and breadth that's going to come in season 3 and season 4, where you're really gonna start to get answers.\"[18] After the second-season finale announced The Book of Boba Fett for December 2021, commentators speculated that the third season would be shifting focus from Din Djarin, The Mandalorian, to Boba Fett. Favreau soon clarified that The Book of Boba Fett was a separate spin-off series that was already in production in December 2020, with the third season of The Mandalorian again focusing on Djarin. He added that the third season was in pre-production, and filming would begin in 2021.[2] Bryce Dallas Howard,[19] Rick Famuyiwa,[20] and co-star Carl Weathers all directed episodes after doing so for previous seasons,[7] with Famuyiwa also being promoted to executive producer.[20] Lee Isaac Chung, Peter Ramsey, and Rachel Morrison all directed episodes of the season.[21]\nWriting[edit]\nFavreau wrote all eight episodes of the season, working with Noah Kloor on the third and Dave Filoni on the fourth and seventh episodes.[22][23] The season picks up after the events of The Book of Boba Fett (2021), with the Mandalorian and Grogu traveling to Mandalore so Din Djarin can redeem himself for his transgressions of removing his helmet.[6][24] Discussing the absence of Cara Dune in the season following the firing of actress Gina Carano, Famuyiwa said the character was still \"a big part... of the world\" and that Favreau took the time to address her absence. However, the creatives knew \"the heart of the show\" was Din Djarin and Grogu with Filoni stating the season was \"mainly dealing with Mandalorians and the Mandalorian saga, the Mandalorian tale\", and how that affects the duo's story.[25] Famuyiwa stated the season would resolve a number of plot points established in the previous Mandalorian seasons as well as in the spin-off series The Book of Boba Fett, particularly in the final two episodes,[26][27] concluding the first chapter of these connected stories. The season would also plant seeds as to where the connected storyline was heading.[26]\nCasting[edit]\nPedro Pascal stars in the series as The Mandalorian.[2] The Mandalorian is also portrayed by stunt doubles Brendan Wayne and Lateef Crowder, with Wayne and Crowder receiving co-star credit for the first time in the third season.[3][4] In November 2020, Esposito said he expected to be featured more prominently in the third season than previous ones.[28] Also returning are Carl Weathers as Greef Karga,[7] Katee Sackhoff as Bo-Katan Kryze,[5] Emily Swallow as The Armorer,[6] Amy Sedaris as Peli Motto,[29] Omid Abtahi as Penn Pershing,[13] Simon Kassianides as Axe Woves, and Mercedes Varnado as Koska Reeves.[9] Katy O'Brian co-stars as Elia Kane, reprising the role from the second season,[8] while Ahmed Best co-stars as Jedi Master Kelleran Beq; Best originated the role on the children's game show Star Wars: Jedi Temple Challenge.[14] Paul Sun-Hyung Lee also reprises his role as Carson Teva,[6] as does Tait Fletcher as the Mandalorian Paz Vizsla, with the character voiced by Favreau.[10] In March 2022, Christopher Lloyd was revealed to be a guest star for the season,[30] as Commissioner Helgait,[16] and in May 2022 it was revealed that Tim Meadows would appear in the season,[6] as New Republic Colonel Tuttle.[15] Jack Black and singer Lizzo co-star as Captain Bombardier and his wife The Duchess, respectively, of the planet Plazir-15.[16]\nAlso starring in the season are Temuera Morrison reprising his role as the voice of the clone troopers,[31] Steve Blum reprising his role as the voice of Rebels character Garazeb \"Zeb\" Orrelios, and directors Deborah Chow, Rick Famuyiwa, and Dave Filoni reprising their roles as New Republic pilots Sash Ketter, Jib Dodger, and Trapper Wolf, respectively.[15] Brian Gleeson and Xander Berkeley appear as Brendol Hux and Gillad Pellaeon two Imperial warlords and members of the Shadow Council. Jonny Coyne, Jodi Long, Hemky Madera, Ron Bottitta, Marco Khan and Imelda Corcoran appear as additional warlords.[32]\nFilming[edit]\nFilming for the season began by October 13, 2021,[33] with David Klein serving as the cinematographer.[34] It had previously been expected to begin once filming for The Book of Boba Fett completed in June 2021,[2][35] but was unable to then because Obi-Wan Kenobi was using the Los Angeles soundstages.[35] Esposito noted that the production did not need to wait for Pascal to complete filming the HBO series The Last of Us since the Mandalorian is primarily seen with his helmet on.[11] Regarding filming the season during the COVID-19 pandemic, Favreau felt The Mandalorian was in an advantageous situation since many characters are in masks and the series employs \"a lot of digital work that augments things\", allowing the production to be flexible to adhere to filming protocols.[36] Filming wrapped on March 29, 2022.[37] Reshoots occurred in early July 2022.[38]\nMusic[edit]\nIn February 2023, Joseph Shirley was revealed to be composing the score for the season, replacing Ludwig Göransson. Shirley previously provided additional music for the first two seasons and used Göransson's themes to compose the score for The Book of Boba Fett.[39] A soundtrack featuring selections from the first four episodes of the season was released digitally by Walt Disney Records on March 29, 2023.[40] An album featuring selections from the last four episodes was released on April 21, 2023.\n|No.||Title||Length|\n|1.||\"The Living Waters\"||3:27|\n|2.||\"The Apostate\"||1:58|\n|3.||\"High Magistrate\"||3:41|\n|4.||\"We Got Pirates\"||3:24|\n|5.||\"A Castle\"||3:34|\n|6.||\"Back for a Tune Up\"||2:12|\n|7.||\"Mando's in Trouble\"||4:35|\n|8.||\"The Old Mines\"||3:02|\n|9.||\"I Swear on My Name\"||2:31|\n|10.||\"Attack on the Gauntlet\"||5:27|\n|11.||\"Amnesty Scientist\"||4:05|\n|12.||\"Coruscant Street Fair\"||3:33|\n|13.||\"Worth the Risk\"||2:02|\n|14.||\"L52\"||3:26|\n|15.||\"You Are One of Us\"||3:55|\n|16.||\"Playtime's Over\"||3:58|\n|17.||\"There Are No Others\"||5:39|\n|18.||\"Quest for a Foundling\"||5:09|\n|19.||\"Double Signet\"||1:44|\n|Total length:||67:00|\n|No.||Title||Length|\n|1.||\"Adelphi Jukebox\"||1:47|\n|2.||\"Imperial Thinking\"||3:12|\n|3.||\"Siege on Navarro\"||5:45|\n|4.||\"Open Fire Below\"||2:24|\n|5.||\"Walk the Way Together\"||2:04|\n|6.||\"All's Fair in Love and War\"||3:37|\n|7.||\"Plazir Royal Hall\" (feat.

            "text": "‘The Mandalorian’ Season 3 Finale Takes the Easy Way Out | Review\nThe final showdown feels like someone desperately wanted to rekindle the magic of The Last Jedi’s throne room scene—complete with Praetorian Guards—without fully understanding why that scene stands out as a fan favorite.\nCalling anything in TLJ a \"fan favorite\" is a bit of a stretch.\nAfter all the back and forth about the Darksaber since Din won it in Season 2, it’s tossed aside and destroyed by Moff Gideon, largely undermining three series—including the animated ones—that built up its importance to the Mandalorians.\nSigh Tell me you haven't been paying attention, without telling me. The whole point has been that the Darksaber itself is meaningless, it's about the story, about proving your strength. Regardless of the Darksaber, the entire season has been building the idea that the focus on individual strength and pride has been Mandalore's downfall from the start, and that Mandos need to abandon the \"I'm tougher than you\" bravado and band together in order to win.\nThroughout most of the season, The Armorer (Emily Swallow) has regarded Din as Grogu’s father, however, it seems he wasn’t really his father. After Ragnar (Wesley Kimmel) is rebaptized in the waters of Mandalore—with no mention of his recently deceased father or why he needs to take the Creed again—Din attempts to have Grogu made his apprentice, instead of just his foundling. The Armorer points out that he’s still too young to take the Creed (which was already established earlier in the season) and makes a comment about requiring his parent’s permission to allow Din to take it for him. This makes no sense, considering how many Mandalorians are brought in as orphaned foundlings. To this roadblock, Din decides to bypass it by adopting him (which, isn’t that what the whole foundling thing already was?) and The Armorer allows it, giving Grogu… Din’s first name.\nAgain, not really paying attention. Grogu was under Djarin's protection, but was not his kin. Foundlings are cared for collectively by the clan, and his mission was to return the Child to his people, remember?\nRagnar was never baptized, the Space Alligator interrupted the ceremony.\nDespite the well-documented and The Mandalorian contemporary knowledge that Mandos use family names—like Bo-Katan Kryze, Paz Viszla, and even Sabine Wren—The Armorer does not name the kid Grogu Djarin.\nDin Djarin is not a native Mandalorian, he's from Aq Ventin. Maybe they have different naming conventions there. I bet Maggie here complains that in Mulan they call her Fa Mulan instead of Mulan Fa.\nit also largely undermines what The Mandalorian attempted to do by showcasing the New Republic’s corruption and inadequacies mere episodes ago. All cops are bad cops until Din Djarin decides he’s going to be their personal bounty hunter, apparently.\nDid Maggie forget all the setup starting in Season 1 of Captain Teva helping Mando? He saved his ass from the ice spiders back during Frog Lady episode. He tried to get the NR to help Navarro, and enlisted the Mandos when they wouldn't. Teva has been portrayed as a good cop trying desperately to fight against a corrupt system the entire time. Mando doesn't want to help the NR, he wants to fight the Remnant and help Teva.\nDin collects a junked IG-11 unit from Carson to get the Anzellans on Nevarro to once again revive the dead droid. But wait! He’s not just a droid—he’s the new Marshall! Because apparently on Nevarro they’ll let just anyone become one.\nOk that was a little weird, fair is fair.\nThe Mandalorian thinks it’s clever by paying off Greef Karga’s (Carl Weathers) offer to give Din land to settle on, which he doled out in the finale, but it seems to forget that the debt was paid already when Greef granted the Mandalorians land and asylum a mere handful of episodes ago.\nI mean, not really. There's a difference between granting some land as a reward for helping save the city, and a personal gift to an old friend. Just because he helped the Mandalorians as a whole doesn't mean Karga doesn't still feel indebted to his friend for helping him in the past.\nThis \"review\" takes the easy way out. It's like she hasn't bothered to actually pay attention to the story at all.\nThanks for your nuances breakdown of the review here!\nI admit Mando was not, in fact, the absolute pinnacle of television everrr, but we should also not necessarily be judging it based on Andor or maybe Breaking Bad, as those are different shows with different goals and audiences. Seems some people forget that.\nI think the Lorehounds said it best: the Mandalorian works best if you put on your jammies, have some cereal and blue milk with Syril, and treat it as kind of a pretty good Saturday morning cartoon show. You know, just enjoy the show rather than expecting something deep or groundbreaking. That’s Andor’s job.\nIt was fun, I was basically never bored, it added to the lore of Star Wars in a way that doesn’t destroy my entire childhood (snicker), and we got to see some big picture stuff that we can expect will be addressed in another show. I’d honestly be fine if they ended the series here; it’s a great place to stop. Maybe Mando makes a few appearances elsewhere like in Ahsoka but mostly goes on his way doing bounties for Teva and helping keep Nevarro safe.\nUltimately, this show proved that fun stories can be told in the Star Wars universe that aren’t related to the Skywalker family, and don’t necessarily have galaxy-wide major plot requirements. We got glimpses into the greater galaxy, but almost explicitly saw stories centered around a few outer rim planets, small(ish) stakes stuff. And that, ultimately, appears to have been the purpose of this show, and that’s fine!\nI find it really funny that Gideon’s force-sensitive clones - the reason he put the bounty on Grogu which kicked off the whole series - were given one scene and dealt with in about two minutes.\nIt would definitely have been better to get more than just a couple lines of exposition about them. I assume the research was saved somewhere and is later used to help bring Palpatine back, somehow. It would actually be worthwhile if that tidbit is tied together somehow in the Ahsoka series, thus showing how Grogu was important to the Remnant altogether and maybe the early First Order and the plot of Rise of Skywalker rather than the handful of glimpses we got in these three seasons.\nYep. They're giving us a lot of cool/emotional moments without any build whatsoever. Like, maybe 5 of the total actors in Mandalorian armor during all this even had names, which says a lot because this is Star Wars - a franchise obsessed with giving every single background character a story in case you want to market them later. IDGAF about any of these people, though, so their fighting & dying means nothing. They did the same shit with Book Of Boba Fett, too. Buncha people in a rush to do nothing, pointless action, lots of verbal saber-rattling, a plot that makes no sense, and scripts that get increasingly more ridiculous with each episode.\nYeah when the big Mando jetpack fight happened I kind of checked out instantly because I realized none of the Mandos or Dark Troopers fighting in the sky were like... actual characters. It was just visual noise.\nYeah, generally I must agree. We got a poorly-written season, and it was capped off with a paint-by-numbers conclusion that didn't take any real chances or deliver impactful moments.\nUltimately, this season had as much planning as the Sequels did. It lacked a consistent threat, and in the end brought back the same guy who was defeated twice in a row but this time... are you ready? His helmet has spikes, which can only mean he's more threatening than before.... and bam, he was defeated in 2 episodes.\nWho do you think will deliver the \"somehow Gideon returned\" line next season?\nWell they left that completely open with the reveal he cloned himself. They can take a decision based on how much Esposito wants & if he comes back make him a force wielding enemy this time for Grogu who, I imagine by the end of season 4 would be a Mythosaur taming dark sabre wielding Mando-Jedi.\nThis article was well articulated. He brought up many points that I never realized were part of the reason why I wasn’t that fond of Mandalorian Season 3. The ending, while satisfying, did bring many questions and made many of the highly anticipated things worth less than we perceived. This quote stood out to me: “For fans of The Clone Wars, this was decades in the making, and it was treated as little more than a footnote in the race to the credits.”\nThis article makes some good points. I especially agree about the Darksaber and the inconsistent aspects of taking the creed. But I’m a fan and not a critic getting paid, so the episode was entertaining enough and somewhat emotional at the end. Grogu holding back the fire really hit me for some reason.\nI think the Darksaber needed to be broken so that Grogu can make his own mini version, they couldn't have two in circulation at the same time. Grogu seems to be to be obviously treading the same path as the first king of all Mandalore who was Jedi & Mandalorian & tamed the Mythosaur. So at some point he's going to have a dark sabre to go with his Jedi powers.\nWhile \"The Return\" was a good name for this season ending chapter, it really should have been titled POWER SLIIIIDEEE\nWhile far from a perfect season or finale, I found the show to be fun and enjoyable. It’s no Andor. It’s no Mad Men. I think the Lorehounds gang said it best that this show works when you treat it like a Saturday morning cartoon (like Rebels), rather than trying to take it too seriously. (Eating blue milk and cereal with Syril!)\nThe review felt especially nitpicky and didn’t even get some basic details right (ie, Ragnar had to redo the ceremony because the first time he got interrupted by a gigagator and then got eaten by a megapteradactyl, poor kid got no breaks; even his father died!), and the author seems to fail to understand the purpose of The Mandalorian overall.\nThe plot had some holes and felt rushed. Some, like the clone exposition could be redeemed in the future, like if Gideon’s research goes on to help the Remnant/First/Final Order to somehow bring about Palpatine’s return. Gideon was much more mustache twirling than in the previous seasons where he was actually quite terrifying and markedly competent compared to The Client (Werner Herzog’s deliciously creepy character), and his limited screen time felt rushed, rather than building on what had appeared to be cunning and tact, much like the overall plot, being honest. Some extra time for villain character development would have been better but it wasn’t exactly terrible.\nI am split about the Darksaber. Seems like it was such a big deal, such a unique item and super cool to see in live action, but at the same time, it’s destruction means Mandalorians must, as Bo-Katan and Din Djarin said, unite together based mutual respect, not because someone holds a holy Macguffin. Supreme executive power derives from a mandate from the masses, not from some farcical aquatic ceremony!\nOverall, the Mandalorian was fun. It’s family friendly. Grogu is adorable and Carl Weathers is a joy to watch. The Mandos’ acting without facial expressions was very well done. The tie-ins with characters from the cartoons was largely cool, but was mostly still accessible to those who haven’t watched them. Its plot taking place out in the Outer Rim means it’s low stakes compared to the Big Game stories that deal with the Skywalker family, the Jedi, or major galactic events as Ahsoka surely will.\nI’d give the show a solid 4/5, and I hope the Din family can get some rest in their newly acquired country home for a bit to give their story either closure or at least breathing room.\nAbout Community\nMembers\nOnline\nTop 1%\nRanked by Size",

Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight play Play now NaN min Follow on Podcast episode Spotify Apple Google Amazon Wednesday’s episode wrapped up old plotlines and cleared tons of room for new ones. The beloved Din Djarin (Pedro Pascal) and Grogu (Baby Yoda) defeated their past demons and found somewhat of a happy ending. The pair are now free from a villain that had been driving their stories for years, as well as the crusade to take back the planet Mandalore with Bo-Katan. For the first time since the show’s pilot episode, there is no clear path ahead. But we know there will be  something. Advertisement The new series  “Ahsoka”  will drop on Disney Plus in August. That show will detail the journey of Ahsoka Tano (Rosario Dawson), the former Padawan learner of Anakin Skywalker who first appeared in “The Clone Wars” animated series. Ahsoka made her live-action debut in “The Mandalorian” Season 2, where she revealed she was searching for Grand Admiral Thrawn (Lars Mikklesen), who may be trying to revive the Empire. The teaser trailer for “Ahsoka” that dropped nearly two weeks ago shows Ahsoka teaming up with characters from the animated “Star Wars Rebels” show in her search for Thrawn. Though “Ahsoka” will probably center on the titular heroine’s search for Thrawn and Ezra Bridger (a character from “Rebels” who disappeared with Thrawn in that show’s series finale), it wouldn’t be all that surprising if the series gave fans hints as to what’s next for Grogu and Djarin, given that Ahsoka seems to play a role in  the bigger Star Wars story  that Dave Filoni and Favreau are telling across multiple projects. Another show produced by the pair is expected to hit Disney Plus sometime this year, too, though an official launch date hasn’t been announced. “Skeleton Crew” is  set to take place  around the same time as Season 1 of “The Mandalorian,” focusing on kids lost in space and starring Jude Law. Advertisement A third season of  “The Bad Batch,”  an animated series that’s focused on clone troopers who did not listen to the Empire’s commands, was announced by  Lucasfilm  this month. That show — which takes place roughly 40 years before “The Mandalorian” — has a number of Easter eggs that tie into the “Mando-verse,\" specifically around cloning and the rise of the Empire. Though viewers may not get specific answers about what is happening to Grogu or Djarin, the show’s third season could add more context to rewatches of “The Mandalorian.” Grogu, also known as Baby Yoda, is the breakout star of the hit show \"The Mandalorian.\" Psychologist Stephan Hamman explains why humans are drawn to him. (Video: Allie Caren/The Washington Post) And the new  Star Wars  series “Acolyte” is still in development. It will focus on the High Republic era and the rise of the Sith. This show will likely have more connections to newer Star Wars novels on the High Republic era, which takes place decades before the prequel trilogy. Advertisement Naturally, a  fourth season of “The Mandalorian”  appears to be in development already. Favreau has suggested there is no planned ending for the show in sight. “I love for these stories to go on and on,” Favreau told  Total Film magazine  before the third season began. “And so these characters could be with us for a while. I really love telling stories in their voice, and I love the way the adventures unfold and I’m looking forward to doing much more.” Disney and Lucasfilm announced this month  that many of the Disney Plus shows — “The Mandalorian,” “The Book of Boba Fett” and the forthcoming “Ahsoka” series — will lead into a new Star Wars film directed by Filoni, which is likely to be released in 2026. The film is untitled, and there are no direct details about it, but both “The Mandalorian” and “Ahsoka” heavily hint that Thrawn may be the film’s “big bad” and that fans may see an “Avengers”-style team-up of Ahsoka, Djarin, Grogu, Boba Fett and so many more heroes from the Disney Plus shows to take him down. Fans can also expected to see Daisy Ridley return as Rey in a new Star Wars movie in 2025. For now, fans are left to think about “The Mandalorian” finale and the doors it leaves open. Answers — like the twin suns of Tatooine — remain on the horizon. Disney did not make talent available for interviews ahead of the finale.  Comments GiftOutline Gift Article View more Loading...

            "text": "Summary\nAn action-packed finale provides very few twists but delivers a fair amount of payoff — and also suggests a new future for Mando and Grogu.\nThis recap of The Mandalorian Season 3 Episode 8, “Chapter 23: The Return”, contains spoilers, and the article contains a full breakdown of everything that occurs during The Mandalorian Season 3’s ending.\nWell, folks, we’ve made it to another season finale of The Mandalorian, which is historically cause for the entire internet to break down into sobs of uncontrollable nostalgic frenzy.\nHowever, rightly or wrongly, this season has focused less on that sort of thing and more on a coherent redemption arc for the Mandalorians as a people, trying to reclaim their homeworld from the grip of tyranny and unite their fractured culture. In Episode 7, that fight went home to Mandalore, where Bo-Katan and the united Nite Owls and Children of the Watch discovered that Moff Gideon, on behalf of an Imperial Shadow Council, had been using the planet as a base of operations for the return of Grand Admiral Thrawn and something dubbed Project Necromancer.\nThe Mandalorian Season 3 Ending Explained\nThis is where we pick things up, with a fight on two fronts: Bo-Katan and other surviving Mandalorians who escaped Moff Gideon’s ambush trying to evacuate the Mandalorian fleet before the Imperial Remnant destroy it, and Mando, Grogu (in his new IG-12 mech), and R5-D4 trying to break into Moff Gideon’s control center and bring his longstanding crusade to an end.\nWhat is Moff Gideon doing in the facility?\nThe action is immediate and impressive. There’s great-looking effects-heavy aerial combat to enjoy, but the hand-to-hand stuff with Mando is seriously great. His escape from the beskar-clad stormtroopers is cool enough, but a set-piece in which he moves one-by-one between barrier shields — like the ones that separated Obi-Wan from Qui-Gon and Darth Maul in The Phantom Menace — taking down troopers and using their pilfered weapons to tackle the next batch is probably the best small-scale fight of the entire series.\nDeeper into Gideon’s base, Mando and Grogu make an alarming discovery — he has had himself cloned. Multiple times.\nAfter destroying the clones, Mando confronts Gideon, who implies that through them he was trying to develop an affinity with the Force — cloning Force-sensitive beings is canonically extremely difficult, and is presumably the point of Project Necromancer, leading to Palpatine’s return in The Rise of Skywalker — and he’s supremely ticked off that Mando ruined that plan. So, boss fight time it is.\nHow is Moff Gideon defeated?\nAfter telling Axe Woves to evacuate the capital ship, Bo-Katan and the other Mandalorians take shelter on the planet’s surface until the Armorer arrives with needed reinforcements, and the visual of the Mandalorians rocketing from the upper atmosphere, Bo-Katan leading the charge with the Darksaber, is another instantly-iconic set-piece.\nWhile Mando takes on Gideon in his impenetrable Dark Trooper armor, the Praetorian Guards get involved, leading to them chasing Grogu into another room. Bo-Katan arrives to duel Gideon with the Darksaber while Mando rescues Grogu, who helps him take down the Praetorians by throwing them around with the Force.\nWhen Gideon starts getting the upper hand, Mando and Grogu intervene for another showcase of Mandalorian togetherness and Grogu’s Force powers, which save them from the exploding facility. Gideon is killed, his clones are destroyed, and his facility is annihilated.\nWhy does Mando adopt Grogu?\nWith Mandalore retaken, the Armorer bathes Ragnar (Paz Vizsla’s son) in the Living Waters; it’s official graduation from foundling to apprentice. Mando wants the same for Grogu. Since he isn’t old enough to talk, though, he can’t speak the Creed, which makes him ineligible unless his parents agree for him to be a proper Mandalorian apprentice.\nSo, Mando adopts him. He’s now Din Grogu, Mandalorian apprentice, and Mando must leave Mandalore to take him on journeys and adventures. As the camera tracks down into the Living Waters, we see the Mythosaur open its eye.\nBo-Katan relights the Great Forge of a reunited Mandalore, the homeworld belonging to Mandalorians once more.\nThe third season of The Mandalorian ends with Mando visiting Carson Teva, offering to work for the New Republic as an independent contractor on a case-by-case basis. Since Grogu is his apprentice now, he’s going to be more selective in his assignments. All he wants in return is a “small advance” — the salvaged head of IG-11.\nOn Navarro, Greef Karga gives Mando a deed to a cabin where he can lay low between adventures, and Mando gives him a fully reconstituted and working IG-11, to function as the planet’s marshall.\nThe final shot is of Mando relaxing outside his new cabin while Grogu — sorry, Din Grogu — throws frogs around with the Force.\nYou can stream The Mandalorian Season 3 Episode 8, “Chapter 23: The Return” exclusively on Disney+.

All he wants in return is a “small advance” — the salvaged head of IG-11.\nOn Navarro, Greef Karga gives Mando a deed to a cabin where he can lay low between adventures, and Mando gives him a fully reconstituted and working IG-11, to function as the planet’s marshall.\nThe final shot is of Mando relaxing outside his new cabin while Grogu — sorry, Din Grogu — throws frogs around with the Force.\nYou can stream The Mandalorian Season 3 Episode 8, “Chapter 23: The Return” exclusively on Disney+.

            "text": "The Mandalorian Season 3 Episode 8 is out now which marks the final episode of this season. Created by Jon Favreau, the show is a part of the famous Star Wars franchise and takes place five years after the events of the 1983 film Return of the Jedi.\nThe Mandalorian stars Pedro Pascal as the title character aka Din Djarin along with Carl Weathers as Greef Karga, Werner Herzog as the Client, Omid Abtahi as Dr. Pershing, Nick Nolte as Kuiil, Gina Carano as Cara Dune, Giancarlo Esposito as Moff Gideon, Emily Swallow as the Armorer, Esposito, Timothy Olyphant as Cobb Vanth, Temuera Morrison as Boba Fett, Katee Sackhoff as Bo-Katan Kryze.\nWe also have Rosario Dawson as Ahsoka Tano, Mark Hamill as Luke Skywalker, Amy Sedaris as Peli Motto, Mercedes Varnado as Koska Reeves, Ming-Na Wen as Fennec Shand and several others. The third season will see the return of Esposito, Weathers, Sackhoff, Swallow, and Abtahi.\nThe eighth episode of season three is directed by Rick Famuyiwa and written by Jon Favreau. The episode is titled The Return and the runtime is 30-40 minutes.\n– Disney+ Hotstar’s The Mandalorian Season 3 Episode 8 Review Does Not Contain Spoilers –\nThe Mandalorian Season 3 Episode 8: The Return\nThe way The Mandalorian Season 3 Episode 7 turned out to be, really raised our hopes in regard to the finale and how the show can be more and grow over more seasons. In all honesty, apart from the first 2-3 episodes, it was only in the last one that we even felt that the show had really just begun, heading towards an intense finale and, we were not wrong, well not entirely at least.\nThe Mandalorian Season 3 Episode 8 starts in the same heartbeat as Episode 7 ended, without wasting much time we are directly put in the intense place where Din is in captivating by Moff Gideon and Bo-Katan and Grogu are trying their levels best to get our favourite Mandalorian out as well as fighting off evil. The episode does not delay in telling us that Din is safe after he manages to defend himself and escape his captors with some help from Grogu.\nDin Djarin must have had some time on his hands to make some stern decisions because all he wants to do after escaping is fight Moff Gideon and end his terror once and for all. Din strategizes, as it happens in every Star Wars piece ever and with the help of R5 hacks into the tech-bits to control the shield and get to Gideon. However, where he lands up in his search for retribution is tricky and, surely, not what any of us were expecting.\nAlso Read: Great Expectations Episode 5 Review: A Threatening Return From the Past\nMeanwhile, Bo-Katna and her troop are determined to take the planet back. After all, Mandalore belongs to the Mandalorians, right? Being the wielder of the Darksaber, things are never easy for Bo-Katan but, she likes challenges and she only continues to be a badass in The Mandalorian Season 3 Episode 8.\nAdditionally, it is Grogu who achieves the most in some sense in this episode- using the Force massively and finding a new place and title for himself by the end of it all.\nThe Mandalorian Season 3: Final Verdict\nThe Mandalorian Season 3 Episode 8 had its bits and buts. It was episode 7 that left us with more satisfaction than the finale one would say and, it would not be wrong. The finale felt pushed and rushed and, although it landed well, it was a rocky one that will not fill your heart like you would expect it.\nHaving said that, it is important to consider how The Mandalorian Season 3 has essentially been all over the place. There have been times when we felt like this season was unnecessary but, Favreau pulled it off ultimately. This is by far the weakest season of this Star Wars series and, a lot of us are unsure if we want more of it just for the heck of it or want to end this franchise on an emotional, bittersweet note.\nYou can watch The Mandalorian Season 3 Episode 8 now on Disney+ Hotstar.

            "text": "Mandalorian Season 3 Ending Explained, Review, and More\nby Hemalatha R | Updated Apr 20, 2023\nMandalorian Season 3 Ending Explained\nThe season 3 finale of The Mandalorian finally gives Din Djarin and Grogu the happy ending they deserve after facing numerous threats throughout the season. The episode takes place in the midst of the battle for Mandalore, as Bo-Katan Kryze leads her people against Moff Gideon and his Imperial troopers. The action-packed sequence sees Bo rally her fellow Mandalorians, while Din attempts to escape from Gideon's clutches.\nWith the help of Grogu, Din rescues his mentor and together, they set out to find and defeat Gideon. As they search for Gideon, Din and Grogu discover a sinister science lab where they learn about Gideon's cloning experiments. Using new technology developed by Dr. Pershing, Gideon has been trying to create a Force-sensitive army in his image.\nDin destroys the lab and the clones, but the scene serves as a reminder that the Empire's cloning experiments did not end on Kamino and will eventually lead to Palpatine's resurrection in The Rise of Skywalker. A brutal battle ensues between Gideon and his Praetorian guards against Bo, Din, and Grogu.\nBo is ultimately unable to defeat Gideon, but with the help of the father-son duo, they overpower him. A Mandalorian ship crashes into the base, and Gideon is assumed dead in the fiery wreckage, but this is Star Wars, and characters have been known to survive seemingly fatal situations.\nBo-Katan takes her place as the official ruler of Mandalore, and Din officially adopts Grogu as his son, and they start a new family business together. They take odd jobs for the New Republic and protect the Outer Rim, while living in a small cabin on the outskirts of Nevarro.\nThe season 3 finale of The Mandalorian does not feature any mid-credits or post-credits scene, and the show's co-creator Jon Favreau has previously stated that he and Dave Filoni have already written the scripts for season 4. Favreau has also said that he and Filoni have no plans to wrap up the show and will continue making it for as long as they can.\nThe Mandalorian Season 3 Finale Review\nThe third season of The Mandalorian has come to a close, leaving fans wanting more from Din Djarin and Grogu. The finale offered action-packed scenes but played it safe with a clean wrap-up in favor of the good guys. Din's quick escape from captivity undercut the previous cliffhanger, which was a letdown for those expecting a heart-wrenching episode with twists and turns.\nThe fight scene between Mando and Moff Gideon was a highlight, but Gideon's death was unsatisfying for a villain who had so much potential. Bo-Katan's stunning retaking of Mandalore was also a great use of The Volume and provided a serious tempo, but it left unanswered questions, such as how Bo-Katan moves on from not having the Darksaber.\nDespite the shortcomings, The Mandalorian has provided heartwarming moments, such as Din adopting Grogu as his own son, and a clear mission statement for future seasons. The Mandalorian intends to go back to bounty hunting basics, pottering around the galaxy, and cleaning up hives of scum and villainy on the Outer Rim. While the season lacked depth and shades of gray, it did offer a blueprint for how to take the world forward away from Mando, but it needs to focus on what Mando does best.\nMandalorian Season 3 Finale Recap\nThe third season of The Mandalorian has been described as lacking a single unifying theme or goal, unlike the previous two seasons, which were focused on missions to protect Grogu and reunite him with the Jedi. Instead, season three features three threads that converge in the finale: the Mandalorian quest to restore their planet, Mandalore; the obstacles to their plan, which include the New Republic bureaucracy and the Imperial remnant forces commanded by Moff Gideon; and Din Djarin and Grogu's off-the-books business helping the New Republic bring order to the Outer Rim.\nThe finale features a big battle between Gideon's stormtrooper army and the Mandalorians, which the heroes win, allowing them to begin resettling Mandalore. Djarin and Grogu successfully go after Gideon, with the help of R5-D4, and destroy a chamber full of his clones.\nThe climax sees Bo-Katan lend her Darksaber to the fight against Gideon, with Axe Woves crashing the privateers' light cruiser into the base. The episode ends with the Armorer rekindling the Great Forge and anointing foundlings in the Living Waters. Djarin formally adopts Grogu, who is given the name Din Grogu. The finale sets up the possibility of a fourth season that returns to the show's basics.\nMandalorian Season 3 Finale Post Credit Scene\nThe season 3 finale of The Mandalorian, titled \"The Return,\" breaks away from some of the show's usual conventions. While Moff Gideon is once again the final boss, there's no big cameo to save the day, and there are few easter eggs or callbacks. In a surprising twist, there's also no post-credits scene, with the episode ending on a peaceful note as Din and Grogu enjoy rest and relaxation in their new home on Nevarro.\nHowever, there is a moment in the final minutes of the episode that serves a similar purpose to a post-credits scene. It's revealed that IG-11 has returned, this time as Nevarro's new marshal. Thanks to the droid parts Din found, the Anzellans are able to patch up IG and bring him back online, but not as the killing machine of his original programming. Instead, he's closer to the nanny droid that Kuiil turned him into.\nThe return of IG-11 brings closure to a storyline that was set up in the season 3 premiere and teases what might be next for the character in season 4. Given that Din and Grogu now call Nevarro home and Din is freelancing for the New Republic's Carson Teva, it seems likely that IG-11 will appear in future missions.\nOverall, the finale of The Mandalorian season 3 offers a departure from the show's usual formula, but still manages to deliver an enjoyable and satisfying conclusion.\nMandalorian Season 3 Finale Runtime\nAccording to reports, the finale of The Mandalorian season 3 is only 39 minutes long including credits, making it shorter than the previous two seasons' finales and the third-shortest episode of season 3. The show takes place during the New Republic era, five years after the fall of the Empire in Return of the Jedi.\nOther series, such as The Book of Boba Fett and the upcoming Ahsoka and Skeleton Crew shows, are set within the same timeline and will culminate in a new Star Wars movie directed by Dave Filoni about the escalating conflict between the Imperials and the New Republic. Season 3 of The Mandalorian is now available for streaming on Disney+.\nThe Mandalorian Season 3 Cast\n|\n|\nCast\n|\n|\nCharacter\n|Pedro Pascal||Din Djarin / The Mandalorian|\n|Katee Sackhoff||Bo-Katan Kryze|\n|Emily Swallow||The Armorer|\n|Tait Fletcher||Paz Vizsla|\n|Carl Weathers||Elia Kane|\n|Paul Sun-Hyung Lee||Carson Teva|\n|Simon Kassianides||Axe Woves|\n|Mercedes Varnado||Koska Reeves|\n|Giancarlo Esposito||Moff Gideon|\nMandalorian Season 3 Trailer\nMandalorian Season 3 Ending Explained - FAQs\nThe third season of \"The Mandalorian\" follows three threads: the Mandalorian's plan to restore their home planet, the New Republic bureaucracy, and the Imperial remnant forces. However, the season did not seem to have a single unifying theme or goal that would give its story a shape.\nThe finale of Season 3 of \"The Mandalorian\" is tightly plotted and action-packed. It features some of the most impressive aerial fight scenes in the \"Star Wars\" franchise's history. The episode brings together all the threads of the season and culminates in a big battle on Mandalore between the Mandalorians and Gideon's stormtrooper army.\nThe main characters in the Season 3 finale of \"The Mandalorian\" are Din Djarin and Grogu. They team up to take on Gideon and his Praetorian Guards to save Mandalore and defeat the Imperial remnant forces.\nThe Mandalorians' ability to cultivate plants indigenous to Mandalore is significant because it shows that even Mandalorians without cutting-edge tech at their disposal can find a way. This little factoid counters something Gideon says later while he's destroying Bo-Katan's Darksaber, that \"Mandalorians are weak once they lose their trinkets.\"\nThe Season 3 finale of \"The Mandalorian\" sets up Season 4 that might bring the show back to basics. The episode's title, \"The Return,\" could have two meanings. It could refer to the return of the Mandalorians to their home planet or the return of the show to its original mission-based narrative structure.\nRelated Articles\n- The Last of Us Left Behind Walkthrough, Wiki, Guide, And Gameplay\n- The Mortuary Assistant Walkthrough, Guide, Gameplay, and More\n- Firefly Lane Season 2 Part 2 Cast, Where to Watch Firefly Lane Season 2 Part 2?\n- Where to find Fuses in Dead Island 2?

            "text": "The Mandalorian is back with a new season on Disney+ — and wow, has this been a long time coming. Just for context: Season 2 of the Star Wars show was filmed pre-COVID. That’s how long fans have been waiting to see a new adventure starring Pedro Pascal and his young companion — oh, the little green companion. Not talking about The Last of Us! The question is: does The Mandalorian Season 3 deliver what fans have been waiting for? Or is this season premiere too little too late?\nTHE MANDALORIAN SEASON 3: STREAM IT OR SKIP IT?\nOpening Shot: A gloved hand pours a vial of liquid into a basin, and the Armorer (Emily Swallow) places a plate of beskar over bright blue flames to prepare it for her hammers. Y’know, if the big-budget space opera premise starts wearing thin, Disney+ could easily turn the Armorer’s whole thing into a competition show like Netflix’s Blown Away. Imagine: two amateur alien blacksmiths standing before The Armorer, who then chooses the worst helmet of the week and says, “I’m sorry Phalodi Fabbro, this is … not the way.”\nThe Gist: It’s been just over two years since The Mandalorian Season 2 wrapped up and this show sure has to make up for lost time! Fortunately The Mandalorian Season 3 got some help from last year’s The Book of Boba Fett, which snuck in a few episodes that maybe should have been the Season 3 premiere. And therein lies the overall problem with The Mandalorian’s trajectory. If you just watch The Mandalorian, you’re going to be incredibly confused by this episode — and that’s why this “gist” may be the most important “gist” I’ve ever written.\nSo — as seen in The Book of Boba Fett last year, Din Djarin has been excommunicated from his conservative Mandalorian religion (or cult, depending on your POV) because he dared to remove his helmet. Djarin still has the Darksaber, the ancient Mandalorian lightsaber that grants whoever wields it dominion over the planet Mandalore. And after training with Luke Skywalker (for two years, according to writer Jon Favreau which… don’t try to make that make sense), Grogu has returned to Din Djarin. Now the two of them are zooming across the galaxy in their salvaged Naboo N-1 starfighter as the Mandalorian tries to find a way to atone for the sin of showing off his handsome, handsome mug.\nTo sum up the Season 3 premiere: Din Djarin… zooms across the galaxy in his salvaged Naboo N-1 starfighter on his way to atone for his sin of showing off his impossibly handsome mug.\nWhat Shows Will It Remind You Of? It’s the straightforward plotting, direct dialogue, and linear storytelling that The Mandalorian excelled at in Seasons 1 and 2. However, the Season 3 premiere feels a little more straightforward and direct coming after the dense, rich storytelling of Andor Season 1.\nSex and Skin: This is The Mandalorian. Showing skin — any skin — is not the way.\nParting Shot: After a bummer of a reunion with Bo-Katan Kryze (Katee Sackhoff), who’s holed up in an abandoned Mandalorian castle on the neighboring planet of Kalevala, Din Djarin heads off to his people’s home planet to bathe in the redemptive Living Waters and find out once and for all if Mandalore truly is poisoned and inhospitable, as is rumored.\nSleeper Star: I’m giving this to pirate commander Gorian Shard, who’s played (or at least voiced) by Nonso Anozie (Sweet Tooth). He’s a shambling, plant-faced, Swamp Thing-looking pirate, and he reminds me of the kind of silly characters that you see in the Star Wars comics and cartoons of the late ’70s and early ’80s. Still waiting for Favreau and Filoni to introduce Jaxxon!\nOur Take: The Mandalorian is a show that’s designed to feel a little out of touch. During its two-season reign as Disney+’s flagship series, The Mandalorian’s run-and-gun storytelling, tight editing, meme-ready moments, and massive heart felt like a reprieve from the bloated, 13-hour movie model of streaming TV popularized by Netflix. A lot has changed since The Mandalorian Season 2 — and a lot has changed just on Disney+. Need I point out that literally every single Marvel Studios live-action show has come out between Mandalorian Seasons 2 and 3?\nThat’s not to say that there’s not a place for The Mandalorian’s intentionally retro storytelling style on a post-Andor Disney+. In fact, The Mandalorian should hit even harder now that its Saturday morning storytelling can be juxtaposed against the thematic complexities of the only other ongoing live-action Star Wars TV show. I just think that, as far as examples of what The Mandalorian does best, The Mandalorian’s Season 3 premiere feels just… fine.\nThink back to the Season 2 premiere, way back in late October 2020. That episode felt like an event. In it, Din Djarin teamed up with a local marshal (Timothy Olyphant) and a village of Tusken Raiders to slay a literal dragon. It was a blast. The story, like pretty much every other episode, was a standalone story that still opened up the Star Wars canon a little bit more. We got to see a different side of Tusken society, thus making us look at all of their other appearances in a new, more nuanced light.\nBy comparison, the Season 3 premiere feels a little more closed off. There’s a repeat of the Tuskens vs. dragon storyline, except this time it’s members of Djarin’s Mandalorian sect vs. a giant alligator, and then the premiere hops around a little, kind of a “where are they now” for a couple of the show’s recurring characters. There’s a shootout with pirates, a horrific interlude with a hastily resurrected IG-11 (a plot that goes nowhere?), the return of the Babu Friks (a.k.a. a crew of Anzellans), and a bit of outerspace dogfight hide and seek. It’s all fine, but it’s all stuff that we’ve seen in Star Wars before, and stuff we’ve even seen on The Mandalorian before. It feels incredibly insular, and the fact that you have to have seen episodes of a completely different show in order to know what the hell is going on here only makes it feel even more so.\nIt’s a bit of a letdown because, again, it’s been two years since a show titled The Mandalorian dropped a new episode on Disney+. The Mandalorian episodes of Boba Fett were a blast and would’ve made for a more substantial Season 3 premiere. I still love these characters (Peli Motto Hive rise up). I’m even excited for where this season is going! There’s so much potential for bold adventure and surprises once Djarin sets foot on Mandalore — but that’s next week’s episode… I hope.\nOur Call: In the binary system that is STREAM IT or SKIP IT, I have to give this episode a SKIP IT for now. This is a premiere that would’ve greatly benefitted from being one of two episodes released today, or part of a longer episode that actually took us somewhere — anywhere — new.",

            "text": "The following blog contains spoilers for season 3, episode 8 of The Mandalorian.\nAnd now, we can finally relax.\nAfter last week’s tense cliffhanger the stage was set for one hell of a final battle, which appeared to have consequences reaching far beyond the end of season three.\nWe did get some epic action this week – but my predictions that this finale would directly set up Ahsoka and the upcoming film set to conclude the “MandoVerse” fell short. Rather than welcome in Thrawn as the new big bad to replace Moff Gideon, the seeds were instead set for a fourth season far less sprawling in scale.\nThat’s right, the season three finale seems to offer the big promise that, after a divisive season which jumped around several plotlines, the next Mandalorian outing will take us back to basics: Din Djarin, Grogu (sorry, *Din* Grogu) and their adventures across the galaxy. Y’know, everything that fans loved about the first two seasons.\nHow the finale sets up season four\nFans have complained that the father-son relationship between Din and Grogu has taken too much of a backseat to the rest of the action this season. Rick Famuyiwa, director of several episodes (including this week’s finale), has previously spoken about how the title of the show no longer refers just to Din Djarin, but also to Bo Katan – but the finale seems to suggest they won’t have equal narrative weight next time around.\nWith Moff Gideon’s threat dealt with, Mandalore is now back in the hands of its people, which brings Bo Katan’s quest to find and unite all Mandalorian tribes to fight for their home planet to something of an end. It’s unclear just how central she’ll be to the next season, considering that we end the episode by splitting up Din and Grogu from every main character we’ve spent more time with in this season.\nDin (or is his first name Djarin?) wants Grogu to be his apprentice, adopting him as his son as he’s too young to speak and take the Mandalorian oath. The Armorer grants his wish, and the two head off for space adventures, most of which will likely revolve around their new role as independent contractors for the New Republic, sniffing out any Imperial threats in the Outer Rim.\nIt all sounds like a return to the formula of the first two seasons, with more episodic adventures between the father-son duo and a whole host of wacky villains. The big overarching threat is gone – unless Thrawn or another heir to the Empire is looking towards the territory to seize power.\nWhere next for Bo Katan?\nAs for Bo Katan, she’s staying on Mandalore to help bring the culture of the Mandalorians back to life. The big question here is whether or not this will play a key role going forward, now that Din and Grogu are no longer part of the same storyline.\nWith no mid or post credits teases about future projects – like how season two ended with a Book Of Boba Fett stinger – all we can do is speculate about where this character can fit in the future. Both of her central storylines come to a close here, as her possession of the Darksaber ends via Moff Gideon destroying it, a somewhat anticlimactic way of resolving that tension between the two.\nWith a new Mandalore in the process of being built, I’m intrigued to see just how central this could be to season four, especially considering how the two Dins have been granted a new home elsewhere. Would we still jump across the galaxy to give this equal screentime, the storytelling aspect that has caused some frustration this season, or would this be explored in a different show altogether?\nAlas, we didn’t get any answers this week, but at least we don’t need to worry about the future of the galaxy for a while. Let’s let Din and Grogu have a moment of peace as a newfound family before all hell breaks loose again.",

            "text": "The Mandalorian season 3's ending will probably be argued about, since many may have wanted more. But after a notably uneven season, it feels as if the finale served up exactly what the series needed: a reboot.\nThe only real problem is that it felt more like a series finale than a season finale. We'll get to all the details below, so you better watch The Mandalorian season 3 before you continue.\nAnd, yes, this is one episode you'll be glad you watched. There are no celebrity cameos, and there's a lot of good Grogu moments, too. Let's dive into everything that happened in The Mandalorian season 3 finale after the perfunctory spoiler warning!\nThe Mandalorian season 3 finale felt like closure\nI'll get to the final shot of the episode below, but let's provide context. The episode began just as Chapter 23 ended: Din Djarin (Pedro Pascal) was captured by Moff Gideon (Giancarlo Esposito) and the Dark Troopers, while Bo-Katan Kryze (Katee Sackhoff) is on the run with her fellow Mandalorians.\nFortunately, Din escapes, as he's helped by Grogu in his IG-12 mech suit. Bo-Katan, Koska Reeves (Mercedes Varnado) and the other Mandalorians find shelter in secret farms under the surface of Mandalore. Then, Mando and Grogu find a bay of Moff Gideon clones, which they (thankfully) destroy.\nBo-Katan, armed with the Darksaber, leads her soldiers into battle, and Gideon reveals to Djarin his plan was to meld The Force with his Dark Troopers. In one of the rare moments of actual peril, Grogu squares off with the Praetorian Guards — those red-caped troopers working with Gideon. They knock his IG-12 armor down, but he giggles and Forces his way up and into the air.\nThen, Bo-Katan comes to Djarin's aide so Mando can rescue Grogu right as the lil dude is trapped under some fallen debris. The two survive, as Grogu uses the force to fight, and Mando tells him, \"You did good, kid.\"\nThis is when Mandalorian Axe Woves (Simon Kassianides), piloting one of their ships in the sky, warns our heroes that he's going to crash the dang thing into Moff Gideon's Mandalore base. Here, we have our first kind-of important moment of the episode: Gideon breaks the Darksaber with his fist while fighting Bo-Katan.\nAnd while Bo-Katan is in jeopardy for a brief moment, Din comes to her rescue, prompting her to say \"Mandalorians are stronger together.\" Grogu and Mando work together to fight Gideon, with the little one using The Force to knock his weapon away into a chasm. Then, Woves' ship crashes through the base, spreading fire everywhere. While the flames seem to consume Gideon (no dead body is found), Grogu uses a Force-based forcefield to protect himself, Bo-Katan and Mando.\nThe Mandalorian season 3's ending is a reboot for a potential season 4\nTime has passed when we see a new Mandalorian induction ceremony where The Armorer is talking Ragnar (Wesley Kimmel) through the ceremony. Mando asks if Grogu can go next, but the Armorer says his inability to talk means he can't be an apprentice.\nDin finds a compromise, offering to adopt Grogu, so he's able to provide verbal consent. Now, Mando and Grogu are officially adoptive father and son. The Armorer says \"This is the way.\" And Mando's told that they now need to leave and \"take [Grogu] on his journeys.\" Grogu looks into the waters, and we see another glimpse of the mythosaur opening its eye.\nAt the Great Forge, The Armorer hands Kryze the torch to relight the flames, and the rows of Mandalorians — including members of both factions — provide clanging applause. Woves, Reeves and Ragnar are among those saluting. Mandalore is basically restored, or on its way there.\nAnd our story gets its last pieces set up back at Carson Teva's base of New Republic pilots. There, Grogu notices an IG droid head as Mando asks if he can freelance for the New Republic, but on a secret case-by-case basis. In return, they get the IG head, which is used to restore IG-11, who becomes the new marshal of Nevarro.\nAnd The Mandalorian season 3 ends anti-climactically, as all seems peaceful with Grogu using the force on a frog as Mando chills nearby.\nOutlook: Is The Mandalorian's story over?\nAs we've learned at Star Wars Celebration 2023, The Mandalorian, Ahsoka, The Book of Boba Fett and other shows will end in a big movie. The ending of this season of The Mandalorian almost suggests that our heroes' main story is finished, saving them for a role to play in this massive cross-over film.\nThat said, The Mandalorian season 3 episode 7 teased what's next in the overall story. The remnants of the Empire still have Project Necromancer up their sleeves, and Grand Admiral Thrawn is coming in Ahsoka. But, for now, it seems like Mando and Grogu will just be adventurers.\nTheir story doesn't need to be \"over,\" and they will have more adventures as Mando shows Grogu the galaxy, as the Armorer told him to. We just pray that their lives aren't just dedicated to stopping space pirates.",

            "text": "Ever since Disney+ brought Marvel and Star Wars to television, there's been an increased interest in runtimes. Those have always been a hot topic among fans when it comes to movies, but it's now the case for these small screen offerings as well.\nUltimately, it boils down to us all simply wanting more, but if you're hoping for a giant-sized The Mandalorian season 3 finale, there's a strong chance you'll be disappointed. While it's more than the mere 25 minutes some \"scoopers\" claimed it would be earlier this month, the episode is going to clock in at just 38 minutes and 56 seconds.\nIn fairness, that's roughly the same length as the season 3 premiere, \"The Apostate,\" but it's quite a bit shorter than The Mandalorian's previous finales. Season 1's \"Redemption\" was 50 minutes, while season 2's \"The Rescue\" was 48 minutes. That makes this the show's shortest finale to date, a surprise when there's so much story to cram in before we once again bid farewell to Din Djarin and Grogu.\nIt's possible we'll be left with a cliffhanger that sets the stage for season 4, of course, and this is a more than adequate amount of time for Moff Gideon to be defeated, Bo-Katan Kryze to establish herself as Mandalore's ruler, and possibly even reveal whether there's a traitor in their midst.\nAs per usual, there's no word on what to expect from this episode, though we do know Rick Famuyiwa is at the helm after also directing \"The Spies\" last Wednesday.\nDisney and Lucasfilm go to great lengths to stop spoilers from leaking online and that means critics won't get to see the finale in advance. Needless to say, you'll want to check back here tomorrow for our breakdowns of everything that happens.\nAre you excited for The Mandalorian's season 3 finale?",

            "text": "Star Wars: The Mandalorian Season One finale review!\nSo many answers in so little time!\nThe first season of Star Wars: The Mandalorian has concluded. Overall, I’m pretty happy with the series existing. Season One started really strong and then aimlessly meandered a bit, feeling a little like a 90’s television show with the episode of the week. Even during the aimless episodes, I enjoyed it for what it was and each episode did bring a little bit of flavor to the table. I would have preferred more depth to the final arc of the series but the final two episodes were really strong for what they were.\nTaika Waititi’s direction in the final episode is really pretty stellar. It was cinematic and strong. That really isn’t a surprise considering his film career so far. What was surprising was that he made IG-11, a generic reiteration of IG-88, into a character worlds stronger than IG-88 ever was. He began as a generic kill bot and by the end of the season he was a nurse who sacrificed himself so Baby Yoda aka The Child could live. Without Waititi’s direction and performance the season wouldn’t have really worked. His death wasn’t exactly Terminator 2 strong and I didn’t cry like when E.T. went home, but it was satisfying and it did give the final episode some weight and proved fun characters can die.\nMoff Gideon is really fascinating. But he feels a bit under-cooked in the first season. The regional governor has a lot of backstory given to us. Hell, even the Mandalorian’s name Dyn Jarren is revealed in relation to him having been an ISB officer with access to intelligence that allows him to know everything about the cast of the series. Giancarlo Esposito is a fantastic actor with a lot of creepy charisma when needed. I love everything about him, but I also could have used a lot more this season about the character beyond just circumstantial plot elements that build him up. That Darksaber reveal was fantastic. Those Death Troopers were cool to see with him. Now, I want to see him be interesting rather than having interesting attributes and backstory connections. I think they’ll pull it off but season one left a lot to be desired on that front and filled that crucial time which could have been used to deepen the character with episodes that didn’t contribute much to the overall arc of the season, and when you’re only doing eight episodes and only six really matter, it makes it less than what the season and characters like Gideon could have been by the end of chapter 8.\nIt was really weird in the final chapter, Kara Dune says she doesn’t do the whole kid thing, and yet she does the kid thing. They didn’t do that to her the whole season so it was strange that it happened in the end, especially when Greef Carga really didn’t do much but pound drinks for a lot of the episode. Almost everyone takes care of Baby Yoda in the episode, so I’m in no way calling it sexist as much as a misstep to even acknowledge the terrain they were walking on in the final chapter.\nI am disappointed that the rumor that Ewan McGregor was going to be in the episode to pull Dyn Jarren out of the bunker didn’t pan out, but it was pretty rad to see that he was saved by Death Watch Mandalorians. These Mandalorians aren’t exactly like the people that we saw in The Clone Wars on Mandalore. These are more of a creed based type of warrior or mercenaries, and Dyn was raised in the Fighting Corps. We see Mandos in a state of heroic triumph and then we have it confirmed that things do not go well for Mandos after the events of Star Wars Rebels. That Darksaber was in the possession of Bo Katan (The Clone Wars, Rebels) but she has either died or was disgraced by Moff Gideon.\nThose scout troopers that killed Kuiil sure are a couple of dicks. I was hoping Baby Yoda was going to heal Kuiil and he would get medieval on them, as the episode progressed, it was obvious that it wasn’t going to happen that way. Then they started hitting Baby Yoda and I was happy to see those dicks die by IG-11’s robot pincers.\nDyn Jarren isn’t really my favorite Star Wars name to be honest. It sounds rather generic. The night after making a video, my lady friend and I went to have a breakfast burrito at Pepe’s. Interestingly, the name of the restaurant before it was renamed to Pepe’s sounded almost exactly like Dyn Jarren. So it is clearly playing on some Western trope like Jango Fett to D’Jango. I took a picture of it to note for this review, but I can’t find it., So I guess that if it’s an excuse to get a breakfast burrito at Pepe’s Finest Mexican Food, then fine Mexican food it is.\nIt was pretty crazy watching this episode, as it was chalk full of scoops obtained from the series. I remember visiting the location of the set a year ago this Christmas and seeing the crashed TIE Fighter that Gideon flies, just sitting out there. We saw the lava boat and the tunnel constructed and used over many days. I saw the droid that drove the boat and drew a detailed image. On the podcast we revealed that IG-11 would be riding speeder bikes and actually having action sequences. The best day of, according to my kids, was the day we saw Death Troopers filming with tons of Stormtroopers. It was fun, and a bit crazy, to see all of these things coming together in this episode. One of the coolest moments was seeing Taika Waititi direct the scene where Dyn walks out of the door to fight the Stormtroopers and the Death Trooper.\nWhen I first heard that the series was going to be about a Mandalorian after the Empire fell,it was going to be about a kid, and that kid was going to be what restored Mandalore. That kid ended up being Baby Yoda, but it wasn’t until this episode that I thought that it might not have changed. This kid is not a part of the two man clan. It is wacky, but it is also really rad, because it is so insane that it makes me giddy.\nI enjoyed the episode. I enjoyed the season. The Darksaber is back. Baby Yoda lives. We still don’t know why they want Baby Yoda. Is it to heal Palpatine on Exegol? There’s a lot going on with the post-Return of the Jedi universe, and I can’t wait to see it develop with this series. I hope that season two uses the episodes at its disposal more effectively than the first season,, but I loved pretty much every moment of it. So far, Star Wars on Disney+ has depth, and it doesn’t feel like it only serves a superficial existence, and I love that. I hope that the show continues to grow, gets even better, and further expands upon the foundation that shows like Star Wars: The Clone Wars already started, by continuing to bring cinematic storytelling to the small screen.\nRandom Stuff I saw on set:\nWhen Fav and Filoni say hello. pic.twitter.com/2jMKRHFekp\n— Jason Ward (@MakingStarWars) November 13, 2018",

Now wearing the next generation Dark Trooper suit forged from beskar alloy, Moff Gideon (Giancarlo Esposito) has returned to complete the Purge of Mandalore and create an army using the best attributes of the cloners, the Jedi, and the Mandalorians.\n\"The Spies\" ended with Din captured by Gideon, who ordered Bo-Katan to surrender the Darksaber to its \"rightful owner\" and tell her people that Mandalore belongs to him. But before Gideon's Dark Troopers could wipe out what was left of the Mandalorians, Bo-Katan led her trapped people's retreat as the Tribe's Paz Vizsla (Tait Fletcher) stayed behind to hold off the army — only to fall in battle against a trio of red-suited Praetorian Guards.\n\"This next episode is gonna make you wish you hadn't asked for [another episode],\" actor Brendan Wayne, the in-suit double for Din, wrote in a cryptic Instagram story. \"It might just hurt too much.\"\nAhead of the season 3 finale, The Mandalorian executive producer Dave Filoni has said that fans will \"have a lot to think about\" after the Rick Famuyiwa-directed \"Chapter 24\" concludes on April 19th.\n\"They'll have a lot to take in, and I think with any good ending there's the moment you're in it when you're cheering and you feel satisfied, but then there's a little bit after that where you think back at all the things that happened,\" Filoni, who wrote \"The Spies,\" told Collider. \"Maybe you start to put them together in a different way and you realize it's an ending, but there are other things happening out there in the galaxy that now you know more about.\"\nNew episodes of Star Wars: The Mandalorian are streaming Wednesdays on Disney+.1comments",

            "text": "That’s all, folks. The Mandalorian season 3 has signed off with a surprisingly definitive ending that played it safe in most respects – but still left us wanting more from Din Djarin and (Din) Grogu in a galaxy far, far away.\nThose expecting a complex, heart-wrenching episode filled with twists and turns will see the writing on the wall almost immediately: Din’s quick escape from captivity completely undercuts the cliffhanger of the previous Chapter. It certainly can’t be accused of wasting time – much of the season has been spinning its wheels until now, after all – but sets the tone for everything being wrapped up a little too cleanly in favor of the good guys.\nAt least the action is well worth sticking around for – even if you can telegraph everything else well in advance. Mando’s messy, desperate fight through the shield barriers and towards Moff Gideon’s cloning bunker is an inspired set-piece that carries shades of Obi-Wan waiting behind while Qui-Gon Jin fought Darth Maul in The Phantom Menace. It also gives a chance for the choreography, probably one of the more overlooked aspects this season, to get its flowers – which is no bad thing.\nThat’s also the case for Bo-Katan’s stunning retaking of Mandalore, a fizzing aerial set-piece that again makes great use of The Volume and provides some serious tempo as Mando inches towards a showdown with Giancarlo Esposito’s glowering Moff Gideon.\nTheir tussle doesn’t disappoint, with Gideon getting the upper hand on more than one occasion and – finally – a sense of real peril as Grogu is cornered by the Praetorian Guards who dispatched Paz in the previous episode.\nInevitably, Bo-Katan swoops in to save the day, finally getting some revenge for giving up Mandalore to the Empire. That does come at a cost, however, as Gideon shows some much-needed physicality (his season 2 finale showing was weak, let’s be honest) to crush the Darksaber and get the upper hand on Bo-Katan. She, Mando, and Grogu are only saved when Axe Woves pulls off the impossible and crashes a Star Destroyer into the Imperial base.\nThe end result of the kamikaze act is a mixed one. Moff Gideon seemingly dies in a blaze of fury, an unsatisfying end to a villain that had so much more to give. Grogu’s hero moment, using the Force to shield the flames, is a much more earned character beat – and a deserving pay-off for the little guy’s training with Luke.\nChapter 24 is then wrapped up with the heartwarming reveal of Din Djarin adopting Grogu as his own son, all while The Great Forge burns again on a reclaimed Mandalore. The Mandalorian then sets out its mission statement for potential future seasons: Mando heads to Carson Teva of the New Republic and makes very clear his intentions are to go back to bounty hunting basics. If we get another season – and Jon Favreau has said we will – then expect a more chilled, low-key series of adventures involving Din Djarin and Grogu pottering around the galaxy and cleaning up hives of scum and villainy on the Outer Rim. Sign us up.\n‘The Return’, though, is guilty of being too risk-averse, introducing intriguing ideas and instantly tossing them to one side. Moff Gideon’s clones? Gone in an instant. How does Bo-Katan move on from not having the Darksaber? We never really find out. And what of the remnants of the Empire and the Shadow Council? A story for another day, perhaps. When even Axe Woves is unscathed from what should have been a suicide mission, that’s a bit of a red flag.\nBut if The Mandalorian ended now, it would be hard to find fault with how the curtain came down. Mando getting his own peaceful homestead on Nevarro is a fairly neat way to wrap up the series. Most other loose ends, too, have been tied away. In that respect, the season 3 finale is a job well done – even if it lacked the magnetic spark carried by Luke Skywalker’s savior act a few years back.\nAs for the season as a whole? The Mandalorian season 3 is perhaps the biggest victim of a post-Andor world. Simply, it was never the super in-depth show people now want it to be. There are no shades of gray here; good often triumphs over evil in Star Wars – and remains the case here.\nBut there are lessons to be learned. The world-widening Chapter with Doctor Pershing is a good blueprint of how to take this world forward away from Mando, while detours to Plazir-15 and a raptor’s nest, conversely, failed to dazzle with how often it took the spotlight from Din Djarin. If – and when – The Mandalorian returns, it needs to navigate its own space in the wider franchise with more purpose by focusing on what Mando, not anyone else, does best. Until then, we’ll be counting down the days until we can see Grogu and his new daddy once more.\nGet up to speed on the galaxy far, far away with our guide to everything announced at Star Wars Celebration 2023 and all the upcoming Star Wars movies and Disney Plus TV shows. Then get ready for more Star Wars adventures with what to watch before Ahsoka.",

            "text": "This post contains spoilers for The Mandalorian season finale, which premiered December 27 on Disney+.\nAs Star Wars stories go, The Mandalorian used its eight-episode run to unspool a very different story from the much bigger and higher-profile The Rise of Skywalker, which debuted in theaters December 17. The movie, which concluded the story of Rey (Daisy Ridley) and Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), leans into themes of inheritance, succession, and dynasty—all pivoting around a mid-film reveal about Rey’s parentage and the ongoing, nine-film arc about the struggle between the light and dark sides of the Force.\nIt’s illuminating that The Mandalorian—which is suffused with the aesthetics and mood of Star Wars, particularly the slower and emptier original trilogy—is both indubitably a Star Wars property and yet, from the start, has had nothing to do with these lofty concerns. The discovery of the Being—that is to say, baby Yoda, the cutest creature this side of the galaxy—is the closest the show has gotten to the Force or any conception of lineage, and yet The Mandalorian has firmly placed the creature in the care of the titular Mandalorian (Pedro Pascal), naming him the baby’s foster father. No one has even articulated the words “the Force,” and in the finale, the mysterious Armorer (Emily Swallow) refers to the Jedi as an enemy race of powerful “sorcerers.” The Mandalorian is ignorant to the Skywalker stories; it’s about something else.\nThat “something else’ has become increasingly compelling throughout the Mandalorian’s first season, which combines a faceless sworn sword with an acutely adorable child and then ping-pongs them through a few galactic sectors. It can be seen in how the show has caught on in pop culture, despite premiering on a brand-new platform as a day-one offering. Pascal’s character has taken on the nickname “Mando,” both in and out of the show; the Being has never been called “baby Yoda” in the show, but that is what we all know to call him. There’s not much more to the spare plot—the basic premise is understood in a snap—which leaves a lot of room for Ludwig Göransson’s scintillating score, the numerous scenes of blistering fight choreography, and the wide open spaces of the galactic frontier.\nIn short, The Mandalorian offers reams of blank canvas for us project our Star Wars visions onto—not least of which is Mando’s expressionless helmet, as Pascal murmurs with finality, “This is the way.” Shrouded in mystery—and with the full power of the Star Wars universe behind it—The Mandalorian emphasizes the chaos and desperation of the galaxy, as it’s experienced on the ground, by residents without, you know, lightsabers. A New Hope’s space western atmosphere has never been rekindled as well as it has been in The Mandalorian, which takes the audience through a galaxy that is really rife with danger—and strangers. Free of the requirements of nostalgia, The Mandalorian has had the flexbility to create fascinating new characters. Thanks to the enthusiastic, spirited performances of brilliantly cast supporting players Werner Herzog, Gina Carano, Carl Weathers, Amy Sedaris, Nick Nolte, and Giancarlo Esposito, The Mandalorian’s universe feels vividly inhabited by different, variously motivated characters—each with their relationship to the Empire, the Being, and maybe most importantly, to money.\nAs a result, The Mandalorian has created a Star Wars story where, for the first time in a long time, the story feels unpredictable. The adventure stands alone, without prequels or sequels; it has nothing but its own momentum to rely on. The stakes of the adventure are smaller than the glitzy theatrical releases—but much easier to grasp than huge spacecraft battles, or the slippery definitions of the Force. At the same time, it hasn’t lost its sense of fun. Somehow, in the midst of depicting multiple massacres, the finale has room for multiple laughs—be it the banter of idiot stormtroopers Jason Sudeikis and Adam Pally, neither of whom is much of a marksman, or the droll comic timing of IG-11 (Taika Waititi), the former hunter turned “nurse-droid.” In episode seven, the last appearance of Herzog’s client character, he deadpans one of the best single-serving lines in Star Wars history in a snarling drawl: “Can I offer you a libation to celebrate the closing of our shared narrative?\" (Then he dies.)\nThe finale closes out the season with a bang, showing Mando—ok fine, we just learned his real name is Din Djarin, but Mando’s easier to remember—just how much violence the Empire is willing to use to capture the little one. It is a perverse indication of The Mandalorian’s storytelling chops that at the moment where the bigger Star Wars themes need to be tweaked, the show finds a way to call the Mandalorian to duty—and to emphasize the cruelty of killing the innocent—in a backstory that belongs wholly to The Mandalorian, not to an earlier movie shot in a different decade. It’s further testament to Pascal’s skill as a performer that despite showing us his face only once throughout the season, his character’s silent pledge to protect the Being has become enough to define his character, signifying both his own gratitude to his adopted family, and how a ruthlessly powerful Mandalorian might differentiate himself from a mercenary—or the Empire.",

            "text": "Last week’s ending saw the Armorer tasking Bo-Katan Kryze to unite all the different clans of Mandalore just as the covert was given a new home on Nevarro. This week, though, the stakes are a little higher as something surprising happens to Din Djarin, Grogu, and Bo-Katan. Learn more from The Mandalorian season 3 episode 6 ending explained and find out what happened in this week’s installment of everyone’s favorite Star Wars series.\nThe Mandalorian season 3 episode 6 ending explained\nIn this week’s The Mandalorian season 3 episode 6 recap, we see an Imperial ship flag down a Quarren ship as its captain attempts to barter with its crew. Shortly after, it’s revealed that a group of Mandalorians have taken control of the Imperial ship and have been hired by the Mon Calamari to take the Quarrens down and bring back a prince home. Koska Reeves takes the young Mon Calamari back to their ship to complete the mission they were hired for.\nWith the Armorer’s task in her heart, Bo-Katan Kryze takes Din Djarin and Grogu to meet Axe Wolves and convince his forces to join their covert. Upon landing, they are met by two Imperial droids, making them question their presence on Plazir-15. The three are then taken before the system’s ruler, Captain Bombardier, a former Imperial planning officer played by Jack Black, and his wife, the planet’s Duchess as portrayed by Lizzo. The two take Bo-Katan, Din, and Grogu on a walk and confide in them about a droid problem they”re having. They further expound that these are battle droids and they have been causing chaos inside the city. In exchange for their help, they promise to recognize Mandalore as a sovereign system.\nInside a central monitoring location, Commisioner Helgait, played by Christopher Lloyd, shows Din and Bo-Katan how the battle droids have been causing trouble. He adds that these droids can’t be shut down completely because their society will collapse. The officer asks them to take down the rogue droids so they can repair the whole system right away.\nDin and Bo-Katan proceed to a lower level to speak with a group of Ugnaughts about the malfunctioning droids. One of them assures the two that the droids are not malfunctioning. Din then gets the locations of the malfunctioning droids and he takes Bo-Katan to the first of them – a dock where a host of these are working. After knocking one of the droids over, it knocks Din down and a chase ensues as the two Mandalorians follow it. Bo-Katan manages to shoot the super battle droid down after it caused severe property damage and alarming Plazir-15’s citizens.\nAfter finding a lead, Bo-Katan and Din enter a bar filled with droids. Bo-Katan tries to interrogate the barkeeper peacefully while Din starts to become aggressive. The two find out that the planet’s droids are afraid that they will be replaced by humans. Bo-Katan and Din speak to the barkeeper in its private quarters and learn all about Nepenthe – a special kind of oil that reprogram droids to do a different function than the one they were originally imbued with. The two head on to check the body of the super battle droid they took down and find the presence of Nepenthe inside it. All of a sudden, a floating droid assistant attacks them, causing Din to take it down using the Darksaber.\nUpon close inspection, they learn Nepenthe is filled with nanobots and possesses a chain code. The code further revealed that the person responsible for causing these droids to malfunction is no other than Commissioner Helgait himself. With this information now known, Din and bo-Katan question Helgait about his involvement in the matter. Before he can be taken in, the old commissioner threatens to activate all the droids to attack the citizens. It’s later revealed that he’s a Separatist, causing Bo-Katan to take him out quickly.\nBack in the ruling chamber, Din and Bo-Katan present Helgait as the reason for the droids’ malfunction to Bombardier and the Duchess. He is exiled by the Duchess for his actions and rewards Din and Bo-Katan with a key to the system for their effort in solving the case. Grogu is also granted knighthood by the Duchess.\nWith the job done, Bo-Katan, Din, and Grogu approach the Mandalorian forces on Plazir-15 to speak to them. Upon arrival, Bo-Katan demands his former comrades to stand down. She challenges Axe for the leadership, something which the latter accepts. The two duke it out with Bo-Katan ultimately winning. After doing so, she talks to the Mandalorians present about being stronger together. After Axe questions the legitimacy of Bo-Katan’s claim, Din explains to everyone that the Darksaber rightfully belongs to her after saving him beneath Mandalore’s surface using the said sword.\nNow that the Darksaber is in her possession, Mandalorians around them acknowledges Bo-Katan’s leadership as she activates the Darksaber again.\nWhat just happened? The Mandalorian season 3 episode 6 recap\nThe first half of The Mandalorian season 3 episode 6 recap mostly deals with Bo-Katan and Din assisting Plazir-15’s government in quelling their droid problem. With a number of cameo appearances by Jack Black, Lizzo, Christopher Lloyd, Ugnaughts, and the battle droids from the Clone Wars, this portion felt light and didn’t add that much to the overall story.\nThings get more interesting after being given access to the Mandalorians occupying the space outside the city. After regaining the leadership of her Mandalorian forces, there were still some who questioned Din’s status as one of them. Bo-Katan defends him, just as Din presents proof that the real owner of the Darksaber isn’t him anymore. The episode ends with Bo-Katan becoming the Darksaber’s new owner and the rightful ruler of Mandalore. Stay tuned next week to find out what happens after this shocking development and how it will impact the fate of Mandalorians all over the galaxy.",

            "text": "The Mandalorian season 2 has now concluded and what a journey it was. While not perfect, the show expanded in scope and connected to disparate parts of the canon, all while maintaining a strong and emotional core with the relationship between the eponymous hero and his little green friend. I just finished watching the finale a few hours ago and, in truth, I’m still shocked. For its first half, the episode felt fairly perfunctory, if not disappointingly so, before changing the series forever in its engrossing final minutes.\nIt’s difficult not to jump straight to the end but let’s restrain ourselves and travel all the way back to the finale’s beginning. Over the past few weeks, The Mandalorian has shined new light on the actions of our heroes and made us question just who we’re rooting for. The penultimate episode manipulated us into cheering for the Imperial Remnant, and in the finale’s opening scene a discussion straight from the fandom is canonised. The Rebellion blew up millions of beings on the two Death Stars and the galaxy celebrated in response. It’s easy to see why some hate the new regime and stick with the fading Empire. These small moments are why I love the show, straight after a dogfight between a Lambda-class shuttle and the Slave 1. Speaking of which, how exactly do those ships dock? What does that even look like?\nWith Dr Pershing captured – and his status as a cloner confirmed – Mando and the crew head off to an unknown planet to recruit Bo-Katan to the cause. I presumed Bo-Katan’s appearance would be limited to one episode so I’m overjoyed at her return, and no doubt her continuing involvement in the series next season. We even see a Mandalorian Gauntlet starfighter in live-action for the first time. It was great to see Boba be taunted with his status as a clone, and his angry response. I wish we got more of Boba this season and that he and Din could have actually had a discussion about his heritage. But it looks like we’re getting much more of Boba in the future so there’s always time. With the team together, the plan agreed upon, and Pershing… left behind on the planet I guess, the assault on Gideon’s cruiser begins.\nI’ll happily watch, and listen to, the Slave 1 fly around for hours on end so I loved the brief chase and deception that allowed the crew access to the Arquitens-class Command Cruiser. Onboard however is when the episode felt a little flat. After several episodes this season featuring characters running down endless corridors that look exactly the same and blasting Stormtroopers that can’t hit a thing, I was tired of it by this episode. There were some fun, John Wick-inspired moments but most of the action with the Stormtroopers was dull. It was great to realise halfway through the sequence that, with Din elsewhere, everyone in the group was a badass woman. I just wish I enjoyed the overall sequence as much as I do the characters within it.\nWhile the white-armoured Stormtroopers rag-doll at the slightest touch, the robotic Dark Troopers prove to be a much more powerful adversary. They also seem to play dubstep when activated. They must have a record deal with the Techno Union. I did enjoy Din’s fight with the Dark Trooper, and when it began punching his helmet I suffered flashbacks to Pedro Pascal’s brutal death in Game of Thrones. The Darksaber duel with Gideon was also good but maybe a little anticlimactic. I wasn’t expecting him to be captured though, and I haven’t a clue what’s next for him. Will he be rescued by the Imperial Remnant or spill the beans to his New Republic captors? There’s still so much to his plans and possible First Order connections that we don’t know.\nUp until this point, the finale hadn’t been bad but it did feel somewhat unremarkable. That all changed with the arrival of a solitary X-Wing. I knew who it was instantly but Peyton Reed’s direction did a fantastic job of keeping you waiting until you start second guessing yourself. First, he’s just a cloaked figure. Then a cloaked figure on a black-and-white security screen wielding a lightsaber, which you can’t tell the colour of, slicing through Dark Troopers like blue milk butter. And then: GREEN! That’s right, it’s Luke Skywalker. Like father, like son, he gets his own hallway action scene as he makes his way to our heroes on the bridge.\nI like how Luke was handled as a character, which is to say that they do very little with his character other than him perfectly fitting the mandate of a Master Jedi. I’ve seen cries of fan service in the hours since the episode has aired and I disagree. While the extended action sequence is a fan’s wet dream, Luke plays the role he needs to. He’s a walking, talking story beat that’s required to bring Din and Grogu’s journey to a conclusion. They are still the emotional and narrative focus of the scene, and Luke needs to prove himself a Jedi to allow Din to feel comfortable letting Grogu go with him. I was wary of the show bringing in such a major character but I feel Luke’s limited appearance and actions worked well to aid and conclude the story being told. He was servicing the show, not the other way around. But I’ve got to be honest, I did not care for how he looked.\nThe CGI face was terrible and worse than Tarkin in Rogue One, which just celebrated its 4th anniversary. The de-aging technology was working overtime. He didn’t look a day over 25 pixels. Although, I doubt it was de-aging technology and more just a recreation of young Mark Hamill’s face placed on top of a new actor’s face, with old audio being reused but not exactly matching the mouth movements. The videogame-ness of it all wasn’t a deal breaker for me but it was very distracting and made what should have been an incredible moment quite awkward. I’m fine with this technology being used if it looks good, but if it’s between what we got and recasting the role with a lookalike actor (such as the Internet’s favourite choice Sebastian Stan) then I might have plucked for the recasting. But at least R2-D2 didn’t look any different. I might have been more excited to see the droid than I was the Jedi.\nWhat I found truly powerful about the end of this season is that, despite everything going to plan, it almost feels like a defeat. We lost Grogu again! Just five minutes after getting him back. I was not expecting that to happen. I was anticipating a Jedi appearing in the finale but I thought Din wouldn’t hand the kid over. That he had accepted his role as a father rather than just a protector and would keep Grogu. I thought the rescue would put everything into perspective for him and he would never let him go. But he does, and I’m not exactly sure how I feel about that. It’s powerful yet devastating. The final moments between Din and Grogu are some of the most emotional in Star Wars, and one of the characters is just a tiny puppet! Seeing Grogu gaze upon Din’s face and be the first being to touch it since his parents died when he was a boy was perfect. It’s a heart-breaking ending.\nIs this a narrative dead-end or just the end of this part of the narrative? Will the show now have to find some contrived way to bring Din and Grogu back together after Favreau has written them into a corner, or was the ‘Lone Wolf and Cub’ plot only meant to be an introduction to series, developing Din for whatever the show now becomes? I’m desperate to see where the series goes next. I have to believe we’ll see more of Grogu in the show. I mean, we have to, right? This episode has broken me so much I can’t even convince myself of that fact. Hopefully he graduates Jedi school before Ben Solo burns it to the ground. Or maybe Luke brings him back to Din because his attachment to him is dangerously strong, or he’s annoyed that Grogu keeps stealing his blue macarons or something.\nThe possible new direction for the show could be the title itself. Din is now The Mandalorian. The Mandalore. The leader of the race, planet and creed. He bested Gideon in combat and now is the rightful wielder of the Darksaber and the heir to the Throne of Mandalore. In future seasons we could see him try and unite his people and retake the planet. He may not want the job but it’s now his – just like his fatherhood with Grogu. Bo-Katan could remain a begrudging ally or become Din’s enemy, wanting the Darksaber for herself. She began her journey in Star Wars as a terrorist in The Clone Wars before slowly becoming more heroic. I could definitely see her reverting back to her villainous ways. The season finale does a great job of concluding this era of the show and resetting the board for a different kind of story to begin next year.\nBut the episode’s not done yet. After some concept art-less credits, we’re treated to an amazing post credits scene. We not only see Jabba’s Palace but Bib Fortuna now in command of his former Hutt boss’ criminal empire, getting fat on his master’s wealth. Enjoyably, Bib is played by sound editor Matthew Wood, reprising his cameo as the character from The Phantom Menace. A blaster bolt and a cry of “Maclunky” later, Boba Fett now sits on the throne with Fennec by his side. “The Book of Boba Fett. Coming December 2021”. What a cool way to make an announcement. With The Mandalorian also returning next December, will be get two shows side-by-side? Is The Book of Boba Fett a Disney+ film or one-off special? Or is The Book of Boba Fett the subtitle of The Mandalorian season 3 and the show will now shift focus to a new character?\nEither way, I look forward to getting some much-needed answers and development surrounding Boba Fett. His attitude and relationship with honour confused me this season. During the height of the Empire, he was a truly violent and vile individual, but in The Mandalorian he aids Din on his quest to reacquire Grogu. He treats the exchange of armour as an honourable deal in Chapter 14, which I would believe if he didn’t begin that episode by threatening to kill Grogu if Din didn’t do as he asked. That’s not a deal that you have to honour; that’s coldblooded blackmail. Maybe he’s a born again Mandalorian after his escape from the Sarlaac and struggling to restrain his angry, violent side. Now that he rules Jabba’s palace, will he be a good leader or an evil crime lord?\nWhat began as a predictable final episode of the season ended in a way I found truly shocking. I saw everything coming right up until I saw nothing coming. I’m desperate to rewatch the finale and discover how I actually feel about many of the events that happened without this sense of shock hanging over everything. But I know I liked it. A lot. The finale has opened up a wealth of new storytelling options but also had a sense of finality. It almost felt more like a series finale than just a season finale. It’s a bold decision to remove the money-making merchandise machine that is Grogu from the show, which also eliminates the core emotional relationship too of the series too. I’m not exactly sure where it goes from here but I can’t wait to find out.\nWhat did you think of Chapter 16: The Rescue?

            "text": "As quickly as it began, it's over. The Mandalorian season 3 finale continues this season's theme as a mostly enjoyable yet often frustrating episode. There are some incredible emotional highs, and some head-scratching lows that lack any credible defense.\nMost fans were confident coming off of the emotional thrill ride of last week's penultimate episode that we were heading for an all-time finale. While there's still enjoyment to be found, especially for those with attachment to the characters, by and large the highs of this episode are unfortunately bogged down by a succinct runtime and confusing narrative decisions.\n*Warning: Spoilers ahead for The Mandalorian season 3 finale*\nWhat feels off in The Mandalorian season 3 finale?\nIf you can look past some indefensible choices in this episode, it has a lot to offer. Some people won't have a problem doing this, and others will. As someone who enjoys this finale, I won't push back against anyone who doesn't, because it definitely has issues. While this may be a really fun 38 minutes of Star Wars, it doesn't fit the mold of a good episode of television.\nAt the end of the last episode, when Din Djarin (Pedro Pascal) is captured by Moff Gideon (Giancarlo Esposito) and his Imperialorians, we're led to believe it could spell disaster for either Din or his rescuer. Actor Brendan Wayne, who is the in-suit double for Pedro Pascal, even took to Instagram to say: “the finale could hurt too much.” This proves not to be the case, as less than five minutes in, Grogu shows up and rescues him with little to no resistance. Don't get me wrong, I will never advocate for less Grogu, but this raises a number of questions and makes downright no sense.\nWhy is Din captured in the first place if the plan is to resolve it 4:18 into the next episode? But more importantly, how did Grogu even reach Din? He's last seen escaping with his fellow Mandalorians after Din's capture, and then he just…shows up? Did he fight his way through, sneak around, or did someone help him? What should be a densely emotional moment is moderately weighed down because it just doesn't make sense.\nAnother bone to pick with this episode: who in the world are the spies? It's been a week of theory juggling between The Armorer (Emily Swallow) and Axe Woves (Simon Mario Kassianides), which ultimately amounts to nothing—we never find out who is feeding intel to Elia Kane (Katy O'Brian). This isn't a case of exceedingly high fan expectations, it's just poor storytelling, given last week's episode is quite literally titled “The Spies”.\nThe Mandalorian season 3 finale has showstopping highs and infuriating lows\nFortunately, The Mandalorian season 3 finale isn't all woes and weird choices. This episode contains some of the series'—and dare I say franchise's—best action scenes. Whether it's Bo-Katan (Katee Sackhoff) flying around and dicing up enemies with the Darksaber, or Din Djarin going hand-to-hand against the most deadly troopers (in a scene that feels heavily inspired by a John Wick movie), it's all top-notch fight choreography.\nHowever, the glorious action scenes aren't where this episode shines. We finally get back to what made everyone fall in love with this show in the first place: Din and Grogu, and the bond that they share. This is their show. They are not simply pieces to be moved around as a part of a bigger story. Din Djarin is the Mandalorian in the title card, and Grogu is his son. The only downside is it takes Favreau and Filoni eight episodes to realize where their bread is buttered.\nThe feeling of pure joy and emotion when Din rescues Grogu from the Praetorian Guards is a high that can only be achieved through the outlet of their connection. The pair fighting side by side, Din using his fists and blasters, and Grogu using the force to distract and create openings for his dad is one of the true highlights of Star Wars history. When Din Djarin makes the choice to officially adopt Grogu, now reborn as Mandalorian apprentice Din Grogu, (that's going to take some getting used to) as his son at the end of the episode: let's just say the tears were flowing.\nI cannot overstate what these two characters and their bond mean to me. When they're separated, I long to see them find their way back to each other; whether the time apart is episodes long or seasons long, the reunion hits just as hard every time. Din Djarin and Grogu are a beautiful reminder of how friendship can be forged in the most unlikely places, and a shining example of a touching father-son dynamic.\nStories hold incredible power, and if anyone ever tells you, “you shouldn't care so much, it's all just made up,” or tries to make fun of you—don't listen to them and keep believing.\nHow does The Mandalorian season 3 finale fit into the season as a whole?\nThe simple answer is: not very well. Yet another theme of this season is that the episodes are fine, even fun, if they exist in a vacuum; but they do not. Each episode within a season of The Mandalorian is tasked with telling a meaningful story for Din and Grogu, while advancing the overarching plot. Only about half of the episodes in this season are able to achieve that. We're left with a story that feels cobbled together.\nBecause season three hasn't featured Din and Grogu as the central characters nearly as much as its predecessors, it's a bit jolting to see them return to the spotlight in such an obvious way. Bo-Katan is a major player throughout the entire season, but in The Mandalorian season 3 finale her only important task is to help Din and Grogu.\nThis wouldn't be a problem if she were more of a side character throughout, but her commanding presence in previous episodes force her conclusion in The Mandalorian season 3 finale to feel lackluster and hollow. For many fans, this has been an irritating season of The Mandalorian due to its change in structure, larger scale story, and confusing creative choices.\nYou can't please everyone, so it's only natural that some people are going to love it, and others aren't. It's important to keep one thing in mind: it's okay to have differing opinions on this. If you choose to engage in conversation with those who disagree with you, make sure to approach it with an open mind, and kindness in your heart. There are enough toxic fandoms out there, don't be a contributor to them.\nThis is the Way\nThe Mandalorian season 3 finale is far from perfect. If you go in expecting a well-written and well-paced story that connects with the previous installment, answers questions meaningfully, and resolves season-long storylines, you won't find it.\nWhat you will find is a lovely, heartwarming wrap-up with a delightfully happy ending to a largely confusing, but still very fun season of television. I'm on record having issues with this season, but I'll go on record again here and say the highs outweigh the lows—for this episode, and the season at large.\nNo one knows when we'll see Din Djarin and Grogu again, but given their history with Ahsoka Tano, it's not unreasonable to think they could make an appearance in her upcoming Disney+ show. Additionally, Lucafilm announced at Star Wars Celebration London that the Mandoverse will conclude with a movie directed by Dave Filoni. If the pair miss out on an invitation to the Ahsoka party, our bet is on this project.\nIn the meantime, fans will be anxiously anticipating an announcement for The Mandalorian season four, a Bo-Katan spinoff, or any project we're guaranteed to see our favorite father-son duo.\nThe Mandalorian season 3 finale is now streaming exclusively on Disney+.

            "text": "Season three of Disney+’s Star Wars spin-off The Mandalorian has come to a satisfyingly spectacular conclusion after its now-standard eight-episode run. Swashes were buckled, nerfs were herded and rights were wronged. Baby Yoda / Grogu was adorable, Pedro Pascal’s Din Djarin was enigmatic and cool, Katie Sackhoff’s Bo-Katan kicked ass, the Empire was defeated and all was well. This is the way.\nSo why have fans been complaining? According to several reports this season has been the lowest rated so far in fan reviews, and for the first time since the show’s 2019 debut it has, admittedly, felt less essential and less exciting, a feeling that the stats appear to back up. But why? And is that fair?\nWe’ll start with the last question. Has this season of The Mandalorian been that bad? Well… not really. Pound for pound there’s been some really good stuff. The set pieces have been stunning, pretty much from the word go – the dogfight in ‘Chapter 17: The Apostate’, the season opener, was great. The big Mandos vs Troopers smackdown in the finale was as good as any battle the series has given us so far. The season had a nice, self-contained arc – reuniting the Mandalorian tribes and retaking their homeworld – that broadened the in-universe pallet with new planets and characters and deeper takes on existing lore. There’s been dozens of great touches.\nWhat’s more, the two most divisive episodes of the season were, for my money, two of the best. ‘Chapter 19: The Convert’ took us on a diversion to Coruscant to see the lives of former Imperial agents “deprogrammed” and rehabilitated by the galaxy’s post-Imperial New Republic. It had more in common with last year’s darker, more grown-up Andor, sure, but it also helped to deepen our understanding of this Star Wars era, and it had plenty of twists and turns of its own.\nMeanwhile ‘Chapter 22: Guns for Hire’ went the other way, dropping Mando, Grogu and Bo-Katan onto a new planet to solve an adventure-of-the-week, with cameo performances from Lizzo, Jack Black and Christopher Lloyd. It felt very prequel-era, with its bright colours, elaborate costumes, digital sets and battle droids. This was a diversion into another type of Star Wars, one that’s always been in the DNA of the franchise.\nFar from spoiling the series, these two episodes felt like they pushed at the edges of what the show could be, acknowledging that Star Wars has always been a wide Galaxy, one that could contain both Ewok treehouse parties and psychological “mind-flaying”; that could have Threepio’s head being pulled along by R2-D2, moaning that “this is such a drag” in one movie, and burning Luke Skywalker’s Uncle Owen and Aunt Beru to a crisp and showing us their charred remains in another.",

            "text": "Fans of The Mandalorian are divided after the finale of season three.\n*This article includes spoilers*\nThe last episode of the third season was released on Disney+ this morning (April 19), and has already divided fans over its surprisingly optimistic conclusion.\nIn ‘The Return’, Grogu and Bo Katan Kryze (played by Katee Sackhoff) pursue their mission to rescue the show’s lead character Din Djarin (played by Pedro Pascal) — who was captured by the antagonist Moff Gideon (Giancarlo Esposito) in last week’s episode.\nUsing Grogu’s powers with the force and both Din Djarin and Bo Katan’s strengths as Mandalorian warriors, the trio finally defeat the villain and reclaim the planet Mandalore for their people.\nDrawing the season to a close, the episode ends on an upbeat note and viewers see Din formally adopting Grogu as his child and giving him the name Din Grogu. The pair are also given a home in a cabin by the character of Greef Karga – played by Carl Weathers.\nHowever, many fans have been left divided by the conclusion. While some have hailed the episode for the heartwarming ending, others have lashed out at the writers and creators for an overall “average” and “anti-climactic” season.\n“I can’t believe The Mandalorian has gotten away with being so anti-climactic just by distracting everyone with baby Yoda,” one viewer wrote on Twitter. Another agreed, adding, “The Mandalorian finale was kinda average, if we’re being honest. Love the show still, but a bit of a disappointing season.”\nHowever, some fans of the Star Wars series were quick to disagree – “You mean to tell me Bo-Katan got the main character treatment for the season and actually made it out at the end oh we truly won today,” said one user. Find more reactions from fans below.\nI'll wait until next week to talk about the season finale of The Mandalorian, but I will admit I was kind of let down. I'm not blaming the actors, and I'm not going to blame the writers and directors, either. I think the problem lies in off-screen issues.\n— Raven (@HistoricalNoOne) April 19, 2023\nnever let it be said that that was not the mandalorian season 3 finale\n— Rollin Bishop (@rollinbishop) April 19, 2023\nI can’t believe The Mandalorian has gotten away with being so anticlimatic just by distracting everyone with baby yoda. I won’t say it wasn’t well played\n— leslie rodriguez (@leslienicholee) December 7, 2019\nThe Mandalorian finale was kinda average, if we're being honest.\nLove the show still, but a bit of a disappointing season.\nBring on Ahsoka.\n— Chad Ryan (@ChadwikoTWW) April 19, 2023\n#TheMandalorian spoilers\n.\n.\n.\n.\ndin officially adopting grogu as his son, everyone alive and well, mandalorians retook their world, din and grogu got their happy ending i cant believe this is my life pic.twitter.com/7qmn5GW3rw\n— succession lockdown (@JOELSMILLRR) April 19, 2023\nthe mandalorian spoilers\n.\n.\n.\n“You are now Din Grogu.

While the finale wasn't as climatic and intense as how people were teasing it to be, it was still a good finale. The last 10 minutes was a beautiful way to end the season.#TheMandalorian pic.twitter.com/l0NbCMo4dU\n— Matt 🇳🇴 (@thcfastestman) April 19, 2023\nLast week, following the penultimate episode of the season, the series received more negative reviews from fans highlighting its “massive drop in quality”.\nSince the new season launched, user review scores have consistently plummeted – seen as user reviews on Rotten Tomatoes dropped from an average of 90 per cent in previous seasons to just 57 per cent since in season three.\nThe lowest reviews came from an episode entitled ‘Guns For Hire’, which starred guest cameos from Lizzo, Jack Black and Christopher Lloyd. Following its launch, fans criticised everything about the episode – ranging from unconvincing special effects to the leading character, Din Djarin, being overshadowed by Bo Katan.",

            "text": "The Mythosaur made its appearance right before the end of The Mandalorian Season 3 finale, much to everyone’s surprise.\nThe last installment in The Mandalorian Season 3 was a ride for Din Djarin and Grogu, who had a lot on their plate as they dealt with Moff Gideon and the Praetorian Guard in a thrilling clash. When the dust settled, and our heroes managed to save their lives, The Armorer “baptized” Grogu in the Living Waters in the mines of Mandalore, where Din Grogu — his new name as a Mandalorian apprentice — waken up the mythological creature known as the mythosaur.\nWhat’s the Mythosaur\nThe mythosaur is a dragon-like creature that has become an important symbol of strength and power for the Mandalorian people in Star Wars. The beast has incredible powers and its hide is so tough that it can resist blaster fire. According to the legend, Mandalore the Great tamed and rode a mythosaur, which had a lair in the mines of Mandalore, the same place where Mandalorians extracted their precious beskar. Even during the events of the rise and fall of the Empire, warriors such as Boba Fett displayed a mythosaur skull emblem on their armor.\nIn “Chapter 24: The Return,” the mythosaur briefly appeared after Grogu bathed in the Living Waters on Mandalore. Din Djarin’s apprentice had already demonstrated an affinity for the Force and a strong connection with other creatures. In the Season 3 finale, he just reached out to the mythosaur, apparently using the Force, which awakened the creature. Fans already saw Grogu has a special bond with certain animals, and he’s also resorting to the Force to protect Din Djarin, like when he saved Mando from a Mudhorn in the second episode of the first season. That was also the first time the show teased Grogu’s powerful connection with the Force. Most importantly, he seems to be able to tame animals when they’re enraged, as seen when he put to sleep Boba Fett’s rancor in The Book of Boba Fett finale.\nWhen Did the Mythosaur First Appear?\nThe mythosaur first appeared in The Mandalorian Season 3 Episode 2. In “Chapter 18: The Mines of Mandalore,” Djarin achieved his goal of bathing in the Living Waters. The journey there was full of perils, and the titular hero needed to ask for Bo-Katan’s help. After saving her fellow Mandalorian from an obstinate robot, Bo-Katan offered to lead Djarin to the Living Waters. Once there, Djarin took a bath while reciting the words of the Creed of the Mandalore to purify himself from the sin of having removed his helmet in front of others. Suddenly, Djarin fell, and Bo-Katan dove to save him into the deep waters. Djarin looked to have passed away, but Bo-Katan could see a horn and the keen eye of the mythosaur while resurfacing.\nThe Mandalorian had already mentioned the legendary creature before when Ugnaught Kuiil needed to motivate Djarin during his training to ride blurrgs, reminding him that his ancestors rode mythosaurs. The Armorer also mentioned it in The Book of Boba Fett when she told Djarin that a mythosaur rising would herald a “new age of Mandalore.” Apparently, that time has finally come.",

            "text": "The Mandalorian Season 3 has come to an end in a way that will be satisfying for fans – even those who have found issues with it.\nNever doubt Dave Filoni and Jon Favreau is the moral of the story when it comes to The Mandalorian season 3 episode 8. This finale has a whole lot of action, some huge reveals, and quite a bit of heart.\nWarning: Spoilers Ahead for The Mandalorian Season 3 Episode 7.\nThe Mandalorian season 3 episode 7 set up for what we all knew was going to be an action packed, epic finale. And that is exactly what we got. Moff Gideon may have captured Din Djarin, but everyone who has been watching this show since the beginning knows he can get himself out of any pickle. And get out of this pickle he did.\nOf course he had the help of Grogu, who was still hanging out inside of IG-12 at this point. After that, he enlists the help of R5 to get through the shields leading down the hallway that fans saw Moff Gideon go down last episode.\nStar Wars has had some pretty epic hallway fight scenes, but watching Din take out two guards at a time as R5 strategically lowers each shield really takes the cake as one of the most entertaining.\nThe Clones Revealed\nFor those who have been wondering exactly what Moff Gideon had up his sleeve in regards to cloning, that plan was revealed in the finale. While Grogu and Din are hunting him down they come across a room filled with Gideon clones.\nLater on, Moff Gideon reveals these to have been infused with The Force, the one thing that he lacks. He thought he was going to raise an unstoppable army, however Din Djarin had other plans. With a few clicks on the keyboard, he destroyed them all. Moff Gideon certainly was not happy about that, adding another reason for him to hate Mandalorians.\nThe Darksaber Is No More\nAll of The Mandalorians come together to fight Moff Gideon’s forces in the season 3 finale. There are multiple fights happening at once. When Gideon confronts Din Djarin and Grogu, it doesn’t take long for them to be separated. The Praetorian Guards force Grogu into another room, while Din is left to take on Moff Gideon.\nHowever, once Bo-Katan arrives to help, he is free to go save his son – her words. Grogu and Din Djarin take down the Praetorian Guards in what should have been a much easier battle. Eventually Grogu uses The Force against them, but it takes him a bit longer than it should have to play that card.\nMeanwhile Bo-Katan and Moff Gideon have a long overdue battle, in which he shockingly destroys the Darksaber. He absolutely crushes it in one swift action. While it feels like he shouldn’t be able to do this, it is a brilliant way to take that weapon off the table.\nThe Mandalorians join together to take down the rest of Gideon’s troops while Din, Gorgu, and Bo-Katan team up to take him on. Axe, who sent the Mandalorians down to fight, is alone inside the Starship they took control of. He crashes it, purposefully, into the ground where Moff Gideon is. Grogu uses The Force to protect himself, Bo-Katan, and Din Djarin, and Moff Gideon seems to be destroyed, yet again.\nFinally True Family\nWith Mandalore successfully back in the hands of the Mandalorians, the forge is relit. Paz Vizsla’s son takes the creed in the Living Waters and Grogu attempts to. The Armorer stops him, claiming since he is not able to talk, he cannot move on from foundling to apprentice.\nDin Djarin points out that a foundling’s parent can do that for them, and vows to adopt Grogu as his son so that he can be his apprentice. The Armorer allows this and says he shall now be known as Din Grogu.\nThe two travel meet up with Captain Teva so that Din Djarin can ask for work. He wishes to be a bounty hunter for the New Republic on a case by case basis. Next stop for the duo is Nevarro, where Greef Karga hands over the deed to the cabin he promised Din Djarin at the start of the season. The final shot of the season shows Din Djarin relaxing on the front porch while Din Grogu plays with a frog.\nOverall Thoughts\nThis season of The Mandalorian has been very hit or miss. It has had a lot of high highs, and a lot of low lows. As it wraps up with an action packed finale, there are also quite a bit of heartfelt moments weaved in. That said, this feels like a solid ending for the series as a whole.\nThat isn’t to say there are not many adventures that could go on from here for Din Djarin and Din Grogu, because of course there are. It just also seems like things could come to an end here and fans would be satisfied. I am not sure if that is a good thing or a bad thing, or just a fact.\nThankfully the season wrapped up on a positive note, with a fantastic episode. And I truly cannot wait to see what happens next.\nThe Mandalorian season 3 is now streaming in its entirety on Disney+.\nRating: 8/10 SPECS\nThis article was produced and syndicated by Wealth of Geeks.\nTessa Smith owns MamasGeeky.com and is a Rotten Tomatoes Tomatometer-approved Film and TV Critic and a huge geek.

They reach a dead end and the survivors tell her that they know of a place to hunker down.\nShe tells Axe about the Imperial fighters and bombers heading for the capital ship before the connection is cut off. As soon as Axe reaches outer space, he tells the rest of the Mandalorians to get on the drop ships while he uses the light cruiser as a decoy.\nDin Djarin is taken to a different location but he manages to fight off his captors. They appear to gain the upper hand until Grogu shows up in IG-12 and helps him defeat the Imperial commandos.\nMoff Gideon knows that Djarin has escaped and says that he’ll deal with the problem on his own. Djarin calls out to R5 and asks it to connect to the mainframe and find out where Gideon’s command center is.\nAfter beating several commandos, Djarin and Grogu arrive at a room with several tanks. These tanks contain clones of Moff Gideon inside them and Djarin makes sure they are destroyed before moving on.\nBo-Katan and the others are taken to an underground cavern filled with plant life and the survivors explain that these are farms planted by them and all of these plants are endemic to the planet.\nThe Armorer arrives with the rest of the army and they head back to the Imperial base. Djarin and Grogu reach the command center and Gideon confronts them.\nHe discloses that those clones were created to be better versions of him because they had the Force within them but Djarin destroyed their chances of survival before their first breaths.\nHe then faces off with the Din Djarin, eventually joined by the praetorian guards. Grogu pulls the attention of the guards away as Gideon and Djarin continue to combat each other.\nThe other Mandalorians fight the commandos in a massive dogfight as numbers on both sides fall.

Bo-Katan retorts that she has her fellow people by her side which is when Djarin shows up to assist her.\nShe fights him alongside Djarin and Grogu when Axe Woves contacts them with the message that he’s crashing the capital ship into the base.\nAll the other Mandalorians evacuate while Bo-Katan and Djarin are saved from the explosion thanks to a Force shield from Grogu. Moff Gideon is engulfed in the explosion and perishes.\nWhat happens to Mandalore?\nThe Mandalorians reclaim their planet as Bo-Katan lights the flame of the Great Forge once again. The members of the Children of the Watch take the Creed in the Living Waters with Ragnar Vizsla officially taking his oath.\nDjarin takes Grogu to the waters so that he can take the Creed but the Armorer says that he is too young. Djarin asks if he could with his parent’s permission and then announces that he will accept Grogu as his son.\nThe Armorer accepts his claim and dubs Grogu as Din Grogu, Din Djarin’s Mandalorian apprentice.\nWhat lies ahead for Djarin and Grogu?\nDjarin visits Carson Teva and tells him that since Grogu is now his apprentice, he wants to be selective of his work and offers to take care of Outer Rim problems for the New Republic off the books.\nTeva agrees and Djarin says that in return he would like the head of a defunct assassin droid they see in the bar. He then visits Greef Karga who gifts Djarin with a cabin on the outskirts of the city where he can spend his downtime.\nDjarin reveals that he has a gift of his own as IG-11 appears, fully restored to its old self and announcing that it will be the new marshall of the city.\nDjarin is then seen relaxing on his front porch as Grogu plays with a creature from the pond outside, both of them happy with whatever is in store for their future.\nReview\n- The season finale has a genuine cinematic feel about it with all the action that takes place. Visually there is a lot going on in the episode and all of it is magnificent.\n- The sound is equally up to the mark and Ludwig Göransson and Joseph Shirley deserve major props for this episode and how they built up the excitement.\n- From a narrative perspective, the fact that Moff Gideon was making clones of himself with the Force embedded within them felt undercut but how close to the end they left it. As soon as it was introduced, it was shut off with the explanation coming immediately after.\n- The Mandalorian season 3 culminates wonderfully in this finale with everything being wrapped up in a satisfactory fashion.\nThe Mandalorian season 3 episode 8\nDirector: Rick Famuyiwa\nDate Created: 2023-04-19 12:30\n4\nAlso Read: The Mandalorian season 3 episode 7 recap & review: The Spies",

The show is like having an Oh Henry or your favorite candy you haven’t had in a very long time again. You forget how good they were until it’s in you.\nEpisode number two, season three is dark, like hard to see dark.\nWe finally make it to the planet Mandalore and find it destroyed as legend has foretold. Along with a rad history lesson on all things Mandalorian, Bo Katan (Katee Sackhoff) has been brought back into the fold to rescue our hero.\nAs mentioned it’s visually dark, so dark in fact that many fans are complaining they could not see the landscape and terrain of the planet. The ravaged planet comes complete with a lake Titicaca water-style structure for our hero to redeem himself in. Was he successful?\nGrogu is starting to “talk” and it’s ultra mega cute.\nAs the story moves forward, Din Djarin continues to teach our favorite youngling “The Way.” Space travel, reading maps, using droids, and wait…. did he just talk? A Special highlight for me was the neat little flip Grogu would do while exiting a spaceship. Growing stronger in the force this one is, but will he become a Jedi?\nThe villain of this episode was a keen throwback to the Mustafarian creatures with a nod to General Grievous. Part mechanical with a brain and eye operating the robotic bodies.\nMore easter eggs include our second favorite Astro mech droid R5 D4 and the celebration of Bonta Eve as shown in the pod race scene during The Phantom Menace.\nWill R5 D4 rise to R2 fame and are there more throwback creatures on Mandalore?\nWhy should you keep watching the Mandalorian?\nBeing an old-school Star Wars fan, I’m really enjoying the “buddy flick” style of storytelling. Two dudes taking on the universe. I also feel the room for growth with both the main characters and supporting characters is huge. Whether you know it or not, “these are the droids you are looking for”. The ones that have huge characters with depth and room for continued growth through stellar writers and pro actors.\nIs Grogu the future of the Star Wars universe? Let’s Hope!\nKeep it real my galaxy from far, far away! Real interesting.\nCatch “Live from Machete Comics” Every Monday night on the Crier Media Network at 9 pm Est!",

            "text": "I went into tonight’s third-season finale of The Mandalorian both wanting and expecting a lot of things, and I don’t think I got that many of them. And yet, I can’t really come up with a good reason why I should feel as unsatisfied as I do.\n“Chapter 24 – The Return” certainly tidies up many of the plot threads that season three of the smash-hit Disney+ live-action Star Wars series set up during its eight-episode run, but at the same time it delivered much more action than information. And maybe that’s why I walked away from my first time watching this finale with something of a hollow feeling in my gut.\n“The Return” picks up where the previous episode, “The Spies” (I still don’t understand that title, as its plurality was not addressed whatsoever this week, despite many fans– including myself– assuming it would be) left off: with Bo-Katan Kryze (Katee Sackhoff) and her Mandalorian allies battling the force of Imperial warlord Moff Gideon (Giancarlo Esposito) in his secret base on the planet Mandalore. There’s some great-looking fight choreography between the Mandos and Gideon’s beskar-armored jet-troopers, and then we check in on a captive Din Djarin (Pedro Pascal), who quickly breaks free and declares that Gideon must die or his and Grogu’s struggles will never end. It’s a frustrating way to immediately undo one of last week’s cliffhangers, but this episode seems to be more about cleanup than payoff. Din puts R5-D4 into action remotely helping them break into Gideon’s command center but not before battling more troopers and taking out a dozen or so pods full of Gideon clones– in the episode’s only big reveal, we get confirmation that the Moff was indeed attempting to give himself Force powers using Dr. Pershing’s research.\nMeanwhile, Axe Woves (Simon Kassianides) jetpacks up to the Mandalorian fleet in orbit around the planet and calls down reinforcements to help in the battle, while he himself pilots the flagship down toward the Imperial base, kamikaze-style. On the surface, Bo-Katan is shown a garden of plants growing in an underground cave– I’m gonna have to watch this episode again just to figure out what the point of this scene was, I guess to show that repopulating Mandalore won’t be as difficult as once suspected?– and Grogu proves his mettle by going up against the Praetorian Guards that took out poor Paz Vizsla last week. There’s a bunch more action, both Din and Bo fight Gideon to varying levels of success, and eventually the base blows up from the crashing Light Cruiser, with Grogu ultimately saving himself and his friends from certain death by creating a protective bubble with the Force. This is all fine, story-wise, but it also feels a little rushed and lacking any real threat or complications along the way, almost like the powers that be at The Mandalorian just kinda wanted to get this season over with. Anyway, the denouement sees Bo-Katan and the Armorer (Emily Swallow) working together to settle Mandalore again– I guess all those theories are out the window– and Din officially adopting Grogu as his son and apprentice.\nThen our heroes travel to Adelphi Base to meet with Carson Teva (Paul Sun-Hyung Lee) to pitch the idea of working as bounty hunters for the New Republic, while also grabbing a discarded assassin-droid head from the bar while they’re there. Next it’s off to Nevarro, where Greef Karga (Carl Weathers) bestows Din Djarin and Din Grogu– yep, that’s what we’re calling him now– with a nice little homestead, and in exchange IG-11 (voiced by Taika Waititi) returns as the much-needed new marshal of the planet. This is what I mean about everything just feeling a little too tidy, like I kept waiting for another shoe to drop, though it never did. There was no tease for Star Wars: Ahsoka, no hint of a second season of The Book of Boba Fett, and no mention of Thrawn at all, even after last week seemed to set up a conflict between Gideon and the Grand Admiral. I think “underwhelming” might be a good word to describe “The Return” as a finale and The Mandalorian season three as a whole. It’s definitely the most uneven batch of episodes that the series has delivered so far, but at the same time it took some daring chances in the middle of the season that I actually admire quite a bit, even if they weren’t always home runs. What bugs me most about the finale is the opposite of that: in packing everything away in neat little boxes it comes across as by-the-numbers and safe, instead of new and exciting like the best hours of this show– including last week’s episode– have been. At the end of season two I couldn’t wait to see what happened next, and here I’ll just kind of shrug my shoulders, turning my attention toward Ahsoka.\nAll three seasons of The Mandalorian are now streaming in their entirety, exclusively via Disney+.",

            "text": "The Mandalorian Season 3’s Finale Will ‘Hurt’ Says Star\nThe Mandalorian actor Brendan Wayne says season 3’s final episode ‘might hurt’ fans of the Star Wars series. It goes without saying that Chapter 23: The Spies was one of the best episodes in the entire run of season 3. The Mandalorians now have a focus on retaking Mandalore. But it ends at an intense cliffhanger. With one remaining episode to go, we can’t wait to see how it all ends.\nThree people are responsible for bringing the character of Din Djarin to life on The Mandalorian. Pedro Pascal provides the face and the voice. The physical performance is shared between Lafeef Crowder, a stunt coordinator and performer, and Brendan Wayne, an actor and skilled gunslinger.\nThe Season Finale Could Be A Pivotal Moment To The Mandalorian\nREAD MORE: Din Djarin Is No Longer The Mandalorian, Confirms Producer\nIn an Instagram story posted by Brendan Wayne, he posted:\nThis next episode is gonna make you wish you hadn’t asked for [another episode]. It might just hurt too much.\nSince we don’t really know what to expect from the next episode at this point, we presume that it might be an emotional episode. To what extent, we don’t know. Will someone else die? Someone already did in the previous one. Is it going to be another cliffhanger? Are we going to see Thrawn? Or are the Rebels or Luke going to show up? Is something going to happen to Din Djarin, to Grogu or Bo-Katan?\nLet’s hope that this doesn’t turn up like Game of Thrones, where the main leads die. Then again, we have seen Qui-Gon Jinn, Obi-Wan, and Padme die onscreen. Even in the animated shows, we’ve seen major characters die. So, it can happen.\nAt the moment, Brendan Wayne gave us more questions than answers. It’s a good way to hype up the episode, though.\nNevertheless, it does seem that Dave Filoni, executive producer and writer of The Mandalorian has prepared something big for the fans. He said in an interview with Collider:\nThey’ll [fans] have a lot to take in, and I think with any good ending there’s the moment you’re in it when you’re cheering and you feel satisfied, but then there’s a little bit after that where you think back at all the things that happened. Maybe you start to put them together in a different way and you realize it’s an ending, but there are other things happening out there in the galaxy that now you know more about.\nMandalorian Actor Says That The Finale Will Hurt\nREAD MORE: Kathleen Kennedy Forced Jon Favreau To Reunite Grogu And Din Djarin In Book Of Boba Fett\nIt does seem that the slow start of the series will be coming to a mighty end. We did say before that Season 3 felt like it was struggling to get its footing. The last episode was an amazing comeback for the season.\nIt appears that all the pieces of the puzzle we’ve seen in this season of The Mandalorian might finally come together in the finale. If that’s the case, then the show’s third season could be worth rewatching to appreciate the connections and how everything fits together fully.\nBrendan Wayne, an actor with a career spanning back to 2001, is the son of the legendary actor John Wayne. Although he’s primarily had smaller roles, he’s worked on some intriguing projects such as Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., The Mentalist, Sons of Anarchy, Cowboys & Aliens, and Fast & Furious, among others.\nWhat do you think of Brendan Wayne’s Instagram post about the last episode of The Mandalorian season 3?

            "text": "“Chapter 24” of The Mandalorian didn’t just end the show’s third season. The action-packed finale also served as a reset for the entire series. Mandalorians are finally back home and united, even without the Darksaber. Moff Gideon is (seemingly) dead. And the Shadow Council no longer has a base of operations on Mandalore. Din Djarin and his son can now live a quiet life on Nevarro when they’re not busy on adventures. But the episode, which resolved multiple major plot lines without teasing any other spinoffs, did more than restore The Mandalorian to its original format. It also served as the beginning of an end. It’s the beginning of the end we know is coming for this era of connected Disney+ live-action Star Wars shows.\nDin Djarin and Din Grogu are going back out on their own after the defeat of Moff Gideon. Their peoples are home again and Grogu is officially an adopted Mandalorian. He needs to learn how to navigate the galaxy. Grogu’s apprenticeship—as Greef Karga’s on-the-nose analysis laid out—means the pair is now ready to return to their original way of life together. They will serve as independent contractors for the New Republic dealing with Imperial remnants on a “case-by-case” basis. That new/old bounty hunter lifestyle will also bring the series back to its season one and two roots. The Mandalorian will once again be the Lone Wolf and Cub in space after season three focused on the franchise’s larger stories.\nEven if Din and Grogu don’t have to worry about Mandalore or Moff Gideon ever again, those larger stories aren’t over. Not for them or the galaxy. In the great tradition of Star Wars, which began with a trilogy, the credits rolling on one “episode” doesn’t mean the end of what the characters are dealing with. And the largest issue hanging over the period of The Mandalorian will play a monumental role on its next live-action spinoff, Ahsoka.\nGrand Admiral Thrawn, whose return the Shadow Council awaits, is coming. His return has been Ahsoka Tano’s focus since she made her live-action debut on The Mandalorian. She’s right to worry about it. Thrawn’s reemergence also presages the coming of Snoke and Palpatine some day. Din and Grogu’s work for the New Republic won’t prevent Imperial remnants from regrouping. They will succeed at establishing the Empire as the First Order. And while Thrawn isn’t around for the sequel trilogy, the dangerous, cunning Imperial officer is poised to play a significant role in Palpatine’s resurrection.\nHis role during this time period is what Jon Favreau and Dave Filoni set up to be the next overarching issue of the The Mandalorian universe of shows. It’s also a story poised to be the last one these series tell together.\nFiloni is set to direct his own Star Wars movie. Lucafilm says it “ will focus on the New Republic, and close out the interconnected stories told in The Mandalorian, The Book of Boba Fett, Ahsoka, and other Disney+ series.” We don’t know when that film is coming, but the film’s announcement reveals the end is near for these shows. That inevitable conclusion—described as “big event in this time period”—will start with Ahsoka. No matter how many other seasons we get of it, The Mandalorian, or any other spinoffs, the coming of Thrawn is the coming of the end that began when Din Djarin accepted a bounty that turned out to be Grogu.\nDon’t despair if you hope to see more of the pair’s adventures together. Filoni himself said it will be possible for Din Djarin and Grogu to continue having their adventure even after his film.\nHow can his film end an era launched by The Mandalorian but not the actual show? The same way The Return of the Jedi didn’t mark the end of Luke, Leia, and Han’s story, either. It only marked the end of the original trilogy’s story. Filoni’s film will do the same for the story The Mandalorian and its spinoffs told together. And it’s fitting that end started with a reset to how it all began for Din Djarin and Grogu.\nMikey Walsh is a staff writer at Nerdist. You can follow him on Twitter at @burgermike.

            "text": "Elena (Margherita Mazzucco) looks in the mirror and sees her future self looking back at her, a slight smile on her lips, a simmering sea of contentment. That’s how the third season of My Brilliant Friend comes to a close, trembling with uncertainty and joyful with the promise of a hopeful tomorrow.\nTo entirely unfilter ourselves from the multitude of perceptions that surround us, who build our sense of self, is perhaps impossible. So any moment where you’re able to find yourself and recognize not just who you are, but what you value and deserve, is a triumph. It could be a small moment, one whose very existence feels like a life-changing maelstrom of potential consequences, or somewhere in between. But that triumph remains.\nWith Nino’s (Francesco Serpico) return to her life, Elena is caught between the passionate love affair she desired in her past and the catastrophe of isolation and strangulation her life is in the present. A part of her desires Nino’s greatest strength, his capacity for grand, sweeping romance that makes you feel as if no one could ever love you as much as he loves you in that moment. Yet she also knows, from how he has treated her and Lila (Gaia Girace) in the past, that Nino was incapable of remaining by your side when any sort of difficulty arose. He wouldn’t hold your hand as you navigated the more tumultuous sides of life and instead he would simply detach himself from you and leave you drifting aimlessly, desperately searching for an anchor.\nBut Elena can’t help herself from hoping that Nino had become a better version of himself, a man who was capable of both passion and the capacity to make a decision that centred anyone but him. I couldn’t help myself from wanting that, either, from wanting that little smile that danced in her steps to bloom into a genuine happiness. Her fears are well-recognized however, and in a telling moment, Nino asks her to sacrifice her marriage but refuses to sacrifice his own. The scintillating affair transforms into a question of immense significance.\nHave you thought about demanding what you want? Of course you have. Have you practiced in front of a mirror how you’re going to demand what you deserve? Of course you have. Have you built up the courage to value yourself for who you are and not who others perceive you to be? I hope you have. But it is one thing to think, practice, build up the courage. It is another to act.\nFor as long as she can remember, Elena has felt adrift. Constantly cast in the shadows of who other people have wanted her to be, she had anchored herself to concrete goals that seemed beyond the reach of those expectations. She achieved those goals but those expectations only became greedier and began to consume her piece by piece. Bit by bit they ate away at her sense of self and slowly Elena realized that there wasn’t any shoreline left for her to anchor herself to.\nA part of her knew that she didn’t want the traditions of marriage and motherhood, but sometimes the forces that are pulling us towards something feel more powerful than the ones steering us to where we want to be. In what is perhaps the significant decision of her life, Elena commits to the promise she made to herself at the end of episode six and becomes. She becomes in a significant step the person she wants to be for herself, a person who recognizes what she wants for herself, demands what she wants for herself, and is unapologetic about valuing herself over others for once.\nShe would destroy her marriage if he would destroy his. Nino dithers and flails about, coming up with one excuse after another that proves to Elena that no, she couldn’t rely on him to salvage her life either. She was ready to walk away from it all. Her husband, her kids, her lover. She was ready to walk away from every fragment of a promise and build her own if that’s what it would take. That Nino, after several weeks, comes around and commits, is almost incidental. The important moment is Elena standing up for herself in a way that she almost never has.\nElena looks upon her reflection in the airplane bathroom mirror and for once she sees a future version of her born from a life she was choosing for herself.\nNotes:\n– The window shot in the beginning of the episode was gorgeous\n– Toasting with prosciutto is cute\n– Elena feeling some happiness at the wealthy man whom she had married being brought down by someone from her neighbourhood\n– That beach shot? Exquisite\n– The shot of Elena through the opaque glass is poignant and perfectly understated\n– Pietro’s (Matteo Cecchi) meltdown was a pitch perfect encapsulation of a man who is, at his core, an insecure and abusive partner who only finds value in how others relate to him. A part of him knows that he finds no value in himself as a person and that shows here. That he is heartbroken at the end of his marriage is understandable. That he emotionally and mentally harms his children in coping with that end is inexcusable.\n– The murder of Manuela Solara (Imma Villa) provides a jot of violent shock to the episode and makes us as the audience reflect on how much truth there was to Lila’s claim that she was playing the Solaras and not the other way around\n– Max Richter’s score for the season is, as expected, excellent and is available for your listening pleasure on music streaming and purchasing sites\nBest Quotes:\n– “I wrote about how men invented us so we would always be at their service.”\n– “When you don’t know what you’ve written, it means it’s good work.”\n– “Eve is entirely dependent on Adam, how she is defined as good and evil is through his perception.”\n– “Now eat, defence of the established order can do without you tonight.”\n– “With the excuse of terrorism, they’re criminalizing all dissent.”\n– “He pretended a lot and loved very little.”\nThank you for spending this season with me. I love this show with all of my heart and hope to see you all when its fourth, and final, season premieres in the (hopefully) near future.",

I mean the series itself, which provided an electrifying debut for Disney+ back in 2019 – along with an inspiring blueprint for how to re-invent the then-floundering Star Wars TV/movie universe.\nAs its third season starts, this show faces the real prospect of being eclipsed by a newer, fresher series, amid spreading fan fatigue.\nIt doesn't help that the first two new episodes from this season of The Mandalorian suffer seriously from a malady I call Table Setting Disease.\nThat's what happens when most of the energy in an episode is devoted to getting characters in place to tell the season's real story, while also giving the audience all the background info they need to understand what's going on.\nAnd in this season of The Mandalorian, there is a lot of backstory which needs filling in.\n'Mando' finds a new quest\nAs the first two episodes of the new season begin, Djarin is on a new quest: to atone for breaking the code of the Mandalorians by taking off his helmet and revealing his face to others. (This didn't happen just to show off Pascal's pretty face, though he did it more than once last season. Check out episode seven of the second season to see why Djarin had to break such a sacred Mandalorian rule in the first place. Or why he did it a different time.)\nIt turns out, Djarin was raised as part of a sect of Mandalorians whose customs and beliefs are far more strict than some others. More on that later.\nBut if your consumption of various Disney+ Star Wars series stopped with the last season of The Mandalorian, you might be a tad confused now. That's because important developments for this series happened on another Disney+ Star Wars story, The Book of Boba Fett.\nThe last season of The Mandalorian culminated in a moment Star Wars fans have dreamed about since this series was announced – a de-aged Mark Hamill appeared as his classic Star Wars character Luke Skywalker; a deadly Jedi Knight who tore through a villain's lair filled with robotic bad guys to rescue a young being the Mandalorian had been protecting.\nThis being, known as The Child, fans called Baby Yoda for his resemblance to the green-skinned Jedi master of the films.\nAs the second season finale concluded, The Child (whose name is Grogu) landed with a Jedi who can complete his training in The Force and Djarin fulfilled his quest to find a suitable home for his special young charge. Quest over, series done, right?\nNot so fast. Over several episodes in the Boba Fett series, we see Grogu decide to return to the Mandalorian who had become a father figure to him. (As an aside, there's a serious problem with a spinoff series like Boba Fett, if its best episodes essentially feature another program hijacking the storyline.)\nAnd in the first two episodes of The Mandalorian's new season, we see our pair reunited, with Djarin determined to visit the homeworld of Mandalore and bathe himself in \"living waters\" which will wash away his disgrace.\nFinding a future in Mandalore's past\nAs we are shown in brief flashbacks in this new season, Mandalore was carpet bombed by the Empire, turning the world into a toxic heap of rubble. Djarin has to reconnect with old allies to get back there, including Carl Weathers' Greef Karga, now a wealthy, somewhat obsequious official; Amy Sedaris' weathered, deal-making mechanic Peli Motto and Katee Sackhoff's descendant of Mandalore's royal family, Bo-Katan Kryze.\nYou can practically feel the series' storytelling machinery ponderously cranking into gear through each of these visits. The stopover with Karga allows him to update Djarin – and the audience – on two important characters, Giancarlo Esposito's villainous Moff Gideon and rebel fighter-turned-mercenary Cara Dune, played by Gina Carano, who was fired from the series in 2021 after publishing controversial social media posts.\n(Gideon was sent off to a war tribunal and Dune joined the New Republic's special forces. Gideon is expected to return, but it's unclear what will happen to Dune or whether Carano will play her if the character comes back.)\nA trip to Motto's garage leaves Djarin saddled with a droid that acts an awful lot like the classic Star Wars character R2-D2. And Bo-Katan winds up joining Djarin in action, showing off her skills with the mysterious dark lightsaber he took from Moff Gideon last season and still struggles to wield himself.\nIn each episode, long bouts of exposition explaining who is where or what has to be done are split up with frenetic, expertly shot action sequences, as if the jolt of battle will cause audiences to forget they just spent long minutes learning a bunch of backstory like they signed up for a Star Wars-themed version of Masterclass.\nWhat I loved here, was the deepening bond between Grogu/Baby Yoda and the Mandalorian/Djarin. Here, we are reminded that the Mandalorian's way is a creed that many can adopt — Bo-Katan, in fact, is quite annoyed by the extremist customs of the sect which raised Djarin, known as the Children of the Watch — as the former bounty hunter explains the history and ways of his chosen people to his chosen son in several telling moments.\nBut one of my prescriptions for great TV is simple: Show, don't tell. And there are way too many moments where The Mandalorian has a character telling audiences something it would have been more exciting to show us, making these first two new episodes feel something like the opening setup of a new video game.\nThis creative lull is particularly a problem for The Mandalorian because another Disney+ series set in the Star Wars universe, Andor, landed on many critics' Top 10 lists last year and galvanized fans by offering yet another take on how to move the franchise forward.\nAs a kind of prequel to the film Rogue One, Andor is centered on the story of how the rebel alliance rose to oppose the brutally authoritarian Empire, telling a Star Wars story rooted in the history of Diego Luna's scrappy fighter Cassian Andor. And it avoided many of the pitfalls derailing other Star Wars offshoots by grounding its story in surprising ways.\nNo Jedi Knights. No lightsabers. No mysticism. Nobody uses The Force to get out of a jam. Just hardscrabble, average people willing to risk everything to push back against a punishingly bureaucratic regime.\nSo far, this season of The Mandalorian, packed tight with stories of kingdoms past and challenges to come — setting up a quest which feels decidedly less important than the show's original motivating mission – seems off to a less than compelling start, in comparison.\nBut this Star Wars fan remains hopeful. Because it's often a mistake to judge a video game on the first five minutes of play.",

            "text": "When a Yorkshire drug dealer said “This is the way” in the final season of Happy Valley, it was a sign of the impact The Mandalorian has had since it started Disney+’s pivot into Star Wars TV shows back in 2019. Other series have followed, and some – notably the epic Andor – have been good, but none has had the sort of cultural impact that leads to BBC One dramas quoting your lead character’s catchphrase.\nIf you’re not fully plugged into the Star Wars universe, however, Disney+ has stitched you up by continuing The Mandalorian when you weren’t looking. The show itself has now returned for a third season, but last year’s final three instalments of the otherwise dull spin-off The Book of Boba Fett – which fairweather fans had given up on after the stultifying first episode – formed a crossover story, heavily featuring Din Djarin (Pedro Pascal) AKA the Mandalorian, or Mando to his admirers.\nHe’s been busy! Our man acquired a reconditioned Naboo starfighter, fought to retain his frighteningly powerful new weapon the darksaber, and was reunited with his regular travelling companion Grogu (to devotees of the show, “Baby Yoda”) when the adorable little furball sacked off his Jedi training with Luke Skywalker and chose to ride shotgun with Mando instead. Hardly any of that is in the “Previously … ” montage at the start of the new Mandalorian episode, so for some viewers it’s a double surprise when Mando arrives in a sleek retro set of wings, with Grogu peeping out of a glass dome behind him as his tiny co-pilot, like R2-D2 back in the day.\nThe reappearance of the hero and his cuddly green pal caps off an opening sequence that adds to the show’s long run of exhilarating action sequences with impressive monsters: some Mandalorians are enjoying a lakeside coming-of-age ceremony, but just as a boy is fitted with the armoured helmet that signifies he is now an adult, a gargantuan crocodile-like creature emerges from the water and starts eating the congregation. When all looks lost, Din Djarin zooms in and blasts the thing’s guts out.\nFrom there, the comeback episode continues to dole out a pacy greatest-hits set, packing several signature moves into a half hour that’s chiefly concerned with setting up the new season. After confirmation from the relevant authorities that his decision to remove his helmet in season two means he is now an apostate, Mando takes Grogu to the planet Nevarro to reconnect with old pal Greef Karga (Carl Weathers). Karga informs his visitor that their ally Cara Dune has got a new job and is no longer around, thus solving the mystery of how the actor who played Dune, Gina Carano – fired after a series of strident political tweets – would be written out. Then, pirates arrive, prompting a quick-draw shootout that is, of course, won by Karga and Mando.\nThe Mandalorian regularly features scenes lifted directly from old westerns, with a good lawman and a bad outlaw hovering their fingers over guns in holsters before the villain goes for his weapon, sealing his own fate. In the past, it’s even made use of the classic shot of a man in black approaching the saloon in a dusty one-horse town, filmed through the legs of the sheriff standing his ground out front. In The Mandalorian that horse might have six legs and a glowing horn, but the homage is unmistakable.\nThe Mandalorian is also happy to play around with the eccentricities of Star Wars itself. Still on Nevarro, Mando employs some Anzellans, a race of 4in-high mechanics, to attempt to fix his obliterated old droid friend IG-11. Amid the warm creature cuteness of the Anzellans and Grogu’s attempt to hug them (“No, Grogu! Not a pet!”), a neat gag develops about the miraculous ability Star Wars characters have to converse with aliens: the advice of chief grease monkey Babu Frik, who provided comic relief in 2019’s The Rise of Skywalker when resistance fighters struggled to understand him, morphs from impenetrable gabble to broken English, which the officious Karga keeps translating long after an irritated Mando has learned to understand it.\nHearing Shirley Henderson voicing Babu again is a treat, as is IG-11’s brief return to sentience, which means a spot of extra work for Taika Waititi. The new episode keeps handing out gifts, such as the cracking aerial dogfight that develops when Mando leaves Nevarro and is chased through an asteroid belt by the dead pirates’ disgruntled colleagues. After that’s over, Din Djarin and Grogu set out for Mandalore on a quest for redemption, and if that’s barely got started yet, it’s still a thrill and a pleasure to see them back on their way.\nThe Mandalorian is on Disney+ now.",

            "text": "[Editor’s Note: The following review contains spoilers for “The Mandalorian” Season 2, Episode 8, “Chapter 16 – The Believer.”]\n“Chapter 16 – The Rescue” is essentially the big-budget CGI equivalent of watching a small child smash their collection of action figures into one another. It’s messy, incoherent, and utterly mindless. But hey, at least the kid is having fun.\n“The Mandalorian” Season 2 finale marks the long-awaited showdown between Mando (Pedro Pascal) and Moff Gideon (Giancarlo Esposito) following the latter’s abduction of Grogu earlier in the season. Though the episode delivers on that front, features a team-up between many of the show’s standout characters, and resolves the quest Mando set off on at the beginning of the season, it does so with so many noisy and plodding action scenes — and aggravating unanswered questions — that the end result isn’t particularly cathartic.\nThe episode kicks off with Mando, Boba Fett (Temuera Morrison), Fennec Shand (Ming-Na Wen), and Cara Dune (Gina Carano) intercepting Gideon’s sniveling underling Dr. Pershing (Omid Abtahi), who provides the protagonists with important exposition on Gideon’s spaceship. (There’s zero context on how the heroes tracked down Pershing, but if it spared viewers from another side-quest episode, so be it.) Cut to a dingy cantina where Mando and Boba form an uneasy alliance with Mandalorians Bo-Katan Kryze (Katee Sackhoff) and Koska Reeves (Mercedes Varnado), and the stage is set for an all-out assault on Gideon.\nBetween Mando’s quest to save Grogu and deliver him to a Jedi, Gideon’s ill-described plans for the little green guy, Bo-Katan’s mission to reclaim the Darksaber weapon and her position as Mandalorian leader, and enough filler dialogue and action to justify the presence of Boba, Fennec, and Cara, “Chapter 16” had to juggle a lot of moving parts. Even with its extended 40-minute runtime, “Chapter 16” tries to do too much, too fast, especially when so much of the episode revolves around watching Stormtroopers and Dark Trooper droids getting obliterated in the kinds of action scenes that have been done better in the season’s earlier installments.\nThe raid on Gideon’s ship lasts for around 20 minutes and has about enough interesting shots to justify half of that runtime. Stormtroopers die during run-and-gun encounters in the Imperial corridors that have already served as the backdrop of several other episodes. Stormtroopers die when Bo-Katan and Koska shoot them while flying on their jetpacks. Mando breaks a Stormtrooper’s neck. Cara mows down a handful of Stormtroopers with the “Star Wars” version of an LMG. Much like the show’s prior episodes, the season finale’s action is colorful, visceral, and tailor-made to titillate the senses of franchise fans who have strong attachments to these characters and their gadgets. When “The Mandalorian” is at its best, such as the Dave Filoni and Robert Rodriguez-directed episodes earlier in the season, the action stands out because the antagonists are just outmatched enough to make watching the protagonists prevail seem empowering.\nDisney+/screenshot\nThe problem with “Chapter 16” is the pacing is so frantic, the dialogue so expository, and the bloodbath so ceaseless that sensory overload sets in well before the dust settles. There’s a scene around halfway through the episode where a Dark Trooper repeatedly punches Mando in the face while other Dark Troopers punch their way out of a room they’re being kept in. The music indicates this as menacing, but the scene comes after so much wanton destruction that it seems slapstick to the point of unintentional hilarity. Later, Mando engages Gideon in a climactic duel that commits the cardinal sin of making the Darksaber seem weak: Exposition is offered on how the weapon can’t cut through Beskar armor, but this is the one time the beloved black-bladed lightsaber has been used in actual combat in two seasons of “The Mandalorian” and Mando takes the hits like the weapon is a wet noodle. Lame.\nAnyway, Gideon is defeated and Mando reunites with Grogu. Unfortunately, a legion of Dark Troopers advances on the protagonists and all hope seems lost.\nAnd then Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) appears to save the day.\nLike Ahsoka Tano’s and Boba’s introductory scenes earlier in the season, Luke’s grand entrance is handled with religious devotion. There’s a shot of the Jedi’s X-Wing swooping in, then Grogu perks up, realizing that the Jedi he reached out to earlier in the season has finally arrived. The music swells. A cloaked figure with a green lightsaber and black-gloved right hand carves a path through the Dark Troopers.\nExciting lightsabering and Force powers aside, Luke’s effortless dismantling of the supposedly all-powerful Dark Troopers isn’t really that different from the copy-pasted carnage that permeates the rest of the episode, but it doesn’t matter because it’s Luke Skywalker. The high-profile cameos on “The Mandalorian” have been about as blatant as fan service gets, but even the most cynical “Star Wars” fans won’t be able to resist cracking a smile. Luke’s scenes, be it his combat, his brief conversation with Mando, or R2D2 appearing to make some nostalgic bleep-bloop noises, steal the show. (This is a younger Luke and though the de-aging effects used on Hamill are much better than the grisly CGI in Disney’s “Rogue One: A Star Wars Story,” it’s still off-putting. Thankfully, it doesn’t ruin the moment.)\nDisney\nAfter a brief, amiable conversation with Mando, Luke departs with Grogu and then… That’s it. Roll credits. See you in late 2021 when Season 3 drops, Disney+.\nThe mic drop ending is certain to keep franchise loyalists on the edge of their seats waiting for more “The Mandalorian” content, but the finale’s stellar cameo isn’t enough to rid the feeling that Season 2’s central narrative ended on an unfulfilling note. Mando and Grogu shared a goodbye and Gideon has presumably been detained, but there’s still no clear indication of what Gideon planned to do with Grogu’s blood or how Bo-Katan’s mission to rule Mandalore will be resolved. Mando completed his mission to deliver Grogu mere seconds before the credits rolled, nullifying any opportunity to celebrate his victory, reminisce, or plan for his future. And what exactly happened to Luke and Grogu between the events of “The Mandalorian” and the Sequel Trilogy when Luke’s new Jedi Order was destroyed?\nThere is no doubt that all of these questions and loose ends will be resolved in future seasons of “The Mandalorian” or one of Disney’s myriad other upcoming “Star Wars” titles. Like the company’s Marvel Cinematic Universe films, every plot point that is resolved in “The Mandalorian” leads to two more loose ends that promise to be resolved if viewers keep subscribing to Disney+ for the next chunk of the story. It’s a shame that the Season 2 finale was more interested in mindless slaughter than exploring any of these potentially interesting threads in greater detail.\nGrade: C+\n“The Mandalorian” Season 2 is streaming on Disney+.\nSign Up: Stay on top of the latest breaking film and TV news!
