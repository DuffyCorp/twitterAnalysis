        "text": "When \"The Super Mario Bros. Movie\" opened in theaters earlier this month, the experts were ready to count out the computer-animated film as another disposable video-game byproduct like the colossally awful, 1993 live-action take on the 1985 Nintendo game. Not so fast.\nCritics jeered, but audiences came in droves. Having already cleaned up with more than $700 million worldwide, \"The Super Mario Bros. Movie\" is now the biggest box-office hit of 2023, setting records for the largest global opening ever for an animated film. How far can it go? Do I hear a billion? Easy.\nWhat happened? Parents starved for family entertainment, that's what happened. There's also the fact that \"The Super Mario Bros. Movie\" is way more fun even for non-gamers than skeptics predicted. Repeat business is off the charts. So get over your hesitation and jump aboard.\nDon't expect miracles. Even at 93 minutes, the movie can drift into dull and derivative. Still, I think it's an asset that \"The Super Mario Bros. Movie\" is aimed at 5-year-olds of all ages, meaning the child in all of us. Look elsewhere, maybe \"Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves,\" for winking adult references. It's the dedication to silliness that makes \"Mario\" such an impish delight.\nAs directed by Aaron Horvath and Michael Jelenic, from a script by Matthew Fogel, the film doesn't even try to reinvent the genre. It only wants to capture enough of the joystick energy of the game to cover the sins of merch pedaling and thin plotting and characterization.\nFears about ethnic stereotyping emerged from the voice casting of non-Italian Chris Pratt as Mario. Relax. Pratt uses his own voice to play the mustachioed Italian plumber in overalls. Ditto Charlie Day as his shy brother Luigi. Both put on exaggerated Italian accents in a TV ad for the bros' Brooklyn plumbing business, then revert to normal. Problem solved? Pretty much.\nTrouble starts immediately as Mario and Luigi go underground to fix a manhole leak and are sucked into a warp pipe that sends them into two separate universes. Mario lands in the Mushroom Kingdom, ruled by Princess Peach (Anya Taylor-Joy in fine, frisky form).\nPoor Luigi is zapped into the Dark Lands controlled by the evil King Koopa, Bowser, a kind of demonic turtle with red eyebrows who finds the perfect verbal pairing in wild man Jack Black. Bowser yearns for Princess Peach and will destroy her kingdom if she refuses to marry him.\nMario, who is also hot for Peach, can't have that, plus he needs to rescue Luigi from Bowser and form an alliance with the Kong family of gorillas by showing that he -- even in a cat suit -- can win a fight with the king's son Donkey Kong (Seth Rogen doing a great Seth Rogen).\nGot that? No matter. The plot is just a flimsy excuse to have these characters mix it up one more time on the big screen. Live action can't cut it. The first \"Mario\" movie proved that by staying rigidly earthbound.\nThe real secret behind the unexpected and staggering success of \"The Super Mario Bros. Movie\" is animation, which niftily catches the anarchy of gaming. It creates the illusion that anything is possible. It's also the next best thing to playing the actual game, which continues to thrive and multiply.\nCan the movie spawn its own hive of sequels? Two words: Game on.",

        "text": "Mario the plumber has been one of the most beloved characters in the history of video games ever since he was first seen jumping over barrels and running up girders in Donkey Kong in 1981. But even if you've never played a single video game, there is no reason why a Mario film shouldn't be worth seeing. True, 1993's Super Mario Bros, with Bob Hoskins and John Leguizamo, was a notorious flop, but The Lego Movie was tied to a line of plastic construction sets, and that was wonderful. Wreck-It Ralph demonstrated how clever a cartoon set in a video-game milieu could be. And another recent release Dungeons and Dragons: Honour Among Thieves proved that films adapted from games could be plenty of fun, whether or not you're familiar with the games in question. Unfortunately, The Super Mario Bros Movie is not one of those films.\nMore like this:\n\u2013 The ultimate video game icon\n\u2013 11 of the best films to watch in April\n\u2013 The Cold War battle over Tetris\nThe disappointing part is that the missable new cartoon is directed by Aaron Horvath and Michael Jelenic, the makers of the brilliantly zany Teen Titans Go!, but every 10-minute episode of that series had more ideas in it than the whole of their film. Another disappointing aspect is that the early scenes set in Brooklyn are promising. Mario (Chris Pratt, who, as well as starring in Guardians of The Galaxy and Jurassic World, voiced the hero in The Lego Movie) and his nervous younger brother Luigi (Charlie Day) are established as good-hearted, bushy-moustached young guys who are trying to build their own independent plumbing business. There are some sly nods to the games, and some witty explanations for the characters' more questionable qualities: their white gloves are a marketing gimmick, Mario tells his sceptical family, and their exaggerated Italian accents are put on for a TV advertisement. There's an amusingly chaotic set piece in which a tap-fixing job is sabotaged by an embittered dog. And the computer-animation is impressively advanced, the only snag being that the textured surfaces of every object are almost photo-realistic, which makes the simplified, rounded Mario and Luigi look like walking cuddly toys in comparison.\nThe film doesn't just have quick references to these games, it has long sequences lifted from them\nAnyway, one night the brothers investigate a flood, which is never explained, and find a magical pipe, which is also never explained. The pipe zaps them both to another planet, or possibly another universe. That's never explained, either. Mario is deposited in the fairy-tale Mushroom Kingdom, where cheerful talking fungi are led by a Barbie-like blonde called Princess Peach (Anya Taylor-Joy). But poor Luigi is captured by the monstrous Bowser (Jack Black), who has a name which suggests that he's a dog, and a physique which suggests that he's a dragon, but who is actually the leader of a race of turtles called Koopas. By a remarkable coincidence, the brothers arrive on this surreal planet (or, possibly, in this surreal universe) just after Bowser has just got hold of a glowing star which will enable him to conquer Mushroom Kingdom.\nTo the untrained eye, it looks as if he and his army are so strong that they could have conquered it, anyway, but never mind. The Super Mario Bros Movie has the kind of baffling, nonsensical mythology you might expect when a Japanese game company creates an Italian-American plumber from Brooklyn, and then keeps developing that character's adventures for 40 years. As long as you don't worry about it, and embrace the psychedelic randomness, you can accept it as silly, what's-not-to-like science-fiction. But after a few scenes, this bamboozling plot outline is the least of the film's problems.\nThe trouble starts when Mario is suddenly surrounded by floating bricks, giant gold coins, \"Power Up\" cubes, and burbling electronic sound effects, which only make sense in the context of a video game. It becomes clear at this stage that the directors have given up on making a cartoon which anyone might enjoy, and have concentrated instead on piling on references for the benefit of the games' devoted fans.\nWhat's worse is that the film doesn't just have quick references to these games, it has long sequences lifted from them. Rather than moving along the plot, the directors keep making the characters run around gravity-defying aerial assault courses, or drive racing cars along a rainbow, just because that's what happens in the games. They slow the film to a standstill every time. Mario and Peach are supposed to be rushing to defend her realm from Bowser's invading army, but these pointless sequences remind us that no one is in any hurry to get anywhere. Take into account the lack of logic governing whether it's possible to be injured or killed, and you can see why the film feels so sluggish and padded, even though it's about 80 minutes before the end credits roll. Who knew that the slapstick with a dog in a Brooklyn bathroom would be its dramatic and comedic highlight?\nMatthew Fogel, the screenwriter, has done an efficient job of linking the various references, but the film has an astonishing lack of jokes, twists, memorable lines, exhilarating stunts, touching emotional moments, and anything else that might engage any viewer who isn't playing spot-the-allusion. As slick and corporate as The Super Mario Bros Movie is, it has a first-draft laziness that's rare in big-screen animation. When Mario is learning to be a hero, Bonnie Tyler's Holding Out for a Hero is slapped on the soundtrack. When Mario and Donkey Kong (Seth Rogen) fight in an arena, Kong impersonates Russell Crowe in Gladiator. Does either of those choices seem funny or surprising to you?\nThe Super Mario Bros. Movie\nDirectors: Aaron Horvath, Michael Jelenic\nCast: Chris Pratt, Anya Taylor-Joy, Charlie Day, Jack Black\nRun-time: 1hr 32mins\nRelease date: 5 April in the US and UK\nThe film-makers are obviously so sure that they have a can't-fail franchise on their hands that they haven't even bothered with world-building. For instance, a flashback shows us that Princess Peach is a human who wandered into the Mushroom Kingdom from another planet \u2013 maybe even the same planet as Mario. But this mystery is neither cleared up nor mentioned again, presumably because the producers are saving it for one of the many sequels that they're planning. No doubt their confidence is justified. The Super Mario Bros Movie will probably make a fortune, because it is harmless and colourful enough to be almost adequate as an Easter holiday time-passer for small children. Any adults accompanying those children may wish they were watching the Hoskins and Leguizamo film instead.\n\u2605\u2605\u2606\u2606\u2606\nThe Super Mario Bros.

Movie\u2019 review: plucky plumbers\u2019 new adventure should have stayed a pipe dream\nThe animated children\u2019s film, adapted from the iconic Nintendo video game franchise, was released in cinemas last week.\nReviews have generally been negative, and the film currently holds \u201cRotten\u201d critics\u2019 score of 57 per cent on review aggregator site Rotten Tomatoes.\nHowever, the audience score \u2013 which is voted for by non professional critics \u2013 currently sits at 96 per cent positive, making it \u201cFresh\u201d.\nOn Twitter, Musk commented on the disparity between the critics and audience after an account called @BoredOfElonMusk shared an image of the Rotten Tomatoes scores.\n\u201cContent review systems are broken. Because critics have a problem with Chris Pratt, the \u2018experts\u2019 have deemed the new Mario movie a D- even though audiences clearly love it,\u201d the account tweeted.\n\u201cBoth of these groups are obviously biased, but the disparity here reveals a major problem.\u201d\nIn response, Musk wrote: \u201cWow, the critics are so disconnected from reality!\u201d\nWow, the critics are so disconnected from reality!\n\u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) April 6, 2023\nMusk\u2019s comment sparked a debate on Twitter, with some users arguing that critics should review films based on their intended audience.\n\u201cYa and movies really shouldn\u2019t be rated or reviewed in a vacuum, but rather the audience they were created for,\u201d tweeted one person.\nAnother wrote: \u201c\u2018Critics\u2019 ought to predict what you\u2019ll enjoy. Instead they more focused on telling what they think you *should* enjoy.\u201d\nCountering Musk\u2019s tweet, one person argued: \u201cThis is exactly how these numbers should look given that the movie\u2019s audience is children and most professional critics are adults.\u201d\nIn a two-star review of The Super Mario Bros. Movie, NME wrote: \u201cClearly, adapting the best-selling video game franchise of all-time into an equally ingenious movie is a tall order. It\u2019s faithful enough to tempt existing fans to the cinema, but too perfunctory to be pored over. Is the Mario movie super? To paraphrase one of the title character\u2019s catchphrases, it\u2019s-a mediocre.\u201d",

Movie is based on the hugely popular Nintendo video game/entertainment franchise. Mario (voiced by Chris Pratt) and Princess Peach (Anya Taylor-Joy) team up for a quest that involves elements from several of the games, including Donkey Kong, Mario Kart, Super Mario 3D World, and more. The movie is a bit edgier than the games when it comes to cartoon violence, scares, and bullying. Expect missiles, explosions, a well-landed punch, and a plan to make \"ritual sacrifices.\" While Mario and Peach are brave, they and other characters are often visibly panicked and are in constant peril from villain Bowser, who burns down the walls of a kingdom and issues deadly threats to those in his way. Some kids may be frightened by a scene in which Luigi is chased by zombie skeleton turtles with glowing red eyes that creep out of the ground en masse and eventually capture him. The Mario Bros. also hear a lot of insults and are the targets of bullying behavior by a former employer and get teased by family members (\"idiot,\" \"stupid,\" \"shut up,\" etc.). And, of course, there are those magic mushrooms. But ultimately themes of perseverance, courage, and teamwork are clear.\nCommunity Reviews\nWhat do I think?\nReport this review\nFun Loving Movie Minus any Agenda\nReport this review\nWhat's the Story?\nIn THE SUPER MARIO BROS. MOVIE, Brooklyn plumbers Mario (voiced by Chris Pratt) and his younger brother, Luigi (Charlie Day), fall down a mysterious portal and wind up separated inside a magical world. Mario lands in the Mushroom Kingdom, which is ruled by Princess Peach (Anya Taylor-Joy), who's strategizing how to prevent her land from being conquered by the nefarious Bowser (Jack Black). When Mario realizes that Luigi has likely been taken prisoner by Bowser, he and Peach team up to save his brother and her people.\nIs It Any Good?\nNintendo fans will feel like they grabbed a Super Star while watching this brightly colored magical adventure, which mashes several Mario games up into a full storyline. But for viewers who are less familiar, sitting through The Super Mario Bros. Movie may feel like watching a second grader play a Mario game: It's cute, but you can't help thinking about all the other things you could be doing with your time. Making movies based on video games that have beloved characters and a built-in fan base seems like a natural choice, but not many do it well (exceptions include Sonic the Hedgehog and Detective Pikachu), and The Super Mario Bros. Movie doesn't depart from that norm.\nWhile it is fun to see the brothers in their \"real life\" environment in Brooklyn -- working as plumbers and living at home with their big Italian family -- as well as how the filmmakers incorporate elements of the games, the film isn't funny or creative enough to satisfy most teens or adults. Moreover, the child-friendly animation style is a tad misleading, as directors Aaron Horvath and Michael Jelenic up the scare factor, making Bowser and his minions more terrifying than they need to be. There's plenty of excitement, nonstop action, and colorful images, but this project as a whole doesn't exactly level up.\nTalk to Your Kids About ...\nFamilies can talk about how the cartoon action in The Super Mario Bros.

        "text": "Now streaming on:\nI can vividly remember playing the first Nintendo version of \u201cSuper Mario Bros.\u201d when I was just a boy in the \u201880s. It was at a friend\u2019s house, my first buddy to get an NES, and I went home and had a dream about the game. The goofy, jumping plumber has been a part of my entertainment life ever since. I\u2019ve passed my love for the franchise down to my boys, who have all played the stunning \u201cSuper Mario Odyssey\u201d to completion more than once. Mario has come a long way since the notoriously awful 1993 version of his adventure starring Bob Hoskins and John Leguizamo, but the new \u201cThe Super Mario Bros. Movie\u201d doesn\u2019t reflect the franchise's creativity in the slightest. The latest animated blockbuster from Illumination is their most soulless to date, a film that feels like ChatGPT produced it after data and imagery from the games were fed into a computer. It is \u201cThe Chris Farley Show\u201d of family entertainment, mistaking making references to something that was \u201cawesome\u201d for actually making a movie. And it is one of the most drenched-in-desperation animated films I\u2019ve ever seen. \u201cRemember this?!? Remember how much you liked it?!? Please like it again!\u201d I so desperately wanted to see something that sparked the imagination of the kid in me, like that first game, or spoke to the fun I\u2019ve had playing installments across multiple Nintendo platforms. Instead, I got a movie that's as hollow as a trailer, something that willfully avoids anything creative or ambitious. Mario and Luigi deserve so much better.\n\u201cThe Super Mario Bros. Movie\u201d opens in Brooklyn with the plumbers Mario (Chris Pratt) and his brother Luigi (Charlie Day) trying to get their new business off the ground. Some Nintendo easter eggs in the background of these initial scenes should produce a small smile from people of my generation, and there's a bit of inspiration structurally, like a clever early shot in which Mario and Luigi race through the city in a side-scrolling manner that mimics the earlier games. There\u2019s also a nod to The Odyssey on a bookshelf in Mario\u2019s room, implying that we\u2019re about to watch a hero\u2019s journey and a reference to the incredible Switch game. What follows doesn\u2019t live up to either inspiration.\nIn a way that makes little sense, Mario and Luigi find a massive chamber of pipes under Brooklyn, get sucked into one, and end up in the Mushroom Kingdom, which is being threatened by the villainous Bowser (Jack Black). The notorious bad guy has found the Super Star he needs to make his final assault on Princess Peach (Anya Taylor-Joy) and the residents of her kingdom, including Toad (Keegan-Michael Key). Bowser doesn\u2019t just want power; he wants to make the Princess his bride, singing some truly uninspired songs about his love for her. How on Earth a film like this gets a rock talent like half of Tenacious D and doesn\u2019t let him unleash a few clever Bowser tunes is one of this film\u2019s many mysteries.\nAlthough Luigi lands in the pipeline that drops him immediately in the dark lands and makes him Bowser's prisoner\u2014a dumb decision that sidelines him for an hour\u2014Mario meets Princess Peach, who introduces him to power-ups. And so all the question-mark cubes get a chance to shine as Mario grows, shrinks, and even turns into a raccoon. They eventually recruit Donkey Kong (Seth Rogen), race down Rainbow Road, and save the day. That\u2019s not a spoiler if you\u2019ve ever seen a movie.\nFans of this movie will shout from the rooftops that the scripting for something called \u201cThe Super Mario Bros. Movie\u201d doesn\u2019t need to be a strength. And, to be fair, there are a few strong settings in terms of design. I enjoyed the choices made by the team in the structure of Donkey Kong Country, and the Rainbow Road \u201cSuper Mario Kart\u201d sequence is well-directed. But I would ask why fans of a franchise that has inspired so much love for generations must be satisfied with the absolute minimum regarding storytelling.\nThere are so few actual decisions made in the construction of this film. It\u2019s just a collection of visual and character references cobbled together to form a 92-minute movie. Take a risk. Just do something. Anything. It got me thinking about the fun spin-offs that could exist, like a \u201cMad Max: Fury Road\u201d version of the \u201cMario Kart\u201d sequence that gets energy out of non-stop motion. Or a version that unpacks like \u201cThe LEGO Movie\u201d that's more sharply aware of its references and world-building\u2014something that even incorporates the player like that movie does in the end. I swear that almost everyone who has played a game like \u201cOdyssey\u201d could come up with something more inventive. Heck, almost any ten minutes of that game is more creative.\nIt doesn\u2019t help that the voice work is uniformly mediocre too. Chris Pratt can be charismatic with the right material, but it sounds like he pounded this out in three hours in a voice studio. Charlie Day has such an expressive voice, but the movie barely uses him. Seth Rogen is always a welcome presence, and he at least seems to be having some fun. I wish I was too.\nWith the nostalgia craze merging with the power of Nintendo and Illumination, \u201cThe Super Mario Bros. Movie\u201d feels too big to fail. That means we\u2019ll get a sequel, and I expect another cycle of the debate of \u201ccritics vs. fans.\u201d I am both. And I want a world where the people who made films for a fan base as devoted as this one don\u2019t take that fandom for granted. This is far from over. I suspect we will get a ton of films from the NES universe, including \u201cDonkey Kong Country\u201d and \u201cThe Legend of Zelda\u201d (and let\u2019s not forget \u201cKid Icarus\u201d). But we need creators who don\u2019t just see these games as products to be referenced but as foundations on which new ideas can be built. That \u201880s kid who dreamed of Mario deserves it.\nIn theaters today.\n92 minutes\nChris Pratt as Mario (voice)\nAnya Taylor-Joy as Princess Peach (voice)\nCharlie Day as Luigi (voice)\nJack Black as Bowser (voice)\nKeegan Michael Key as Toad (voice)\nSeth Rogen as Donkey Kong (voice)\nFred Armisen as Cranky Kong (voice)\nKevin Michael Richardson as Kamek (voice)\nSebastian Maniscalco as Spike (voice)\nCharles Martinet as Giuseppe (voice)\nKhary Payton as Penguin King (voice)\nEric Bauza as General Toad (voice)",

Movie\u2019 Review: This Ain\u2019t No Game\nA famed video game character side-scrolls once again to the big screen in this bland, witless and flagrantly pandering animated comedy.\n- The Super Mario Bros. Movie\n- Directed by Aaron Horvath, Michael Jelenic\n- Animation, Adventure, Comedy, Family, Fantasy, Romance, Sci-Fi\n- PG\n- 1h 32m\nOne thing every great Mario game has in common, from 2D classics like Super Mario World to seminal 3D installments like Super Mario 64 or the recent Nintendo Switch masterpiece Super Mario Odyssey, is a certain effortless charisma. No convoluted backstory, no sardonic attitude, no pretension whatsoever: just easy, straightforward video game fun, elevated by splashy visuals, tight controls and an attention to detail that borders on perfectionism.\nIllumination and Universal\u2019s \u201cThe Super Mario Bros. Movie,\u201d the second attempt at a big-screen adaptation of the game franchise after the woefully unsuccessful \u201cSuper Mario Bros.\u201d (1993), gets many things about Mario right, often painstakingly so. The Mushroom Kingdom, the magical land in which the film is largely set, looks pretty much exactly like the Mushroom Kingdom of the games. Fireflowers, super stars and question mark boxes all look, sound and function like they\u2019re supposed to, and when the notoriously vexing blue shell makes a fan-baiting appearance, it spins, crashes and explodes in a way precisely faithful to the source material. Even Mario (a grating, unctuous Chris Pratt), who doesn\u2019t sound like the Mario of the games, still manages to invoke trademark catchphrases like \u201cit\u2019s a-me\u201d and \u201clet\u2019s a-go.\u201d\nBut while the details are meticulous, the attitude is all wrong, trading the simple, unaffected charm that has served the character so well since his introduction in 1981 for a snarky and fatuous air that leans hard on winking humor and bland, hackneyed irony. This is Mario in the Marvel mold: every line a punchline, every gag an arcane meta reference for the nerds who can\u2019t get enough of that sort of thing. Served some spaghetti with mushrooms, Mario winces and says he hates mushrooms. Because in the game he\u2019s always eating mushrooms, you see. Sound like fun yet?\nIn this rendition, directed by Aaron Horvath and Michael Jelenic, Mario and his cowardly younger brother, Luigi (Charlie Day), are upstart plumbers from Brooklyn who, for reasons that feel both unnecessarily complicated and curiously underexplained, are zapped into the fantastical world of Princess Peach (Anya Taylor-Joy), Toad (Keegan-Michael Key) and the nefarious Bowser (Jack Black). Much of what transpires has some basis in the original games, in a way that often feels oppressively pandering, and the movie\u2019s commitment to fan service frequently results in baffling decisions in the context of the film. When Mario recruits Donkey Kong (Seth Rogen) to take on Bowser\u2019s army, they elect to travel via go-kart. Are go-karts inherently interesting or compelling? No. Is there any logical reason why they would use go-karts? No. But there are go-karts in the video game Mario Kart, so in karts they go.\nEvery level of the original Super Mario Bros. ends with an apology that has become one of the game\u2019s most enduring catchphrases: \u201cOur princess is in another castle.\u201d In \u201cThe Super Mario Bros. Movie,\u201d it\u2019s deployed as a flat, mirthless inside joke \u2014 another pat reference, unfunny and predictable, charged with a yawning desperation to please. It doesn\u2019t seem right that the spirit of such a pure and exuberant character should be reduced to something so flippant and basically cynical. And though every conceivable effort has been taken to make this \u201cMario\u201d as Mario-like as possible, the attitude is antithetical to exactly what the franchise so wholesomely represents.\nThe Super Mario Bros. Movie\nRated PG. Running time: 1 hour 32 minutes. In theaters.",

        "text": "It took nearly four decades, one spectacular live-action misfire, and dozens of other failed video game adaptations to learn from, but none of it went to waste: Illumination and Nintendo\u2019s Super Mario Bros. Movie finally gives the most iconic character in gaming the onscreen adventure he\u2019s always deserved. Benefitting immensely from the endless creativity of the innumerable game developers, artists, and musicians who\u2019ve made the Mario franchise a pop culture juggernaut, The Super Mario Bros. Movie rockets along with the momentum of a Bullet Bill exploding out of a cannon. The Mushroom Kingdom is realized with incredible detail and reverence, and not even a Paper Mario-thin plot can keep the magic of the games from being lost along the way.\nThe Super Mario Bros. Movie\u2019s setup is dead simple: while on a plumbing job underneath Brooklyn, brothers Mario (Chris Pratt) and Luigi (Charlie Day) are sucked into the Mushroom Kingdom through a warp pipe and become embroiled in King Bowser\u2019s (Jack Black) plans to steal the Super Star, which would give him the power to take over the Toad-filled domain of Princess Peach (Anya Taylor-Joy). Mario\u2019s Cheep-Cheep-out-of-water journey hits all the predictable beats of the \u201cwarrior from another world\u201d narrative, but decades of Mario games ensure co-directors Aaron Horvath and Michael Jelenic (Teen Titans Go!) have an infinite well of wild scenarios and iconography to pull from to stage inventive action moments, especially once Mario\u2019s gotten a handle of how to properly fly with a Tanooki suit.\nThe Super Mario Bros. Movie almost always has an inventive in-world solution to whatever problem pops up that relies on something easily recognizable from the games, but never withholds explanation of how that thing works (even if the why goes rightfully ignored.) Whether it\u2019s recreating the path of World 1-1 as Mario and Luigi parkour their way through Brooklyn or the pre-emptive giggle fans will get seeing Mario ingest a blue mushroom instead of a red one during a fight, The Super Mario Bros. Movie manages a great balance of accessibility for general audiences and inside jokes for those of us who\u2019ve dipped in and out of the series over the years.\nThe Super Mario Bros. Movie\u2019s heavy use of references isn\u2019t a good thing in and of itself, but their inclusion feels justified because they are used in ways that feel relevant and organic to the world. At worst, sequences like the Rainbow Road race can feel a bit tacked on when they don\u2019t fully make the case for being there with any kind of logical reason (being able to sell movie-branded Mario Kart toys doesn\u2019t count), but then logic is not a currency anyone\u2019s expecting The Super Mario Bros. Movie to trade in anyway. The movie trusts its audience isn\u2019t going to care much about why platforms float, or why there are blocks with question marks all over the place full of power-ups that turn people into cats and flamethrowers. Once you\u2019ve already bought in to things like that, giving 10 minutes of the movie up to staging a big-budget Mario Kart race so that a trek from A to B feels a little more lively is an easier pill to swallow.\n\u201c\nThe Super Mario Bros. Movie\u2019s visual vibrance sets a very high bar for the other animated video game adaptations which will surely follow, be that from Nintendo or another studio. Bowser\u2019s fire-versus-ice siege of the Penguin Kingdom, the expansive fungi vistas of the Mushroom Kingdom, and the lush greenery of the Kongs\u2019 Jungle Kingdom are all super-saturated dreamscapes that coalesce into a bustling world begging to be explored further. Brian Tyler\u2019s bombastic score takes care of the musical side of this equation, perfectly expressing the grandeur and whimsy of the games\u2019 tracks at every turn and mining Koji Kondo\u2019s original orchestrations to great effect. The Mario series has some of the most recognizable music cues in gaming history, and Tyler deploys many of them throughout the action just where you hope they\u2019d drop.\nThe movie\u2019s mostly excellent use of its source material does contrast with some ill-advised blockbuster animation tropes which can occasionally be grating. Kind of like someone stealing a star from you in Mario Party, the fantastic score makes the pop tracks that are shoehorned in feel lazy by comparison. A little \u201cNo Sleep \u2018Til Brooklyn\u201d as Mario and Luigi parkour their way through the borough never hurt anyone, but by the time Mario and Peach are being karted around the Jungle Kingdom to A-Ha\u2019s \u201cTake On Me,\u201d you may find the needle drops being a little too much of a snap back to reality. That goes double for the writers being unable to resist the urge to have Donkey Kong himself saying \u201cit\u2019s on like Donkey Kong.\u201d Moments like this - as well as the frequent use of slo-mo to highlight jokes - are a bit too cute, and hint at how easily The Super Mario Bros. Movie could\u2019ve slipped into \u201cgeneric animated movie\u201d territory had it given way to more of these low-hanging stabs at making sure Uncle Jack has his \u201cI understood that reference!\u201d moment, too.\nThe interminable Discourse surrounding the voice acting in The Super Mario Bros. Movie, as expected, feels totally out of touch with what the cast actually ended up delivering: enthusiastic performances that bring life to the characters, with no real weak link among them. Chris Pratt and Charlie Day\u2019s Mario Bros. are certainly not going to be taking home any commendations from the good people of Brooklyn on their New York accents, but each handily embody their character\u2019s heroism and bravery (hard won though that may be for Luigi). There\u2019s definitely been a flattening of the more cartoonish qualities to the lead characters\u2019 in-game voices - something the movie addresses immediately - but the choice to ground conversations in more a more natural delivery balances well with the fantastical trappings of the Mushroom Kingdom. More than that, it still leaves room for supporting characters like Toad (Keegan-Michael Key), Kamek (Kevin Michael Richardson), and Cranky Kong (Fred Armisen) to be a little kookier and give the ensemble more range. And even though it\u2019s a one-joke character with no impact on the plot, Lumalee\u2019s (Juliet Jelenic, co-director Michael\u2019s daughter) gleeful nihilism lands big laughs every time thanks mostly to the young voice actor\u2019s unerring excitement, which bubbles behind every pitch black observation she makes while locked up with Luigi.\nJack Black\u2019s Bowser feels like the standout vocal performance as the actor\u2019s trademark bombast fits well with the Koopa King\u2019s outsized sense of self. Bowser\u2019s thirst for power isn\u2019t explored in any serious way: he wants to take over the Mushroom Kingdom because he\u2019s a bad guy and that\u2019s what bad guys do - apparently he missed the point of that group session in Wreck-it Ralph. But Black\u2019s Bowser is frightening, impetuous, and desperate for attention at times, and those frequent mood shifts lend his scenes unpredictability. Jables\u2019 Bowser even performs a ballad in Peach\u2019s honor which feels like a safe-for-work Tenacious D b-side, a descriptor I can\u2019t imagine will upset any fans of Black\u2019s musical chops.\nThe Super Mario Bros. Movie is constantly and joyfully entertaining, and that\u2019s crucial because it lacks any meaningful thematic throughline outside of \u201cwe can do anything when we work together!\u201d That lesson feels like an obligated afterthought considering Mario and Luigi spend the majority of this movie separated - not because of any emotional fracture between them early on, but by pure happenstance (warp pipes are crazy!) The brothers mostly agree on everything, and both are quick to enlist the help of allies when the time comes, so the little effort that went into that aspect of the story goes very much amiss. This feels especially frustrating considering the pair of brief flashbacks which give us insights into the characters\u2019 childhoods. Both of these short scenes manage a comparatively touching tone, and hint at better avenues the story could\u2019ve explored to make Mario, Luigi, and Peach feel more fully formed.",

        "text": "The last time Mario \u2014 the lovably high-voiced moustachioed Italian plumber, and the most iconic name in video games \u2014 starred in a film, it bombed so badly that Nintendo waited 30 years before giving their mascot another crack at the big screen. Now something of an oddball cult classic, the 1993 Bob Hoskins-starring live-action version was both a strangely realistic take on the game (Mario is fixing broken dishwashers and worrying about paying rent) and bafflingly outlandish (it is partly set in a dino-steampunk parallel dimension), bearing only tangential resemblance to the source material. This lively new animated version, on the other hand, is deeply faithful \u2014 to a fault.\nThis is exactly what you might expect from a Super Mario Bros. movie. It\u2019s like a greatest hits parade of the franchise: there\u2019s the rainbow road from Mario Kart, the spooky house from Luigi\u2019s Mansion, the New Donk City level from Super Mario Odyssey, the moons from Super Mario Galaxy, and more obscure Easter Eggs besides (listen out for the GameCube startup sound). The story borrows mechanics and terminology from the game, too: there are power-ups, blue shells and a side-scrolling mission. Brian Tyler\u2019s score never misses an opportunity to borrow some of Koji Kondo\u2019s gloriously recognisable musical motifs, either.\nIt\u2019s-a-gonna win many box-office gold coins, no doubt. But the Bob Hoskins version is far more imaginative.\nIt\u2019s all laser-designed to tickle the nostalgia adenoids of Nintendo nerds. But it ultimately never feels more than just a very high-definition, feature-length video game cutscene \u2013 the bit you sit through while waiting to play the actual game. While a training montage sequence hints at the repetitive trial-and-error of the original NES title, it seems to misunderstand that the real joy of these games was, first and foremost, the gorgeously designed, addictively satisfying gameplay.\nWithout that here, we\u2019re left only with the characters, which are as thin as an 8-bit image file, and, with the possible exception of Jack Black (who brings a Tenacious D energy to his Bowser), entirely miscast. There\u2019s an admirable attempt to explain this away, but in a world where everyone already knows exactly what Mario sounds like \u2014 the movie itself even reminds us, in a cameo from long-standing Mario voice actor Charles Martinet \u2014 Chris Pratt\u2019s Mario simply doesn\u2019t sound like Mario. (The Mario family as a whole, incidentally, are the most egregious Italian stereotypes to be seen this side of a Dolmio advert; how many \u201cMamma Mia!\u201ds does it take to constitute a hate crime?)\nThis comes from Illumination, a studio that never quite earned the critical cred of rivals like Pixar or Sony, but through their Minions and Sing franchises have certainly figured out how to make millions of family-friendly dollars. You feel that half-term hymn sheet being sung from in the endless peril, the bright colours, the largely unfunny gags, the empty sentiment (\u201cNothing can hurt us as long as we\u2019re together!\u201d). The studio brings experience and talent; the standard of animation, crisply rendered and richly art-directed, is undeniably high. It\u2019s-a-gonna win many box-office gold coins, no doubt. But the Bob Hoskins version is far more imaginative.",

        "text": "Back in 2005, when shrugs were on trend and the Rock was still willing to play a villain, Universal released an adaptation of the first-person shooter Doom that had been in the works for a decade. It promptly bombed at the box office, mostly because it was, like so many other movies based on video games, terrible. The game franchise is famously heavy on carnage and light on narrative, but the movie had a cumbersome plot involving an ancient Martian civilization and genetic experimentation. And yet, during its climax, Doom did something magnificent. It shifted to the point of view of its hero, played by the un-embarrassable Karl Urban, as his character glided through a labyrinth of industrial hallways blasting infected attackers with a weapon that he held up in the frame, exactly like in the game. The audience howled with laughter, on account of it looking goofy as hell, but that dumb scene in that dumb movie got at why the gap between the two mediums can feel unbridgeable \u2014 because the core experiential aspect of one, gameplay, isn\u2019t something that can readily be replicated in the other. It\u2019s tough to adapt something while leaving its essence behind.\nSay what you will about Doom \u2014 which may be nothing, it isn\u2019t exactly an underappreciated classic \u2014 but at least it made a bold choice. The Super Mario Bros. Movie, an almost impressively generic kiddie movie re-skinned with characters and concepts from one of the most famous video game franchises in the world, might as well have been assembled by a focus group. A movie like this doesn\u2019t need to have personality when it\u2019s familiar, filled with bright colors and frenetic action, and, most importantly, the only children\u2019s fare to arrive in theaters in weeks. The Super Mario Bros. Movie only shows the slightest spark of life when it tries to evoke what it\u2019s like to actually play one of the titles it\u2019s inspired by (something that looks a lot less jarring in animation than it does in live action). Not because those few moments are fan service, but because that\u2019s when the movie has a sense of purpose. There\u2019s some cute side-scrolling action in which Mario (Chris Pratt) and his brother Luigi (Charlie Day) navigate a construction site and tag out at the flagpole next to a conveniently castle-themed fast food restaurant on the other side. There are two kart racing sequences, one consisting of a chaotic dash along the wooden tracks running through a jungle and the other a junior Fury Road skirmish high above the ocean on multicolored beams of light that loop vertiginously through the sky.\nThen there\u2019s the buoyant scene where Mario, having gone through various pratfall-laden lessons in using power-ups, finally bounds and flies his way through the Mushroom Kingdom landscape to save the day. Of course, Mario has to save the day, because The Super Mario Bros. Movie has 92 minutes to fill and these gameplay bits only take up a fraction of that. A movie needs to be about something, I guess, or at least it can\u2019t be an hour and a half of Mario and company zipping across Rainbow Road with various minions in pursuit. But this particular movie does such a desultory job of assembling all its iconography into something resembling a story that it\u2019s borderline insulting. Mario, who\u2019s introduced living at home and struggling to get the nascent plumbing business he started with Luigi off the ground, is an underdog because\u2026 I don\u2019t know, his dad isn\u2019t supportive enough or he\u2019s short or something. Luigi is hastily designated a coward, though he has no qualms about throwing everything into a local commercial in which the siblings are accented superheroes.\nWhen the brothers get separated and sucked through a mysterious pipe into a magical kingdom filled with mushroom, turtles, and whatever Shy Guys are, Mario meets Princess Peach (Anya Taylor-Joy), a winsome blonde whose main quality is being so good at everything that it\u2019s never clear why she needs to train this stubby newcomer who comes crashing into her life, insisting he needs to rescue his missing brother. Luigi, meanwhile, ends up in the clutches of the lovesick Koopa king Bowser, who\u2019s embarked on a campaign of invasion and destruction in a misguided attempt to woo Peach. Jack Black, who voices the burly villain, generates a few laughs through sheer force of will with a musical interlude, though even that bit gets stretched thin. Keegan-Michael Key voices the fast-talking Toad, and Seth Rogen is Donkey Kong, though the names in the credits that really matter are directors Aaron Horvath and Michael Jelenic, who made the Teen Titans Go! series and its own subsequent big screen spinoff, but who show not a trace of that subversive wit here. It\u2019s all dispiritingly rote, aside from bursts of weird vitality whenever the film veers into action out of the games. The act of adaptation is not the problem here. It\u2019s that the only movie everyone involved came up with is a bad one.\nMore Movie Reviews\n- There Are Four Movies in Guy Ritchie\u2019s The Covenant, and Two of Them Are Good\n- Why Are We Doing This to the Evil Dead Movies?\n- Quasi Proves That Broken Lizard Will Never Grow Up, Thank God",

Read our review.\nVideo game adaptations have had a rough time on the big screen. While recent small screen adaptations have fared better, films are still trying to find a way to capture the thrill of a video game. The newest attempt comes from Illumination, the studio behind the Despicable Me films and tries to build a story around the characters that mostly jump between blocks. Yes, we\u2019re talking about the Super Mario Bros!\nMario (voiced by Chris Pratt) and Luigi (voiced by Charlie Day of It\u2019s Always Sunny in Philadelphia fame) are two Italian-American brothers who have just started a plumbing company. Their very first advert has gone on TV, but their first job is somewhat of a disaster as they piss off the client\u2019s dog and leave a big mess behind.\nWhen all of Brooklyn starts flooding, the brothers see it as an opportunity to redeem themselves, but instead of fixing the leak, they get sucked into a magical world. Mario ends up in Mushroom Kingdom while Luigi finds himself in the Dark Lands, ruled over by the villainous Bowser (Jack Black). Mario and Mushroom Kingdom\u2019s kind ruler Princess Peach (Anya Taylor-Joy) team up to save Luigi and stop Bowser from rising to power.\nThere\u2019s no easy way to say this \u2013 it\u2019s also simple to put. The Super Marios Bros. Movie simply isn\u2019t funny. On paper, it has everything going for it. A star-studded but incredibly capable voice cast, a colourful, quirky world to recreate with the help of cutting-edge CGI and pretty fun characters. Yet none of it works.\nPratt, who did wonderful work in The Lego Movie and its sequel, proves to be playing it safe as the voice of Mario. Much was written about the decision to cast him and people were driven into a frenzy on the Internet over speculation about how bad his Italian accent would be in the film. Turns out, Pratt just sounds a tiny bit congested and nasal rather than Italian, presumably to avoid any criticism over an accent.\nTaylor-Joy turns out to be the film\u2019s biggest asset. Her voice performance is the only one that has any life to it. Jack Black is criminally wasted as Bowser whose motives are never properly fleshed out. There are hints here of better characterisation, such as Bowser\u2019s insecurities but they go largely unexplored.\nAt barely 90 minutes, The Super Mario Bros. Movie speeds through its paper-thin plot. The movie is all plot, but has no compelling themes. In the end, as the credits start finally rolling, it\u2019s hard to see how any of the characters have changed. Luigi spends much of the film\u2019s runtime captured and Bowser is rarely seen in action. The Super Mario Bros. Movie is also visually so flat it might as well be a pancake with some sprinkles.\nThe most dynamic scene in the film is a short training course that Princess Peach has put together. The Super Mario Bros. Movie joins Tetris as a film currently in cinemas with a great sequence set to Bonnie Tyler\u2019s \u2018Holding Out For A Hero\u2019. A set-piece on the iconic Rainbow Road lacks visual interest and most of the action is devoid of any stakes. There is no palpable sense of danger or threat in the film.\nThe Super Mario Bros. Movie is big studio filmmaking at its worst. It\u2019s a kid\u2019s film that tries to pack in as many Easter Eggs as it can, but forgets to inject any wit or fun into its plot. Animation has always been at the forefront of creativity and artists keep finding new ways to revolutionise the art form. The Super Mario Bros. Movie is a true disappointment with its lack of vision.\nThe Super Mario Bros. Movie is in cinemas now.",

        "text": "Strap your tool belt on, kid. We\u2019re going in.\nIf there was ever a time for Nintendo to expand beyond games and enter the film industry, it\u2019s right now. With the smashing success of the Nintendo Switch and a continuous stream of titles that easily eclipse the ten million mark in sales, this is arguably the most popular the company has been in its 100+ year history.\nAnd that popularity can only grow as the millennials who have been with the brand since the early days of little gray boxes are starting to have families of their own, introducing their kids to the plumbers, the princesses, and the piranha plants that have defined their lives. This is a prime time for Nintendo to get out there with a product that\u2019ll appeal to the original generation of Nintendo fans and those who will carry the torch in the future, and releasing a bright and beautiful animated film is a perfect way to do that.\nI just wish it would have picked a better company than Illumination to do it with.\nThe Super Mario Bros. Movie\nDirected by Aaron Horvath and Michael Jelenic\nWritten by Matthew Fogel\nProduced by Universal Pictures, Illumination, Nintendo\nReleased: April 5, 2023\nFor all the bluster and brouhaha that we had to endure in the months following the revelation that Chris Pratt would voice Mario, that should have been what people focused on. Despite its astounding success at the box office, Illumination doesn\u2019t really make good films. Its first picture, Despicable Me, is the only movie from the company with a Rotten Tomatoes score over 80% and a Metacritic score over 70. I know The Super Mario Bros. Movie has sparked yet another tired debate about whether or not reviewers matter anymore, but let\u2019s not pretend this company isn\u2019t out there just coasting on the popularity of its Minions. Illumination isn\u2019t a studio that\u2019s going to take chances or attempt to subvert expectations. It has a dog-eared playbook it sticks to with every one of its films, The Super Mario Bros. Movie included.\nThat doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s no love for the property here. The animation team did an incredible job in bringing every inch of the Mushroom Kingdom and beyond to the big screen. The art direction may be overly clean and without a unique personality, but it looks good enough. And great attention was paid to implementing many different elements from the games into the world, telling the audience the filmmakers have more than just cursory knowledge and appreciation of the series they\u2019re adapting.\nThe same can be said of the film\u2019s music. Composer Brian Tyler did a fantastic job seamlessly incorporating so many Koji Kondo works into his original score. It\u2019s arguably the best part of the film, which is why it\u2019s so disappointing several sequences were injected with predictable pop songs rather than letting Tyler work his magic. And when I say predictable pop songs, I mean predictable. Nobody should be using \u201cHolding Out for a Hero\u201d after Jennifer Saunders\u2019s mic drop in Shrek 2, \u201cBattle Without Honor or Humanity\u201d has been done to death, and going with a-ha\u2019s \u201cTake On Me\u201d for a brief karting sequence was enough to pull me right out of the film. Surprisingly, it was the voice acting that was able to pull me back in.\nIt\u2019s clear Jack Black is reveling in his role as Bowser, but he\u2019s not the only one going all out with his performance. Keegan-Michael Key, who plays the central Toad of the film, is outstanding, as are Kevin Michael Richardson (Kamek) and Fred Armisen (Cranky Kong), who seems to be channeling about six of his different SNL characters for the role. Despite the endless arguments and social media posts, Chris Pratt (Mario) is okay with a Brooklyn-adjacent accent layered on top of his regular voice. Charlie Day (Luigi) takes the same approach, and the two do come off sounding like brothers. At the opposite end of the spectrum, Anna-Taylor Joy (Princess Peach) sounds like Anna-Taylor Joy, while Seth Rogen (Donkey Kong) decided to attempt a cocky teenage version of himself, complete with \u201cthe Seth Rogen laugh.\u201d\nThe voice acting gets the job done, even if the story they\u2019re telling doesn\u2019t. The Super Mario Bros. Movie is hurriedly paced following its opening sequence in Brooklyn, allowing no time for original ideas or character development. Mario comes into this movie fully formed, already a tenacious go-getter who can handle himself well on a platform stage. Princess Peach also doesn\u2019t stray far from when we first meet her. If I were being generous with the term, I\u2019d argue the only character here that does exhibit some growth is Luigi. But because he\u2019s sidelined for most of the film, his big moment doesn\u2019t have the impact it should.\nIt\u2019s surprising how many moments of this movie did not land with the audience at my screening. While a few points elicited laughter from the entire crowd, this reviewer included, many of its more obvious jokes failed to generate any reaction at all. Nearly all of its action sequences fell similarly flat. The only thing in this film that received any type of sustained response was the Mario Kart sequence. Once the first kart popped up on the screen, every kid around me started chirping \u201cMario Kart 8\u201d like they were the seagulls from Finding Nemo.\nBeyond that scene, I didn\u2019t really get the sense any of the kids in the theater were engaging with the film. It could be that I couldn\u2019t hear them over the child next to me who would NOT SHUT UP, or it could be they just weren\u2019t connecting with a movie that seems to be trying to speedrun itself.\nAt just 92 minutes, The Super Mario Bros. Movie doesn\u2019t have a lot of time to work with. And the filmmakers did themselves no favors by trying to pack in as much as they could into such a brief runtime. From Mario Kart to Smash Bros. to a Bowser ballad the filmmakers probably should have just let Jack Black write himself, there isn\u2019t one moment of respite throughout this film. Even when characters find themselves in peril, it\u2019s resolved so quickly I wonder why that sequence was included at all, outside of using it as an opportunity to pop in a few more references from the games.\nTo be clear, I\u2019m not anti-reference. I don\u2019t necessarily have an issue with the filmmakers including details that connect this movie to the games. In fact, I enjoyed quite a few of them, particularly how they weren\u2019t afraid of using elements from the more recent titles in the series (Cat Suit, Ice Flower) rather than just sticking to the classics. However, many of the references here are so inconsequential that they were clearly included, Chekov\u2019s gun be damned, with the expectation they\u2019ll find their way into 50 different YouTube videos about \u201cThings You Missed in The Super Mario Bros. Movie.\u201d The backgrounds of the early scenes in Brooklyn are littered with early Nintendo references, the type designed to turn the adults in the audience into the Pointing Rick Dalton meme.\nAgain, the references here would be fine if they were in a movie attempting to tell an interesting story. But Illumination films don\u2019t tell interesting stories. Maybe they will in the future with Mike White (School of Rock, The White Lotus) on tap to pen the next two films from the studio. For now, they\u2019re settling with an experience designed to shuffle audiences from set piece to set piece as quickly as possible, never once asking you to think about what it is you\u2019re seeing on the screen.\nThe end result is The Super Mario Bros. Movie is a rather torpid piece of entertainment. I\u2019ve seen many people online trying to deflect criticism of this film by stating it\u2019s a kid\u2019s movie, but that\u2019s a rather lousy line of defense. Just because something is made for kids doesn\u2019t mean it has to be superficial. Children are far more capable and cognizant than adults are willing to give them credit for, and we should be offering them more than literal eye candy, something beautiful to look at that provides zero sustenance.\nOr, just make a Mario Kart movie because that seemed to be the only thing the kids at my screening actually cared about.",

        "text": "Between The Super Mario Bros. Movie and Dungeons and Dragons: Honor Among Thieves, Hollywood has been on a hot streak of redeeming itself from its previous terrible attempts at cinematic game adaptations. Unfortunately, the failure of the 1993 Super Mario Bros. film prevented Nintendo from making any more movies with their IP until now. Illumination, the animation studio behind Despicable Me and Sing, gives us a new adventure that turns out to be a lot of fun, capturing (most of) the heart of the video games we grew up playing.\nThe film opens with the evil Bowser (Jack Black) taking control of the Dark Lands. The humor works well while establishing Bowser as a force to be reckoned with. We are then introduced to Mario (Chris Pratt) and Luigi (Charlie Day), two Italian-American plumbers in Brooklyn. After they try unsuccessfully to fix a leak, they find themselves sent to another world where Bowser imprisons Luigi, and Mario must team up with Princess Peach (Anya Taylor-Joy) and Toad (Keegan-Michael Key) to save him. This adventure has a ton of entertainment value, offering something for audiences young and old.\nChildren will love this movie for its humor, bright colors, and sense of adventure. Adults will love this movie because they grew up playing the Super Mario Bros. video games, and the film is filled to the brim with easter eggs. Lovers of the games will be happy to see scenes that are taken directly from the source material. This movie sometimes feels more like a series of references to the games, strung together by a thin story designed for nostalgia. While that is the film\u2019s greatest strength, it is also its greatest weakness.\nThe Super Mario Bros. Movie will make you mindlessly happy, but the pacing is too fast. The film always feels like it\u2019s sprinting from plot point to plot point, never slowing down to develop the characters\u2019 motivations or give them anything of substance. While the movie is full of excitement and has all the basics of an underdog story, the heart and soul are not there enough to allow this movie to be any greater than it could have been. The film is only 92 minutes long with credits, and when you have a movie to this scale, it really should have had more time to breathe and allow the sequences to take shape.\nBut what about the voice cast? Chris Pratt got some internet ridicule over his Mario voice from the trailers that sounded a lot like, well, Chris Pratt. However, he is excellent in the movie. An early scene establishes that Pratt is fully capable of doing a game-accurate Mario voice while also demonstrating how annoying the film would be if he spoke that way the entire time. He brings a perfectly appropriate Brooklyn accent to the character and sounds great every time he does one of Mario\u2019s catchphrases, which is crucial to nail.\nDay and Joy are excellent as Luigi and Peach, but the rest of the cast outshines them. Black is phenomenal as Bowser, offering a villainous voice to his role as King of the Koopas. Key is unrecognizable as Toad, bringing a fantastic vibrance to his character. Seth Rogen brings his trademark voice and laugh to Donkey Kong, the only role that may take you out of the experience a little since all you hear is Rogen. But he\u2019s fun to listen to, and the comedically gifted cast elevates the irreverent humor within this film.\nThe Super Mario Bros. Movie is hilarious, offering many laugh-out-loud moments and fan service. The Mario Kart sequence is a standout, and the animation and character designs are incredible. While the film occasionally suffers from its abundance of overused \u201980s rock songs (including \u201cHolding Out For a Hero,\u201d which already appeared this past month in Shazam! Fury of the Gods and Tetris), composer Brian Tyler uses the iconic theme music at the right moments. While this movie is only about as good as Illumination films typically are, it\u2019s just fun enough to leave you wanting more and shouting, \u201cWahoo!\u201d\nSCORE: 7/10\nAs ComingSoon\u2019s review policy explains, a score of 7 equates to \u201cGood.\u201d A successful piece of entertainment that is worth checking out, but it may not appeal to everyone.",

        "text": "The Super Mario Bros. Movie review: A harmless, generic blur of kid\u2019s 'content'\nThe Super Mario Bros. Movie review: Humourless and boring, this isn\u2019t one to enjoy with your kids.\nVideo game adaptations are having a bit of a moment. In the last few years, we've seen beloved franchises brought to the big screen with irreverent flair in Detective Pikachu and the Sonic movies. We've seen action-packed sci-fi worlds hit the small screen with impressive scale in Showtime's Halo series. Most notably, earlier this year, HBO\u2019s The Last Of Us gave us the first prestige TV series adapted from a popular game. Not to mention a few forgettable, empty action vehicles along the way (Uncharted). There's even a Tetris movie out right now. (Yes, fine, that one\u2019s a drama about the making of the game, but I just wanted to include it okay?)\nEnter The Super Mario Bros. Movie. Based on Nintendo's smash-hit game sensation, the 3D animated adventure brings our favourite floating-box jumping, gold-coin-collecting plumbers to life. Directors Aaron Horvath and Michael Jelenic\u2019s film follows the fantastical origin story of brothers Mario (Chris Pratt, whose voice thankfully doesn\u2019t attract too much attention to itself) and Luigi (the far more capable voice actor, Charlie Day, who should be the lead of this movie, but more on that later).\nWe open in Brooklyn, New York where Mario and Luigi are actual plumbers who actually call themselves the Super Mario Bros. Having opened their own plumbing business, the two struggle to make a name for themselves. This quieter NYC-based opening leg of the film is dangerously at risk of being more interesting and enjoyable than any of the magical fantasy stuff that follows. The misadventures of two wacky, sincere plumbers trying to be taken seriously in the big city? Give me that movie.\nWhile trying to fix a burst pipe under the streets of Brooklyn, true to the game, our two Italian plumber protagonists discover a secret gateway to a magical world where they must defeat the evil turtle-bad-guy-leader Bowser (Jack Black) who\u2019s threatening to take over the place. (Seriously, who first came up with this stuff, what were they smoking and where can I get some??) Right on queue, as if the movie was pre-empting my question, Mario lands in the \u201cMushroom Kingdom\u201d. But he\u2019s been separated from Luigi, who got lost on the way and landed up in Bowser\u2019s territory. To save his brother, Mario must find Princess Peach (Anya Taylor-Joy) to help him rescue Luigi and defeat the evil Bowser.\nThere\u2019s no lack of visual flair in The Super Mario Bros Movie. The vibrant colour, the familiar whimsical world full of floating blocks, power-ups, and secret tunnels. It also has the right level of kinetic energy to keep things constantly in motion, jumping from one gag and/or action sequence to another. But it\u2019s far less imaginative and encouraging on paper.\nEverything that takes place between the initial setup to the (mostly) fun final battle (which takes us from a Mario Kart race to a climactic fight on the street of New York) plods along with little personality. We get Mario and Princess Peach going on an \u201cadventure\u201d across different landscapes made up of shoddy worldbuilding that can only be described as blurry-non-descript-much-wow-magical\u2026stuff.\nWhile the pointlessness of a tired 30-year-old film critic writing about a harmless, cosy, kids' movie isn\u2019t lost on me - we also happen to live in the golden age of kids' movies that are just as appealing to adults. Granted, The Super Mario Bros movie was never going to have the heartbreaking sincerity and emotional ambition of a Pixar film. But what it is missing is the zany, self-aware comedy that has made the made-for-children genre so enjoyable in recent years. We live in a post-Shrek world. In the twenty years since our favourite ogre, DreamWorks animation has given us the likes of Madagascar, Kung Fu Panda, The Croods, the delightful and sorely underrated gem that is Monsters Vs Aliens, and a whole lot more.\nEven Illumination Entertainment, the studio behind this Marios movie has mastered the art of funny, fuzzy, feel-good flicks with the Despicable Me and Minions movies. But we see none of that here. The Super Mario Bros movie is lifelessly low on laughs in its staunch refusal to poke fun at its inherently ridiculous world. Writer Matthew Fogel's script is desperately in need of what Hollywood calls a punch-up - getting comedy writers in to funny up the proceedings. And there\u2019s so much untapped comedic potential here with many inherently funny ideas that are lightly danced around but barely explored. Fred Armisen as the lovably theatrical leader of the apes. Seth Rogan as the self-obsessed, showboaty Donkey Kong. Keegan-Michael Key as the wonderfully weird, desperate-for-company Toad. Or the fact that what the evil Bowser wants most is to have \u201ca fairy-tale\u201d wedding with Princess Peach.\nFor what it\u2019s worth, I do appreciate the film\u2019s attempt at making the Princess a badass warrior with plenty of her own ass-kicking to do rather than just another damsel in need of saving. Instead, the damsel duties here are awarded to Luigi. He's the far more interesting, endearing character with the more touching arc - stumbling, constantly nervous, plagued by fear and forever relying on his brother to back him up. That is until he's forced to rise to the occasion and find his courage. But here, he\u2019s sidelined by his blander, more uninteresting brother. (I can\u2019t believe I have a hot take on the The Super Mario Bros movie of all things. Send help).\nA harmless, generic blur of kids \u201ccontent\u201d (I hate that word, but it feels painfully apt here), The Super Mario Bros movie isn\u2019t one to enjoy with your kids, as much as it is one you\u2019re forced to sit through because of them. Do children not deserve better than a 90-minute blur of cotton candy action? I guess the bajillion dollars this movie will no doubt do at the box office suggests otherwise.",

        "text": "The Super Mario Bros Movie Review: Promising Beginnings\nThe Super Mario Bros Movie has been released in cinemas, and yes, our review is coming out a bit late, but you know what they say: better late than never. I\u2019ve only recently been able to watch the movie, and I have some thoughts.\nThe first thing that I have to make very clear in this review is that I am a huge Super Mario fan. I\u2019m actually a huge Nintendo fan. I\u2019ve played most of the Mario video games on the likes of the NES, the SNES, the Nintendo 64, the Game Cube, the Wii, the Wii U (yep, I owned that console), and the Nintendo Switch.\nIt\u2019s easily one of the best-ever video game franchises. However, Nintendo has been very cautious about making another Mario movie since the 1993 Super Mario Bros movie was released. That move really spooked the company since it was really not what they expected, and the film bombed at the box office.\nTo be honest, I don\u2019t think anybody expected that movie, which starred Bob Hoskins as Mario and John Leguizamo as Luigi. That film was a catastrophe, although I\u2019ve discovered pretty recently that there are fans of that film, much to my amazement.\nWhen it was announced that Nintendo was partnering up with Illumination to make a new animated Mario Bros movie, I was really excited because I have loved a lot of Illumination\u2019s previous work. I like the Despicable Me films, the Sing movies and I love the Minions films. Yes, I have a soft spot for the Minions.\nThe Super Mario Bros Movie doesn\u2019t suck!\nREAD MORE: The Legend Of Zelda Tears Of The Kingdom Release Date, Story & More\nSo, I\u2019m happy to report that this new animated Super Mario Bros movie is a lot better than the 1993 live-action version. I would argue that it\u2019s the best possible movie that we have hoped for.\nIt\u2019s no secret that Nintendo is very, very cautious these days about what is made outside of its video games using its IPs. This means that it would have been rather difficult for Illumination to really push any boundaries with this film.\nI think, given the constraints, Illumination did a really good job with this film. Yes, the plot is very simplistic. I get that. However, it\u2019s a Super Mario Bros movie, so I\u2019m not really sure what people expected.\nI liked the backstory that the movie\u2019s writer, Matthew Fogel, came up with for Mario and Luigi in this movie. They\u2019re actually plumbers from the \u2018real world\u2019. They live and work in Brooklyn, and I think that was the right way to go about it.\nIt has a very simple plot, but that\u2019s not a bad thing\nREAD MORE: Daredevil Season 4 Potential Release Date, Cast, Story & Everything You Need To Know\nI also quite liked the movie\u2019s overall plot. Yes, as I mentioned before, it\u2019s very simplistic. However, let\u2019s not forget that this is a movie based on platforming video games. We\u2019re not really here for the story. We\u2019re really here for the journey and the experience of being with these characters and in these locations.\nMoreover, The Super Mario Bros Movie doesn\u2019t have a \u2018save the Princess\u2019 story, which is the case for most Super Mario video games. It\u2019s actually a \u2018save Luigi\u2019 storyline, with a sprinkling of \u2018save the Mushroom Kingdom\u2019 subplot thrown in.\nI also wasn\u2019t thrown by the movie\u2019s voice acting. There was a lot of talk about Chris Pratt being the voice of Mario, but I was pretty on board with him as Mario from the very beginning. I also loved Charles Martinet\u2019s cameos in the film. He\u2019s the voice of Mario in the video games.\nCharlie Day, Anya Taylor-Joy, Seth Rogen and Fred Armisen were all pretty solid. However, the standout, for me at least, was Jack Black as Bowser. He was perfect in the role, and his \u2018Peaches\u2019 song was just brilliant. I think that might end up getting a Grammy and an Oscar nomination.\nThe only voice actor that I wasn\u2019t wowed by was Keegan-Michael Key as Toad, and that\u2019s more because his voice was so altered that I kind of wondered why they even bothered hiring him to do the voice in the first place.\nSuper Mario Bros fans will love this movie\nREAD MORE: Peacemaker Season 2 Potential Release Date, Cast, Story & Everything You Need To Know\nAs a Mario fan, I had a blast with this movie. However, here comes the kicker. I think that my love of and familiarity with the games actually made me like the movie even more. I do think it\u2019s a very good family movie. Yet, if you\u2019re an adult with very little knowledge of the games, the film might feel a bit weak.\nThe story is a little bit paper thin, and some of the set pieces are really geared to get you into nostalgia mode in the sense that they remind you of playing the video games\u2019 platforming levels.\nI think that if you\u2019re looking for a strong animated movie, with a great plot, interesting themes and that has something to say about the world we live in, The Super Mario Bros Movie isn\u2019t the film for you. This isn\u2019t a Pixar feature. It isn\u2019t a Puss In Boots 2 or a Guillermo Del Torro\u2019s Pinocchio. It\u2019s not a Hayao Miyazaki masterpiece.\nThe Super Mario Bros Movie is a fun animated feature which involves one of the world\u2019s most famous and beloved video game characters. It\u2019s got colourful visuals, fun set pieces, a lot of jokes, some great musical cues from the games and a paper-thin plot.\nI had fun with it, and I was happy to finally watch a Super Mario Bros movie that didn\u2019t suck. There will be more of these films in the future, and they might start getting a bit more adventurous with them.\nBut, for now, what Nintendo and Illumination wanted was to make a movie that would make a lot of money and not tank the franchise from the very beginning. That\u2019s what they delivered.\nWhat do you make of this review? Let us know your thoughts in the comments below.\nWhat do you make of this story?

        "text": "When \"The Super Mario Bros. Movie\" opened in theaters earlier this month, the experts were ready to count out the computer-animated film as another disposable video-game byproduct like the colossally awful, 1993 live-action take on the 1985 Nintendo game. Not so fast.\nCritics jeered, but audiences came in droves. Having already cleaned up with more than $700 million worldwide, \"The Super Mario Bros. Movie\" is now the biggest box-office hit of 2023, setting records for the largest global opening ever for an animated film. How far can it go? Do I hear a billion? Easy.\nWhat happened? Parents starved for family entertainment, that's what happened. There's also the fact that \"The Super Mario Bros. Movie\" is way more fun even for non-gamers than skeptics predicted. Repeat business is off the charts. So get over your hesitation and jump aboard.\nDon't expect miracles. Even at 93 minutes, the movie can drift into dull and derivative. Still, I think it's an asset that \"The Super Mario Bros. Movie\" is aimed at 5-year-olds of all ages, meaning the child in all of us. Look elsewhere, maybe \"Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves,\" for winking adult references. It's the dedication to silliness that makes \"Mario\" such an impish delight.\nAs directed by Aaron Horvath and Michael Jelenic, from a script by Matthew Fogel, the film doesn't even try to reinvent the genre. It only wants to capture enough of the joystick energy of the game to cover the sins of merch pedaling and thin plotting and characterization.\nFears about ethnic stereotyping emerged from the voice casting of non-Italian Chris Pratt as Mario. Relax. Pratt uses his own voice to play the mustachioed Italian plumber in overalls. Ditto Charlie Day as his shy brother Luigi. Both put on exaggerated Italian accents in a TV ad for the bros' Brooklyn plumbing business, then revert to normal. Problem solved? Pretty much.\nTrouble starts immediately as Mario and Luigi go underground to fix a manhole leak and are sucked into a warp pipe that sends them into two separate universes. Mario lands in the Mushroom Kingdom, ruled by Princess Peach (Anya Taylor-Joy in fine, frisky form).\nPoor Luigi is zapped into the Dark Lands controlled by the evil King Koopa, Bowser, a kind of demonic turtle with red eyebrows who finds the perfect verbal pairing in wild man Jack Black. Bowser yearns for Princess Peach and will destroy her kingdom if she refuses to marry him.\nMario, who is also hot for Peach, can't have that, plus he needs to rescue Luigi from Bowser and form an alliance with the Kong family of gorillas by showing that he -- even in a cat suit -- can win a fight with the king's son Donkey Kong (Seth Rogen doing a great Seth Rogen).\nGot that? No matter. The plot is just a flimsy excuse to have these characters mix it up one more time on the big screen. Live action can't cut it. The first \"Mario\" movie proved that by staying rigidly earthbound.\nThe real secret behind the unexpected and staggering success of \"The Super Mario Bros. Movie\" is animation, which niftily catches the anarchy of gaming. It creates the illusion that anything is possible. It's also the next best thing to playing the actual game, which continues to thrive and multiply.\nCan the movie spawn its own hive of sequels? Two words: Game on.",

        "text": "The Super Mario Bros Movie review: A sojourn to Nostalgia Land\nStory highlights\nThe Super Mario Bros. Movie manages to bring the vibrant world of the popular video game franchise to life on the big screen with stunning animation and exciting action. However, the thinly written plot and lacklustre dialogue make it clear that this movie was made more for fans than the general audience.\nThe Super Mario Bros. Movie manages to bring the vibrant world of the popular video game franchise to life on the big screen with stunning animation and exciting action. However, the thinly written plot and lacklustre dialogue make it clear that this movie was made more for fans than the general audience.\nIt's a bird, it's a plane, it's...Mario? I must admit, I was sceptical going into The Super Mario Bros. Movie. Video game adaptations have a reputation for being terrible, but this one wasn't half bad. It's colourful, fast-paced, and delivers some satisfying fan service for longtime fans of the Mario franchise. But this is also clear that this movie was made more for the fans than for the general movie-going audience. With a plot so thin you could roll it up and stick it in your pocket, it relies heavily on nostalgia and Easter eggs to carry it along.\nThe Super Mario Bros. Movie follows the story of Mario (Chris Pratt) and Luigi (Charlie Day), two plumbers from Brooklyn who get sucked into a Warp Pipe and end up in different kingdoms. Mario ends up in the Mushroom Kingdom ruled by Princess Peach (Anya Taylor Joy), while Luigi lands in the Dark Lands ruled by the Koopa king Bowser (Jack Black). Bowser plans to marry Peach and destroy the Mushroom Kingdom if that fails. He imprisons Luigi to blackmail Mario, who he sees as competition for Peach's favour. It is the classic Mario story.\nLet's start with the good. The animation is pretty nice, bursting with vibrant colours and fluid movements that make it feel like you are watching the characters from some of the newer versions of the video game come to life on the big screen. The Mushroom Kingdom and the Dark Lands are brought to life in truly stunning detail. The action is also mostly exciting, with plenty of jumping, running, chasing, getting power-ups, and dodging fireballs and rivers of lava involved. There are nods to the original games scattered throughout the movie, from the recognisable sound effects and musical cues to the power-ups like the Super Star and the Cat Suit.\nHowever, the movie's overreliance on nostalgia and fan service also proves to be its downfall. The plot feels like an afterthought, a mere vehicle to showcase the various locations and characters from the games. It is barely more than a flimsy excuse to string together a series of set pieces. Voice actors do their best with what they are given, but there's only so much one can do with such thinly written roles. The dialogue in the movie is a lacklustre affair, punctuated by trite quips that seem to be directly lifted from a low-budget animated series.\nAlso Read: Super Mario Bros Movie: From a plumber to a global sensation, the fascinating origin story of Mario\nIn the grand scheme of things, The Super Mario Bros. Movie is a small blip on the radar of video game adaptations. It's not the worst one out there, but it's certainly not the best. However, it's a testament to the enduring popularity of the Mario franchise that people are still interested in seeing these characters on the big screen, even after all these years. One of the strengths of these games has always been their ability to appeal to a wide range of audiences. Kids and adults alike can enjoy the colourful worlds and zany characters that populate the games. The movie is able to capture that same sense of joy and wonder, bringing to life its world in a way that feels true to the source material.\nThe Super Mario Bros. Movie is not exactly very 'super', but it is still a fun, nostalgic trip down memory lane that's worth checking out for fans of the franchise. Just remember to check your expectations at the Warp Pipe.\nWATCH WION LIVE HERE\nYou can now write for wionews.com and be a part of the community. Share your stories and opinions with us here.",

        "text": "Star Cast: Chris Pratt, Anya Taylor-Joy, Charlie Day, Jack Black, Seth Rogen, Kevin Michael Richardson\nDirector: Aaron Horvath, Michael Jelenic\nWhat\u2019s Good: Mario finally has a film that doesn\u2019t suck as much as 1993\u2019s Bob Hoskins starrer, but that\u2019s not a compliment, though!\nWhat\u2019s Bad: It\u2019s not as bad as I would make this out to be in my review, but it has hurt my feelings\nLoo Break: Nope, you\u2019ll either switch this off midway or watch it till the end with the hope of it getting better\nWatch or Not?: Only if you\u2019re below 12 or a die-hard Mario fanatic\nAvailable On: Theatrical release\nRuntime: 104 Minutes\nUser Rating:\nMario (voiced by Chris Pratt) & Luigi (voiced by Charlie Day) are two endeavouring PlumBros (Plumber Brothers) living in Brooklyn, who one day jump in a pipe only to find themselves in a different universe, i.e. the Mushroom Kingdom.\nLuigi finds himself in Dark Lands, ruled by the Koopa King Bowser (voiced by Jack Black), who now has the \u2018star\u2019 to power up and destroy the Mushroom Kingdom if its Princess Peach doesn\u2019t agree to marry him.\nSo, of course, as Mario has to save his brother from the baddie, Princess wants to save herself & her kingdom, and they both unite to make the plot even more predictable than it already is.\nThe Super Mario Bros. Movie Review: Script Analysis\nMatthew Fogel, one of the three writers from The Lego Movie, fails to carry forward the intelligent humour and instead does a fan service, and that\u2019s the problem; you may ask why? Because the fans of this game are either kids or humans who have lost their childhood. This doesn\u2019t justify Shigeru Miyamoto\u2019s (Mario\u2019s creator) age-old vision of visualising the Mushroom Kingdom. That deserves Pixar-like sensibilities. Though the movie stays true to the game by using many nerdy references (like the \u2018question mark\u2019 boxes, the bullet bill, and power-ups), it isn\u2019t backed by an equally intriguing narrative for the characters.\nIconic keyphrases like \u201cSorry Mario, the princess is in another castle\u201d are thrown away only to get a bland outcome as a result. For those who are unaware, Mario wasn\u2019t supposed to be a plumber at first, he was a carpenter & he made his debut in the classic arcade game Donkey Kong as the protagonist trying to save his girlfriend from the Ape. Taking a similar template, making Mario the Italian plumber, which became his permanent identity, Miyamoto separated it from Donkey Kong only to reunite them once again for this film. They deserved a much better-written frenemy subplot to celebrate the reunion properly.\nThe Super Mario Bros. Movie Review: Star Performance\nThere was something about Chris Pratt\u2018s voice in The Lego Movie, or maybe it was just a good story, which he failed to replicate and instead gave a generic sh*t-load of crap. Apart from the stereotypical Italian traits like saying \u2018Mamma-Mia\u2019, Pratt butchers the iconic phrases \u201cIt\u2019s-a me, Mario! & Let\u2019s-a go!\u201d.\nCharles Martinet was RIGHT THERE! He has been the official voice of Mario since forever & in 2022, he also stopped posting his voice videos (he started from Vine) after Nintendo apparently asked him to. How do we know? A fan texted Charles asking if he was asked to do so, to which he said, \u201cThanks for understanding\u201d, only proving he could\u2019ve brought it back if the studio could\u2019ve made one right decision in favour of the film.\nSeth Rogen said the 1993\u2019s live-action version of Super Mario Bros. is \u2018one of the worst films ever made\u2019; that\u2019s his opinion, but he says that after watching the generic mess they\u2019ve made with this one, that\u2019s the contract speaking. Jack Black is the only one who got the assignment right, lending his eccentric voice to Browser, the evil Turtle. Anya Taylor-Joy and Charlie Day are just about okay.\nThe Super Mario Bros. Movie Review: Direction, Music\nAaron Horvath and Michael Jelenic bring back the nostalgia but at what cost? It\u2019s harmless fun, which is at the bottom of the expectations meter we, as the fans, had from the film. Mario, Luigi\u2019s half-baked bond remains the primary reason you couldn\u2019t connect with the protagonist\u2019s emotional journey of freeing his brother.\nBrian Tyler has brilliantly recreated Koji Kondo\u2019s original theme, but it\u2019s constrained. There\u2019s a great scene in which Bowser plays the Piano on Mario\u2019s underground theme, which makes you feel to plead for more such moments.\nThe Super Mario Bros.

        "text": "The popular animation studio Illumination hasn\u2019t had a great track record since its release of \u201cDespicable Me\u201d in 2010, with forgettable projects like \u201cThe Grinch,\u201d \u201cSing\u201d and numerous \u201cDespicable Me\u201d and \u201cMinions\u201d spinoffs. While its latest release, \u201cThe Super Mario Bros. Movie,\u201d doesn\u2019t quite reach the high bar set by 2022\u2019s animated kid\u2019s movie \u201cPuss in Boots: The Last Wish,\u201d it easily leaps over the tripping hazard of most Illumination movies.\n\u201cThe Super Mario Bros. Movie\u201d is of course based on the internationally popular Nintendo game franchise, drawing inspiration from series \u2014 like Mario Kart, Donkey Kong and Super Mario. The story follows Mario (Chris Pratt) venturing across worlds with the help of Princess Peach (Anya Taylor-Joy), Toad (Keegan-Michael Key) and Donkey Kong (Seth Rogan) to save his brother Luigi (Charlie Day) from the villain Bowser (Jack Black). The movie was released to theaters April 5, and according to Box Office Mojo, earned over $204 million domestically and over $375 million globally in its first weekend.\nThe movie, written by Matthew Fogel, has a star-studded cast of voice actors, notably Chris Pratt as the titular character Mario. This was a casting choice that drew controversy on whether he would fit the iconic Mario voice \u2014 performed by Charles Martinet in the games \u2014 Nintendo fans are accustomed to. While it was a bit of an initial shock to hear Pratt as Mario, it didn\u2019t take away from the soul of the character and was easy to adjust to as the movie progressed. The other actors did an admirable job putting their own spin on the iconic characters as well \u2014 particularly Black\u2019s Bowser, who performed several musical numbers and a decent amount of dialogue.\nThe story and humor of \u201cThe Super Mario Bros. Movie\u201d are also handled surprisingly well. People who have seen Illumination movies may expect a heavy dose of childish jokes, and even though the humor is mostly family friendly, it does a much better job of being accessible to different age groups than previous projects such as \u201cMinions.\u201d While there\u2019s a lot of plot to fit into a 92-minute runtime, it stays focused and ties up everything cohesively while also clearly leaving room for sequels.\nThe plot may move faster than a Bullet Bill, but there\u2019s plenty of easter eggs and surprises for fans of the games to enjoy. It\u2019s a little bit \u201cAlice in Wonderland,\u201d a little bit \u201cMad Max: Fury Road\u201d and a whole lot of Nintendo. \u201cThe Super Mario Bros. Movie\u201d is a power-up for Illumination and a pleasant surprise for die-hard and casual Mario fans alike.\nRating: 4/5",

        "text": "Thirty years ago, Disney subsidiary Hollywood Pictures produced a big screen adaptation of the popular Nintendo game Super Mario Bros., taking the sparse existing story content and extrapolating it into a bizarre and outrageous urban fantasy that ultimately bore little resemblance to the source material. This wasn\u2019t all that unusual at the time, when film adaptations of novels, comics, and TV series commonly retained only the broad strokes of their parent works. Still, people hated it. Critics found it a weird and disjointed commercial cash grab, and fans of the games found it unrecognizable. In the years since, however, as film adaptations have become more slavishly loyal to their plots and established iconography, big, weird swings like that \u201893 Mario Bros. have been reevaluated within Millennial film crit circles. Directors Rocky Morton and Annabel Jankel brought a great deal of imagination to their take on the portly Italian plumber\u2019s adventures through the Mushroom Kingdom, the kind of oddball creativity that, by and large, studios do not permit anymore, especially when it comes to adapting established properties.\n|\n|\nTHE SUPER MARIO BROS. MOVIE \u2605\u2605 (2/4 stars)\nThe Super Mario Bros. Movie, the new animated film from Nintendo and Illumination, is the 1993 film\u2019s exact opposite. It is a completely on-model, by-the-numbers translation of the Super Mario Bros. video-game franchise, incorporating as much familiar imagery as possible while adding practically nothing. For the Mario fan in your household, young or old, it\u2019s likely exactly what they want it to be. However, if you\u2019ve somehow managed to go through life without having any attachment to the character, there is absolutely no reason for you to watch it.\nMario (Chris Pratt doing a voice, but not the voice) is a friendly but scrappy plumber from Brooklyn who\u2019s recently started his own business with his cowardly brother, Luigi (Charlie Day). In an effort to prove their worth and drum up business, the Mario Bros. delve deep into the sewers of New York and discover a hidden portal to a colorful world populated by adorable mushroom people and one human woman, Peach (Anya Taylor-Joy), whose action hero hypercompetence has earned her a place as their Princess. Luigi gets kidnapped by Bowser (Jack Black), a giant turtle monster who wants to rule the world, but not quite as much as he wants to marry Peach. Mario and Peach team up to defeat Bowser and save his brother and her kingdom, respectively, facing a variety of challenges that happen to represent different types of Mario games and stages. There\u2019s a contest between Mario and boastful gorilla Donkey Kong (Seth Rogan) that\u2019s a cross between the classic Donkey Kong game and Super Smash Bros. There\u2019s a street race down Rainbow Road that incorporates all the latest gameplay gimmicks from Mario Kart 8. There\u2019s a throwaway joke about a mini game from Mario Party called \u201cToad Scramble.\u201d\nIf none of what I just said makes any sense to you, then you are not the audience for this movie. That\u2019s not to say that little kids won\u2019t have a good time, even if they don\u2019t recognize that Peach\u2019s Castle in this film is exactly as it appears in Super Mario 64. The Super Mario Bros. Movie is a totally functional animated kids movie. It\u2019s silly, it moves fast, it has a million little guys in it whose toys are on shelves now. I saw this film in a theater packed with kids, albeit the kids of parents who felt motivated to bring their toddlers and preschoolers to the earliest possible screening of the new Mario movie on the Thursday morning of its release. They all had a terrific time. The kids pointed excitedly at the screen and said \u201cThat\u2019s Luigi!\u201d each time Luigi appeared. The adults chuckled when one of Peach\u2019s royal guards said \u201cYour princess is in another castle.\u201d It\u2019s fundamentally the same experience for either age group. The more familiar you are with Mario, the more little coins of recognition you\u2019re going to collect, and the higher the movie will score with you.\nThat is, unless you\u2019re like me, a curmudgeon who dislikes being pandered to. (See: my reviews of Star Trek: Picard, The Mandalorian, The Last of Us, etc.) Of course I recognize the dozens of musical motifs from the 35-year history of the Mario franchise that are scattered throughout the film, and of course I love those tunes, and of course I jotted them all down in my little notebook. I appreciate that even newer characters like Mayor Paulina and the Lumas make appearances alongside ubiquitous classics like Parakoopas and Shy Guys. But that\u2019s most of what The Super Mario Bros. Movie is: a massive assemblage of things you already like, arranged into a coherent order for digestion as a single, 92-minute product. It is the laziest possible version of a Mario movie, and for most viewers, young and old, that\u2019ll be totally acceptable.\nBut here\u2019s the thing: It doesn\u2019t have to be.\nHang onto your joycons, because I, a film critic, am about to say something nice about those Sonic the Hedgehog movies, and here it is: They\u2019re movies. Both the 2020 Sonic film and its sequel have their own story that is unique from any of the games, cartoons, or comics that make up the Sonic franchise, introducing their own characters, settings, setpieces, and ideas. They\u2019re not a total reinvention like the 1993 Super Mario Bros., but they do have a spark of originality to them. They are distinct products from the works that inspired them, and they have a reason to exist, outside of the context of Sonic fandom. And, cumulatively, they have grossed over $700 million. The Super Mario Bros. Movie is not so much a movie as a speedrun through the history of Mario, from the Donkey Kong arcade cabinet to the Nintendo Switch, a crash course for people who, by and large, do not need it. They\u2019ve either already lived it or are currently immersed in it. Will they enjoy the experience? Sure. Even I had a pretty good time, and I\u2019m busy here constructing a rant protesting it. Will it make a billion dollars? Almost certainly, and you can look forward to seeing a new one of these every two to three years, and a Legend of Zelda movie, and a Metroid movie, and a Kirby movie, until the bubble finally bursts in 2038 and we start getting movies based on TikTok memes instead.\nWhat I\u2019m saying is, we can and should expect more from a movie than a recital of things we already love. I\u2019m not asking for Children of Men; I know I\u2019ve just bought a ticket to the cartoon plumber movie. I only ask that you add something to the recipe you\u2019ve inherited. It can be done. Look at Into the Spider-Verse. Look at the goddamn Lego Movie. Hollywood has given you a blank check. You don\u2019t have to write it out to \u201cCash.\u201d\nObserver Reviews are regular assessments of new and noteworthy cinema.",

        "text": "The Super Mario Bros. Movie is a massive box office hit, setting the record for the highest opening weekend box office for any animated movie in history, despite mixed reviews and a \"Rotten\" score in Rotten Tomatoes. The fabled \"video game movie curse\" has plagued video game adaptations for years, going all the way back to the original 1993 live-action Super Mario Bros. movie, with game movie frequently failing to get good reviews, audience acceptance, or box office, but The Super Mario Bros. Movie defies most of those historical problems on its path to a massive opening weekend box office.\nWith a 56 percent Rotten Tomatoes score, The Super Mario Bros. Movie has a \"Rotten\" score, although its reviews just barely lean positive while splitting critics almost straight down the middle. Even so, The Super Mario Bros. Movie opened to $368 million at the global box office, beating the previous record, Frozen II, to become the biggest opening weekend box office in history. For comparison, Frozen II was much better reviewed and has a \"Fresh\" 77 percent score in Rotten Tomatoes. Obviously, The Super Mario Bros. Movie's success is a major coup. Here's how it set the new animated movie box office record despite bad reviews.\nSuper Mario is One of the Biggest Media Franchises in the World\nFirst of all, when it comes to the Mario IP, the label \"animated movie\" or \"video game movie\" don't do justice to how massively popular the Nintendo property is. According to Statista, Super Mario is the eighth highest-grossing media franchise in the world with an estimated total gross of $34.6 billion, barely behind the Marvel Cinematic Universe at $35.3 billion as of January 2001. Mario is the single most recognizable video game character of all time, and one of the most iconic fictional characters of all time, comparable to Mickey Mouse, Superman, and Darth Vader.\nEven for people who don't play video games, Mario is as big as Nintendo itself, and for a time could have been seen as nearly synonymous with video games like Xerox was to photocopy machines or Kleenex to facial tissues. As such, even with bad reviews, the brand iconography and name recognition were more than enough to propel The Super Mario Bros. Movie to an exceptional opening weekend box office. Aided by popular voice actors like Chris Pratt, Jack Black, Seth Rogen, and more, The Super Mario Bros. Movie was destined to make a major opening weekend splash at the box office no matter what Rotten Tomatoes score it had.\nRotten Tomatoes Audience Scores Are More Important Than Critic Score for Box Office\nDespite the Rotten 56 percent Rotten Tomatoes score, The Super Mario Bros. Movie has an exceptional 96 percent audience score. While critic scores certainly have an impact on the box office, movie performance is more closely related to Rotten Tomatoes audience scores than critic scores. A good audience score certainly can't carry a movie to box office glory on its own, but it can overcome a bad critic score, while a good critic score and a bad audience score almost never thrives at the box office.\nSince audiences love The Super Mario Bros. Movie, its box office success will likely continue past its smash hit opening weekend thanks to good word of mouth. The strong audience response isn't only visible in Rotten Tomatoes, but The Super Mario Bros. Movie also earned an \"A\" Cinemascore, measured by on-site post-screening surveys which have long been used to measure audience sentiment. Of course, the best measurement of audience sentiment is usually box office as consumers vote with their wallets, so Mario's huge box office is pretty solid proof the Rotten Tomatoes critic score isn't a major deterrent.\nThe Super Mario Bros. Movie Serves an Important Kids & Family Demographic\nOne of the biggest pillars of theatrical box office revenue is kids and family movies, and while there've been a few recent movies released for kids and families, they've been fewer and farther between, so The Super Mario Bros. Movie is filling a major gap and its massive box office shows the audience demand for this kind of entertainment. By their nature, kids and family movies bring massive boosts to ticket sales and also help fill theaters during matinees and earlier screenings, utilizing time slots that aren't as profitable from other movie-going audiences.\nMinions: The Rise of Gru and Puss in Boots: The Last Wish were both big animated hits in 2022, but so far 2023 has been mostly lacking for any new animated offerings before The Super Mario Bros. Movie. Fortunately, a number of other highly anticipated theatrical animated films are coming later this year including Pixar's Elemental, Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem, and Trolls 3.\nInflation Helped The Super Mario Bros. Movie Set Box Office Records\nOf course, one of the biggest factors in The Super Mario Bros. Movie setting box office records is because of changes in the value of the dollar due to inflation. The value of the dollar has shifted significantly since Frozen II released in 2019, so its $358 global opening would actually equal $418 in 2023 dollars, which is far more than The Super Mario Bros. Movie. The same is true for other popular animated movies like The Incredibles II, which also has a bigger opening weekend than The Super Mario Bros. Movie when adjusted for inflation.\nThis doesn't take anything away from The Super Mario Bros. Movie's massive success, as its opening weekend is one of the biggest of all time either way, but the only reason it's setting the new #1 record is because of inflation. The difference to Frozen II's inflation-adjusted opening is close enough that strong legs could carry The Super Mario Bros. Movie to pass Frozen II in total box office by the end of its run, but its overall performance has yet to be seen in the coming weeks.\nAfter a popular marketing campaign, The Super Mario Bros. Movie's mixed reviews initially seemed to pour some cold water on the enthusiasm for the movie prior to release, but now that it's finally in theaters and audiences are seeing it, the review scores and box office earnings make it clear it's a verified hit, despite its Rotten Tomatoes score. With the massive box office opening, a sequel and spin-offs are certainly on the way, and while Nintendo and Illumination Entertainment surely want to see stronger critic scores next time, The Super Mario Bros. Movie proves strong critical reviews aren't necessary for a big box office hit.",

        "text": "When Mario\u2019s brother Luigi is captured by Bowser (the terrible turtle), Mario needs the help of Princess Peach, with her heart-shaped bangs and immovable crown to save the day.\nFrom the production company \u2018Illumination\u2019 \u2013 who gave us the irrepressible Minions, Sing & The Secret Life of Pets, brings us the stunning visual spectacle that is The Super Mario Bros Movie.\nBased on the original computer game by Nintendo, Super Mario Bros has been a popular, family friendly series of games that have brought us an ever-evolving multitude of highly addictive game play. With the character\u2019s first introduction into the arcade world over 40 years ago; Mario \u2013 known then as \u2018Jump Man\u2019 \u2013 was part of the Donkey Kong arcade game and originally designed to be a carpenter. However he soon transitioned into a plumber and over the coming decades, Nintendo spun the character off and gave us a whole new world filled with colourful settings.\nWith the typical Hollywood trend for massive budget productions and A-list casts, here we are given the vocal delights of Anya Taylor Joy (who will most certainly provide more voiceovers) as Princess Peach, Jack Black (who was born for this role) as Bowser with Chris Pratt as our title character and Charlie Day as Luigi.\nYou can imagine, even with their huge catalogue of games over the years, a new Super Mario Bros movie could\u2019ve still been a gamble. Given that the 1993 live action version, starring Bob Hoskins and John Leguizamo, was such a critical and financial flop, it put Nintendo off granting any studio the rights to make a film based on their properties\u2026 until now.\nIn the opening of the film set in Brooklyn, New York, we see Mario & Luigi\u2019s life as plumbers at an all time low. Cue a news broadcast of a flooded New York and their mission begins in amongst the underground pipework that takes us beautifully (if never explained) into the multicolour world of Princess Peach\u2019s Mushroom Kingdom.\nThe transition from the bleak \u2018real world\u2019 to the magical Mushroom Kingdom provides a great visual, almost \u2018Wizard of Oz\u2019 like contrast, showing off some incredible advancements in computer animation. This fish (or rather Cheep Cheep) out of water story provides plenty of basic comedy here. However, the film really kicks off when Mario learns that his brother is in trouble and must rely on the help of Peach and the ever-brave Toad to recruit the army of the Kong Kingdom to fight Bowser. From here we get brilliant nods to other games like \u2018Super Smash Bros\u2019 and \u2018Mario Kart\u2019 which you won\u2019t be able to stop smiling at and yet somehow don\u2019t feel forced into the story.\nThe film can be divided into two categories. The first being the incredible animation that has Illumination really stepping up their game. From the Mushroom Kingdom, to the iconic rainbow racetrack and the lush jungles of the Kong empire, everything is spectacularly (and faithfully) rendered. With a typical animation production of 4-5 years, they\u2019ve really nailed the look of all the worlds to please crowds young and old who\u2019ve enjoyed the games over the past 40 years.\nThe second being the script, or rather the lack of any real story here, is such a shame. There are the nods we expect to see and what we get is an enjoyable 93 minutes of turn your brain off fun. But even with the amazing animation, we\u2019ve seen better in the recent past (story and character wise) with the likes of The Lego Movies, whose humour was spot on and could appeal to audiences both young and old. So you can\u2019t help but feel that Mario Bros was designed for a younger audience (and that\u2019s okay). There are still some subtle jokes for the adults, but it left the whole experience a little wanting, with some notable moments where the humour could\u2019ve been pushed further.\nAt the time of writing this, the film has shattered worldwide box office records, so an inevitable sequel must be on the way. Hopefully they can correct a few of these shortcomings by then, but in the meantime there\u2019s a lot to enjoy in this first outing.\nAuthor: Piers, Maidstone Store",

        "text": "The highly anticipated Super Mario Bros. Movie is premiering in Malaysia this week, slightly later than the rest of the world. In some ways, however, that\u2019s a good thing as it\u2019s meant I\u2019ve gotten a look at the rather divisive reception the movie has received so far.\nI\u2019m a long-time fan of Mario and Nintendo but I also know that these games aren\u2019t exactly beloved for their deep story-telling so I was concerned about a new movie would turn out, especially one made by Illumination Studios, who I will never forgive for bringing The Minions into this world.\nAfter sitting down and watching the movie, it definitely had more good than bad. The animation was stellar but the writing and character left much to be desired which is a real shame as there was a lot of potential with the character interactions that just didn\u2019t feel as realized as it could have been.\nThe Mario Bros\nThe plot of Super Mario Bros is more or less what you\u2019d expect. Mario (Chris Pratt) and Luigi (Charlie Day) are opening a plumbing business, and while working on a large drain, they find a pipe that takes them to the Mushroom Kingdom but separates the two of them. Luigi lands near the Ttranical Bowser (Jack Black) and is captured, while Mario lands near Peach\u2019s castle with the Princess (Anya Taylor-Joy) enlisting him to help fight off Bowser since the majority of the Toads are just kinda cowards (that\u2019s basically the explanation they give in the movie).\nThe first thing I really have to praise the movie for is how unafraid it was of being a Mario movie. So many video game movies feel that need to be \u201cgrounded\u201d, and that they need to ease people into the game bits because they might be \u201ctoo strange\u201d. It\u2019s why the Sonic Movie needed to be set in the human world or why the Mortal Kombat movie needed a bland original protagonist. The Mario movie just drops you into the Mushroom Kingdom and lets everything loose.\nThis is just a world where mushroom people travel via pipes, gorillas can talk and drive karts, and random \u201cpower-ups\u201d are just scattered throughout the land. This is a fantasy world and the culture and practices of the people don\u2019t need to align with the real world. I\u2019d heavily admire that the film has the confidence to simply play it straight and trust the audience will understand.\nA Jump Forward Into Animation\nThis is further backed by the fact that this is probably the best-looking movie Illumination has ever made. The Mushroom Kindom looks gorgeous, managing to be faithful to the game but still with a few details and touchups to make it feel truly alive. The texture of each model, from Mario\u2019s overalls to the lava spurting from Bowser\u2019s flying castle is excellently done.\nThe animation likewise makes the action scenes truly breathtaking. Each fight scene is exceptionally choreographed, making great use of verticality to show Mario jumping, climbing, and stomping his way through each fight. The scenes create a real sense of wonder as Mario and his friends make great use of different Mario power-ups, and enemies so that each fight feels greater than the last. I never knew how much a wanted to see a Mad Max-style vehicular combat scene using Mario Kart but it was truly spectacular and was when the movie felt most alive.\nThe thing is though, between these brilliant action scenes, you need slower scenes that really establish the motives and personality of the characters and overall allow the setting and tone to sink in. This is where the Mario movie runs into trouble.\nMovies Need To Have a Story\nI\u2019ll admit the above sub-heading above is a little exaggerated but it presents the biggest flaw with the Mario movie. Almost every establishing scene where the characters come together to talk and show more of who they feel is pretty much played on fast-forward. For example, when Mario and Peach first meet they seem to instantly be smitten. The Princess instantly gets to work training this guy she\u2019s never met and wants to get to know him better. It feels so scripted like it pretty much just exists just to set up the next action scene. Almost all the development-heavy scenes feel like this: rushed out of the way for more action.\nI\u2019ve already seen the defense for this online. \u201cThe Mario games didn\u2019t have a good story, so the movie doesn\u2019t need one\u201d, except it does. A \u201cgood story\u201d doesn\u2019t have to mean some deep philosophical drama, it just means the characters\u2019 motivations and development should feel natural and properly established.\nMario\u2019s entire story arc just doesn\u2019t feel cohesive. He\u2019s insecure about his family thinking he\u2019s a failure and should give up but little time is used to present these insecurities. There\u2019s a little and the beginning, a bit at the end before the final fight and he\u2019s over it. It feels very disjointed.\nSparks of Hope\nI think it\u2019s a shame as well because the Mario movie has some great ideas for character development but just doesn\u2019t flesh them out because of how fast-paced it is. We briefly see that part of the reason Peach finds Mario interesting is that he\u2019s from another world and she actually comes from another world and was adopted by the Toads. That\u2019s a fascinating idea and shows why these two people would end up liking each other, but it\u2019s never really brought up again.\nLikewise, Mario has a really strong bond with Luigi, but since Luigi spends most of the movie captured you barely see anything come from it. The beginning establishes that Mario thinks he\u2019s holding Luigi back, and when they\u2019re reunited at the climax there\u2019s a rousing speech about how the two are stronger together, except they\u2019ve done nothing together the entire movie so it just feels a little hollow. The Super Mario Bros. movie barely features one of the bros.\nThere is one exception, however. I really like what they did with Donkey Kong. The big ape has a rivalry with Mario and they work really well off each other. They\u2019re trading jabs, trying to show each other up and yet it\u2019s proven they\u2019re pretty similar deep down and when push comes to shove, they\u2019ve got each other\u2019s back. It was really sweet and pays a good amount of tribute to their original rivalry from the games.\nChris Pratt Was Actually Really Good\nSo yeah, after months of complaining, Chris Pratt was actually pretty solid as Mario. He has a good range of emotions, being able to play and straight man among all the strange happenings around him yet also able to pull off the Mario voice when he\u2019s excited, sounding far more like the character we all know and love.\nThe vast majority of the main cast do a good job of replicating the characters based on their voices in the games but with full dialogue. Charlie Day sounds like Luigi, Keegan-Michael Key sounds like Toad, and while Anya Tailor-Joy doesn\u2019t sound exactly like Princess Peach she\u2019s able to give the character a good amount of energy that works alongside Mario.\nThe true superstar of the show is Jack Black as Bowser. He may not have won Peach\u2019s heart but he certainly won mine. Black puts so much work into Bowser, giving him a distinctly devious attitude you\u2019d expect of a tyrant yet also knowing when to hold back and show his more silly or sensitive side. He\u2019s an absolute pleasure to watch on screen and the fact that they let him perform a full-on Tenacious D score really seals the deal.\nThe only problem I have with Bowser is that despite being part of the most well-known archenemies in gaming, he and Mario, once again, barely interact. Sure they fight each other a lot but they exchange around two lines of dialogue. I dunno, I just feel like the first meeting of all these iconic characters should have a little more weight to it.\nThe Super Mario Bros Movie\nThe Super Mario Bros movie is a good time with a bit of missed potential. If the movie just had an extra thirty or so minutes to iron out the character development and dialogue, it would be a bonafide star. I love these characters and I just wish we got to see their personalities play off each other more outside of fighting.\nThis however shouldn\u2019t take away from the success of the movie. This is the first time I can honestly say that an Illumination movie looked beautiful. I love how they recreated the Mushroom Kingdom and the confidence in exploring this new world. It\u2019s a video game movie that wears its heritage on its sleeve and I highly respect it for that.\nOverall, Super Mario Bros the movie is a fun time. There\u2019s a lot that can be improved on but I\u2019m glad it\u2019s become as successful as it has. There\u2019s plenty of room to explore the Mario universe in the cinema, and this is a good start, just maybe give the characters a bit more breathing room from World 2.\nmario movie score\n|Pros||Cons|\n|The confidence in the Mario world is respectable||The pacing is pretty bad|\n|The action scenes are stunning||Because the pacing is bad, the character development feels very disjointed|\n|Jack Black as Bowser stole the show||The second Mario brother is barely in the movie|\nThe Super Mario Bros.

        "text": "The Super Mario Bros. Movie\n2023, PG, 92 min. Directed by Aaron Horvath, Michael Jelenic. Voices by Chris Pratt, Anya Taylor-Joy, Charlie Day, Jack Black, Keegan-Michael Key, Seth Rogen, Fred Armisen.\nREVIEWED By Kimberley Jones, Fri., April 7, 2023\nAn everyman hero, voiced by the universally liked Chris Pratt, goes on a quest, discovering along the way hidden depths within himself and surprising the audience with how soulful and inventive animated entertainment based on a kids game can be.\nThere are a lot of reasons to be nostalgic for 2014, and one of them was how The LEGO\u00ae Movie defied its seemingly cynical origins (there\u2019s a registered trademark in its title, ffs) to prove a four-quadrant blockbuster could also be funny and startlingly weird and sincerely heartfelt. Despite sharing more than superficial similarities, The Super Mario Bros. Movie ticks exactly zero of those boxes.\nAudiences will probably still show up, lured by a well-loved intellectual property (the Nintendo franchise that first saw life in 1983 as an arcade game) and thirsty for a family film (the last major studio theatrical picture was December\u2019s zippy Puss in Boots: The Last Wish). With Hollywood in high panic over declining box office, every film released in theatres becomes a kind of referendum on the moviegoing experience. The Super Mario Bros. Movie, alas, feels like a straight-to-DVD release \u2013 dull and derivative.\nPratt and Day voice titular brothers Mario and Luigi, two Brooklyn plumbers who accidentally get sucked into another realm and are separated. Luigi lands in Dark Land (full of jump scares and skeletal Koopas that might be too spooky for younger viewers), while Mario touches down in Mushroom Kingdom. In the quest to save his brother, Mario connects with Princess Peach (Taylor-Joy), Toad (Key), and Donkey Kong (Rogen, one of the few semi-reliable sources of humor) to defeat the nefarious Bowser, voiced by Jack Black as a Meat Loaf-like crooner with designs on Peach.\nWorking from a script by Matthew Fogel (The LEGO Movie 2: The Second Part, Minions: The Rise of Gru), Teen Titans Go! creators Aaron Horvath and Michael Jelenic faithfully re-create characters, worlds, and gameplay from the first NES title and its many spinoffs. But to what end? Whatever invention there is here, it\u2019s baked into the DNA. And whatever fan-service thrills we might get from seeing those familiar pneumatic pipes and Bullet Bills retrofitted for the big screen fall away fast when there\u2019s nothing else to prop the thing up: not a compelling story or especially interesting voice performances or a single original idea. And when there\u2019s nothing to emotionally invest in, then all that\u2019s left is the nagging feeling you\u2019d rather just be playing the damn game. Because, really, there\u2019s only one scenario in which it\u2019s pleasurable to passively watch someone else navigate the Rainbow Road, and that\u2019s in a dorm room after generous bong rips.\nThis isn\u2019t the first attempt to draw blood from stone when it comes to this particular Nintendo property. A nightmare-inducing live-action attempt starring Bob Hoskins and John Leguizamo famously flopped 30 years ago. But in going to such great lengths to avoid that film\u2019s grim weirdness, The Super Mario Bros. Movie filmmakers have flattened the concept into benign nothingness. They\u2019ve course-corrected into the side of a mountain. There\u2019s no heartbeat here.\nAlamo Drafthouse Lakeline\n14028 Hwy. 183 N., 512/861-7070, www.drafthouse.com/austin/theater/lakeline\nMon., April 24\nTue., April 25\nWed., April 26\nAlamo Drafthouse Mueller\n1911 Aldrich #120, 512/572-1425, drafthouse.com/austin/theater/mueller\nMon., April 24\nTue., April 25\nWed., April 26\nAlamo Drafthouse Slaughter Lane\n5701 W.

        "text": "The fact that it has taken this long to make a modern animated Mario movie is, quite frankly, mindboggling to me. Mario is one of the biggest names in all of gaming, one that is recognized worldwide, even by people who have never picked up a controller in their lives. It has been worth the wait, though, because The Super Mario Bros is pretty much everything I wanted from a Mario movie: it\u2019s bright, cheerful, funny and chock full of references.\nThe movie opens by bringing everybody up to speed with the origin of the Mario Bros which tends to get forgotten about these days. The brothers are indeed plumbers from Brooklyn, and having just quit their steady job to open up their own business, they decide to film an advert where they both use an exaggerated Italian accent. Why? Well, because they come from an Italian family but because they live in Brooklyn they don\u2019t really have the accent. Oh, and it provides Chris Pratt (Mario) and Charlie Day (Luigi) an excuse to speak normally rather than offending the entirety of Italy.\nAnyway, while attempting to fix a catastrophic leak threatening to flood Brooklyn, our heroes accidentally discover and get sucked into a classic Warp Pipe, whereupon poor Luigi gets transported to the Badlands and is quickly captured by Bowser (Jack Black). Meanwhile, Mario winds up in the Mushroom Kingdom where he bumps into Toad who takes him to Princess Peach (Anya Taylor Joy).\nThe premise is simple: Mario needs to work with Princess Peach to fend off Bowser\u2019s steady advance toward the Mushroom Kingdom, allying with the Kongs along the way, all to save his brother. So, no pressure, yeah?\nA lot of critics claimed that The Super Marios Bros. Movie has a paper-thin plot. They are right. This is not a complex movie full of deep themes or layered characters, and that\u2019s okay. Mario games are not known for their plot, and while animated movies like Puss in Boots: The Last Wish can tackle big ideas, I have no issue with a Mario movie keeping things straightforward and simple. It wants to be a good time for kids and adults alike, for both fans and non-fans.\nI\u2019m also fine with the lack of explanations for a lot of what is going on. The movie doesn\u2019t try to justify the existence of power-ups or the Mushroom Kingdom, it just asks you to accept them at face value as part of the universe. Your world has plants that get you high? Awesome! Well, we in the Mushroom Kingdom have flowers that let you throw fireballs. Same, same.\nClocking in at 1hr 32m, The Super Mario Bros. Movie is a fast-paced ride that nevertheless feels like it gives you enough time to just hang out with the characters and establish everyone\u2019s motivations. It packs a lot into that short runtime: dozens of characters, various locations, heaps of word details like floating platforms and loads more. I\u2019m a little unsure if a non-Mario fan will be able to keep up with it all. A sequel, which is going to be inevitable considering the box office numbers, will hopefully be a little more focused now that Illumination has given us a speedrun of all things Mario.\nIt feels like the first half of the movie focuses more on delivering the laughs, from the slapstick comedy of Mario trying to hone his platforming skills to a cheerfully depressed Lumalee hanging out in Bowser\u2019s dungeon. I was honestly surprised by how many smirks, chuckles and even full-on laughs the film managed to tease out of me, my older brother and my two nieces who are 9 and 14. That\u2019s a solid indication of a good family movie right there. The second half amps up the action, delivering a bunch of cool sequences, though the comedy element is still firmly entrenched in everything.\nI have to say, I feel like splitting up Mario and Luigi was a mistake. The time they spend together in Brooklyn before being sucked into another world is excellent because their dynamic is so much fun and their love for each other shines through. By splitting them up, the movie takes that fun dynamic away and it goes from being The Super Mario Bros Movie to just The Mario Movie for a while. With that said, I do think this could be a fun test for a Luigi\u2019s Mansion movie which has been strongly hinted at. The creepy Dry Bones, the crumbling mansion and the foreboding landscape all point heavily towards the spooky vibe of Luigi\u2019s Mansion. Charlie Day does a stellar job of capturing Luigi\u2019s big heart and his timid nature, so I\u2019d be hyped to get a full movie where Day can display Luigi\u2019s courage in the face of the supernatural, especially without his brother backing him up. Honestly, I\u2019d be fine with a pretty straight adaption of Luigi\u2019s Mansion 3.\nAlright, so let\u2019s tackle the big issue, shall we? A lot of people, myself included, were not convinced about having Chris Pratt as the voice of Mario, especially after the first trailer. Not because he isn\u2019t a good actor \u2013 the man has put out loads of great work, after all. No, the fears stemmed from the fact that the trailers made him sound like\u2026well, like Chris Pratt and not Mario. These concerns were largely unfounded. Sure, he isn\u2019t doing the typical Mario voice but he still puts on a good performance and does occasionally get to yell out some classic lines. He does a good job of playing Mario as brave, devoted to his brother and completely unable to stay down no matter what hits him. He\u2019s tenacious, loyal, funny and determined to chase his dream of a Super Mario Bros business.\nAnya Tailor Joy takes on the role of Princess Peach, the leader of the Mushroom. Over the years people have developed an image of Princess Peach being little more than a damsel in distress but while that is certainly true in some cases, in others she\u2019s an ass-kicking machine, appearing as a fully playable character across numerous adventures, including starring in her own games. Here, she gets to teach Mario the ropes on a classic floating obstacle course and has some awesome moments. She does come off as perhaps being a little too perfect, fitting in with the modern trend of trying to portray women as being strong by turning them into flawless people, but Anya does a job of keeping her grounded. The movie also sets up nicely for future Peach stories.\nJack Black is the voice of the monstrous Bowser and not only does he do a superb job of being both funny and threatening, but he also sounds like he\u2019s having a freaking blast in the role. He\u2019s giving it his all and even gets to belt out a few songs where Bowser pines after Princess Peach. Bowser really is a scene-stealer, though it\u2019s a shame we never get much in the way of background for him. Why is he so intent on taking over the kingdoms, and why is he so infatuated with Peach? In that regard, he\u2019s not a hugely compelling villain, but it doesn\u2019t stop him from being a lot of fun.\nOf all the actors and actresses, it\u2019s Seth Rogan\u2019s Donkey Kong that feels the weakest. He doesn\u2019t affect any kind of voice for the role, nor does he have any kind of Donkey Kong mannerisms. It\u2019s not a bad performance, but it\u2019s very clearly just Seth Rogan as a monkey.\nIt feels like I could have paused the movie at almost any point and found at least a couple of references and nods to Mario\u2019s past. Some are more obvious than others, like a hugely entertaining Mario Kart section that takes place on Rainbow Road, and others are far more subtle, like a piece of music that harkens back to a classic adventure. It\u2019s clear that the entire team who worked on the movie has a lot of respect for the franchise and wanted the project to be a love letter to all things Mario, including getting the actual voice of Mario (Charles Martinet) as a cameo.\nIs it maybe a little too stuffed with references? Eh, maybe. But it didn\u2019t bother me.\nVisually, the movie is gorgeous to look at. Although it does play it safe compared to more adventurous films like Into the Spider-Verse, the animation quality is superb. And damn, is it colourful! I\u2019m really looking forward to seeing this one on my TV with full HDR because the colours should practically explode off of the screen like a crazed terrorist bombing.\nWhile I don\u2019t think The Super Mario Bros. Movie is up in the highest echelons of animated movies, it is still an extremely fun film. It\u2019s a wonderfully animated journey that does justice to Mario and Luigi, setting them both up for future adventures, as well as an expansive Nintendo movieverse. There\u2019s plenty of fun action, a lot of genuinely funny jokes and slapstick, an absurd amount of references and an obvious adoration for not just the Mario Bros, but for their fans as well.",

Nearby, a Mushroom Kingdom, ruled by the indomitable Princess Peach (voice of Anya Taylor-Joy), prepares for what they believe to be an impending attack. \n Meanwhile, back in Brooklyn, Mario (voice of Chris Pratt) and his brother Luigi (voice of Charlie Day) have left their steady jobs at a reliable plumbing company to start a plumbing business of their own. Their first contract doesn\u2019t go according to plan and Mario is feeling downhearted, until he sees a news broadcast depicting inept plumbers attempting to fix the city\u2019s critical plumbing problems. Knowing he can help, Mario and Luigi set off to save their neighbourhood. They find themselves deep under the city in a cavernous room filled with unusual pipes and when Luigi suddenly vanishes, Mario ventures after him. The brothers are sucked into another world and separated on the journey: Luigi lands in the dangerous Badlands under Bowser\u2019s control, where he is quickly captured; and Mario lands in a Mushroom Kingdom where he learns about the danger his brother is in and sets about trying to save him. Mario impresses the princess with his determination and noble character, and she agrees to take him with her to meet a Cranky Kong (voice of Fred Armisen) whose powerful son, Donkey Kong (voice of Seth Rogan), and vast Gorilla army is their only hope of winning the fight against Bowser, stopping his evil plan and saving Luigi, as well as everyone else captured along the way. \n \n Themes info \n \n \n Children and adolescents may react adversely at different ages to themes of crime, suicide, drug and alcohol dependence, death, serious illness, family breakdown, death or separation from a parent, animal distress or cruelty to animals, children as victims, natural disasters and racism. Occasionally reviews may also signal themes that some parents may simply wish to know about. \n \n \n \n Separation from family members; Greed for power; Bullying. \n \n Use of violence info \n \n \n Research shows that children are at risk of learning that violence is an acceptable means of conflict resolution when violence is glamourised, performed by an attractive hero, successful, has few real life consequences, is set in a comic context and / or is mostly perpetrated by male characters with female victims, or by one race against another. \n Repeated exposure to violent content can reinforce the message that violence is an acceptable means of conflict resolution. Repeated exposure also increases the risks that children will become desensitised to the use of violence in real life or develop an exaggerated view about the prevalence and likelihood of violence in their own world. \n \n \n \n There is some violence in this movie, including: \n \n Lava blasts fall to the earth as a penguin colony is attacked by Bowser\u2019s army. He tells them to: \u201cOpen the gates or die\u201d. \n The penguins fight back, attacking the turtle creatures with snowballs. \n Bowser lifts the penguins up, as if by magic, and throws them all aside. He then burns their castle to the ground, imprisons the penguins and steals a powerful star. \n A character has a napkin rudely thrown in his face. \n A character grabs Mario, lifts him up by the overalls and throws him on the ground. \n A cat attacks Luigi in the face. \n A woman is accidentally knocked over. \n A violent dog attacks the brothers. \n A character attacks Mario with a stick. \n Mushroom guards chase Mario and attack him as he attempts to meet with Princess Peach. \n There is repeated mention of ritualistic sacrifice. \n Mario punches himself in the face. \n Mario repeatedly smashes into things, falls off objects, is blasted with water, bitten by plants and is punched, smashed and hit, as he attempts to complete an obstacle course. \n Bowser says he will destroy the Mushroom Kingdom if Princess Peach refuses to marry him. \n A bully knocks a young Luigi down and smashes the Lego castle he is building. Young Mario shoves the bully aside and helps his brother. \n A small turtle has his fingers crushed in a piano. \n Bowser tortures Luigi and tries to rip off his moustache. \n A creepy, child-like voice calls out in the prison abyss that: \u201cThere is no hope. NO escape. Only the sweet relief of death\u201d. \n A car slips on a banana peel, spins out of control, crashes, and explodes. \n Donkey Kong tells Mario: \u201cI am going to break every bone in your body\u201d. \n Mario and Donkey Kong fight. Mario is slapped, punched, bashed, and hit repeatedly. He is shown battered and bruised but he doesn\u2019t give up. \n Mario slashes Donkey Kong\u2019s face and hits him with a barrel, knocking him unconscious. \n Princess Peach blasts Bowser with cold and freezes him into a cube of ice. \n The Gorilla army is attacked by Bowser. They shoot bananas while the Turtle army tries to blast characters out of the way. \n Mario and his race cart are nearly crushed. \n Mario knocks a turtle out of its vehicle. \n Donkey Kong and Mario are blasted off a rainbow bridge. They fall into the water where Donkey Kong is hit on the head by a giant wheel and knocked unconscious. Mario saves him just as he is about to be eaten by a sea monster. \n Moments later the monster raises up to the surface and eats both Mario and Donkey Kong. \n Bowser threatens and tortures a Mushroom inhabitant in order to force the princess to agree to marry him. \n Mario and Donkey Kong use a cannon blaster to blast themselves out of the sea monster. \n Bowser attempts to burn his prisoners alive by lowering them into a lava pit. \n Arrows are shot at characters. \n Luigi is about to be burned alive. He is falling into the lava when Mario rescues him. \n Princess Peach is blasted aside and Bowser launches a missile to destroy the Mushroom Kingdom. \n The missile chases Mario and tries to explode everything in his wake. \n Mario is blasted back to Brooklyn, along with the others, and numerous characters are nearly crushed by falling debris. \n Bowser punches Mario; knocks him into a car; tries to burn and crush him; and knocks him into a wall. He is injured but doesn\u2019t stop fighting. \n Bowser hits Donkey Kong and is about to claw him when Mario and Luigi power up and punch Bowser through an army of his turtles. They hit, slam, punch, throw, and flip him until there is hardly anything left of Bowser. \n \n Material that may scare or disturb children \n \n Under five info \n \n \n Children under five are most likely to be frightened by scary visual images, such as monsters, physical transformations. \n \n \n \n In addition to the above-mentioned violent scenes, there are some scenes in this movie that could scare or disturb children under the age of five, including the following: \n \n The opening images of Bowser\u2019s army descending on the penguin kingdom, his ship filled with molten rock, its enormous horns and evil, glowing eyes as it launches its attack, may be upsetting for some very young viewers. \n There is a creepy-looking sea monster that rises from the deep to eat Mario and Donkey Kong. The pair are able to get out eventually, but some children may be frightened by the sudden intensity of the scene. \n \n \n Aged five to eight info \n \n \n Children aged five to eight will also be frightened by scary visual images and will also be disturbed by depictions of the death of a parent, a child abandoned or separated from parents, children or animals being hurt or threatened and / or natural disasters. \n \n \n \n In addition to the above-mentioned violent scenes and scary visual images, there are some scenes in this movie that could scare or disturb children aged five to eight, including the following: \n \n Shortly after arriving in Bowser\u2019s lands, Luigi is chased by zombie-like, skeletal creatures with red glowing eyes. Luigi is terrified as they come after him, clawing their way out of the ground and chasing him through a dark and deadly forest. More and more creatures join the chase, trying to get Luigi to fall into the lava river, grabbing at him and snatching at his face. He just barely manages to escape into a haunted-looking house and he bolts the door behind him. As he struggles to catch his breath, creepy, ghost-like creatures, with masks (like something out of a horror film), suddenly appear out of the darkness behind him. They look menacing and scary, and Luigi is screaming as the scene fades to darkness. He is later shown as a prisoner and Bowser talks about using him as a sacrifice. \n \n \n Aged eight to thirteen info \n \n \n Children aged eight to thirteen are most likely to be frightened by realistic threats and dangers, violence or threat of violence and / or stories in which children are hurt or threatened. \n \n \n \n \n Nothing further of concern. \n \n Product placement \n The following products are displayed or used in this movie: \n \n The entire movie showcases aspects of the Mario/Nintendo games. \n \n Sexual references \n There are some sexual references in this movie, including: \n \n Bowser wants to marry Princess Peach; he describes how she is physically attractive to him and he is very jealous of Mario. \n Mario briefly flirts with Princess Peach and another character teases him that she would never go out with him. \n \n Nudity and sexual activity \n \n None noted. \n \n Use of substances \n There is some use of substances in this movie, including: \n \n Mario eats magic mushrooms that give him extraordinary, yet short lived, super strength. \n \n Coarse language \n There is some coarse language in this movie, including: \n \n Idiot \n Dumb \n Stupid \n Worthless \n Shut up \n Lunatic \n Psycho \n \u201cYou\u2019re a joke and you always will be\u201d. \n \n In a nutshell \n The Super Mario Bros. Movie  is a film based on the popular Nintendo videogame franchise. The plot, though predictable, is fast-paced and contains numerous twists and turns.

        "text": "Super Mario Bros. Movie review - an entertaining advert for everything Nintendo\nBowser's story inside.\nIt's taken 30 years, but Nintendo finally has a Super Mario Bros. movie to please the masses. As a life-long Nintendo fan, I still can't quite believe it exists - even seeing photos of Shigeru Miyamoto rubbing shoulders with Chris Pratt on the Hollywood red carpet this week felt like a bizarre collision of galaxies - and yet in this age of Sonic the Hedgehog film sequels and Mushroom Kingdom theme parks, it's simultaneously odd it has taken this long. Here we are then, with 90 minutes of bright and breezy fare bringing Mario and the gang to the big screen in an adventure which is all-action and wafer-thin on plot - just like most Mario games! - albeit with a few tantalising hints at character development buried between the constant cameos and continual laughs.\nAside from those cameos, it's almost impossible to spoil the Super Mario Bros. Movie's story, such that it is. Mario is the everyman from New York, a do-good plumber with an extended pasta-eating Italian family and little brother Luigi who he's always looked out for. The film spends longer than expected setting up Mario's Brooklyn background (accompanied by a couple of nice voice cameos from original Mario voice actor Charles Martinet), though never dares sit still for too long. Amidst several plumbing and platforming action sequences, the movie finds time to smartly acknowledge Mario's new Chris Pratt accent (which quickly settles on the ear) and hand-wave the practicalities of a plumber in pristine white gloves. Quickly, however, both brothers end up magically sucked into the Mushroom Kingdom, leaving them separated and placed on two very different paths.\nThe rest of the film plays out very much as you might expect, with the introduction of familiar faces like Princess Peach (a determined-sounding Anya Taylor-Joy), benevolent protector of the rather Minions-like Toads, here given enough agency to also be on her own quest: to save her realm from the invading Bowser. Joining them are Toad himself (an endearingly enthusiastic Keegan Michael-Key) and the swaggering Donkey Kong (literally just Seth Rogen). Luigi (Charlie Day) is left with a more minor role, though ultimately is given his moments to shine. The true star of the film though, by far, is the typically ebullient Jack Black as Bowser, who gets plenty of screen time as well as a family friendly Tenacious D-esque musical number, which perfectly encapsulates his comically menacing ambitions on power and expectations of Peach somehow becoming his bride.\nThe set-up of a sort-of love triangle between Mario, Peach and Bowser is the basis for some of the film's few real character moments, as Mario and Peach become better acquainted and get a few chances to reflect together on their individual backgrounds. Somewhat frustratingly, though, any real relationship-building is often cut short by the film's need to quickly cut to a gag for younger audiences, or what feels like a desire to save story threads for inevitable sequels. Of course, Mario games have never hinged on his home life, while Peach's own family has only had the vaguest of hints - which, bar one intriguing tease, is also about all we get here. Yes, it would have felt too odd for the Mario movie to suddenly offer some kind of canon-changing revelation, or a \"we were all Mario all along\"-style third wall-break akin to The Lego Movie. But for vast stretches of this film, where the characters do talk and interact in a way that's unlike most Mario games, little of substance is actually said, which is a shame.\nDespite all that, though, the Super Mario Bros. Movie still ultimately succeeds. What moments we are given with Mario and Luigi, both as brothers and together as part of their initially stern family, end up servicing a predictable if no-less-thrilling finale, and an entertaining third act that has largely not already been served up in trailers and sneak peeks. The Mushroom Kingdom has truly never looked any better thanks to the technical wizardry of Despicable Me creators Illumination, or sounded any finer thanks to gorgeous orchestral reimaginings from 30 years of Mario video game history, brought to life here once again by the legendary composer Koji Kondo. And while the plot may be thin, the laughs are pretty constant, with several brilliant turns by secondary characters such as Bowser's masochistic sidekick Kamek, as well as the abruptly dark humour of the childlike Lumalee.\nIf you've played any Mario game (especially Mario Kart) in the past 30 years, you'll feel the warm glow of familiarity from the film's never-ending nods, references and Easter eggs to Nintendo lore - though, crucially, no prior knowledge ever felt necessary to understand what was happening on screen. Mostly I was surprised how well much of it transferred over as-is, including some smart side-scrolling action sequences and an explosive journey along Rainbow Road, plus some trickier-to-translate elements of Mario gameplay such as power-ups, which are kept largely accurate to their in-game selves.\nIt's been over five years since Nintendo announced its initial partnership with Universal to recreate elements of the Mario franchise in its theme parks worldwide. And while I haven't travelled to Universal Studios in Japan or Hollywood yet, watching the Super Mario Bros. Movie feels a little bit like I spent an hour or so there. It's no coincidence that parts of this film's Mushroom Kingdom look identical to the ones you can now travel to and wander around in real-life, nor that the movie's second act takes place largely in the Kong Kingdom, the next theme park area to open in Japan in 2024. And yes, I left the film ready to ditch London's grey streets and hop back into the Mushroom Kingdom myself in video game form. The Super Mario Bros. Movie is one massive advert for Nintendo's mascot and for the company's games in general - and a safe first step for what feels like a galaxy of sequels and spin-offs to follow.\nWe've come a long way from Bowser's brief cameo in Wreck-It Ralph, when Nintendo famously gave notes on the correct way for Disney's animators to show Bowser holding a teacup. Illumination's version of this world, made hand-in-white-glove with Miyamoto himself, undoubtedly allows for more freedom - though, perhaps unusually for Miyamoto, steadfastly refuses to upset the tea table itself. Perhaps Nintendo's caution is understandable, considering the last time Mario appeared on cinema screens. Three decades on, this film arrives as part of a vastly different era of Mario, albeit with Nintendo's mascot as entertaining as ever.",

        "text": "The Super Mario Bros. Movie review: Is it worth seeing?\nIs The Super Mario Bros. Movie worth seeing? What can you expect from it? Let\u2019s find out.\nThe fight for the beloved Mushroom Kingdom is finally here as the long-awaited return of Mario and Luigi to the big screen has arrived. (Spoilers ahead for those who haven\u2019t seen the film yet.)\nOne thing that fans of any game that comes from the Mario property can be assured of is that the plot is always straightforward and an easy yet enjoyable time. The Super Mario Bros. Movie is no different as the plot is laid out in an unconvoluted manner.\nThe Super Mario Bros. Movie review\nBowser wants Princess Peach\u2019s hand in marriage and will take over the world to do so. At the start of the film Mario and Luigi are two bumbling plumbers struggling to start their own business before they\u2019re whisked away to the Mushroom Kingdom which looks and feels exactly like the one fans of the games have come to love. Everything in this universe has the exact feel of the games and offers a lot of Easter eggs and callbacks.\nThey have question mark boxes that unveil items, brick blocks begging to be smashed, and even toads harvesting coins. Bowser himself has collected a star which he plans to use to sweep the Princess off her feet in a grand gesture of marriage. The overall plot is simple but, the way that they manage to weave aspects of the various games is a rather clever way to advance the plot forward. We get the thrill of racing karts and dropping the dreaded bananas, a call back to Luigi\u2019s Haunted Mansion, and even a map resembling that from Super Mario the game.\nOne thing that goes underrated about this film is the soundtrack. Throughout the film fans are treated to the classic Mario tunes we are used to hearing as we die repeatedly thanks to that stupid Koopa. Moreover, the cast themselves do a wonderful job. A big worry going into the film was how Chris Pratt would portray the classic Mario voice and while it isn\u2019t the one we know, he and Charlie Day do a fantastic job putting their own Brooklyn spin on it.\nAll in all, if you grew up loving the franchise then this film is made for you. It\u2019s a wonderfully enjoyable adventure full of heart with nods to its origins while putting its own spin on things. Be sure to stay after the credits as there are two post-credit scenes \u2013 one of which is important to the future of Super Mario films. Grab some popcorn and relax and enjoy the adventure.\nAre you going to see The Super Mario Bros. Movie in movie theaters? Let us know in the comments below!",

        "text": "\"The Super Mario Bros. Movie,\" with its vistas of primary colors, is here to brighten our dreary springs, T.S. Eliot be damned. That there is a swell of enthusiasm for a Mario Bros. movie is a once-unthinkable development. The last time Mario hit the big screen was in the little-remembered 1993 live-action film with Bob Hoskins as Mario, John Leguizamo as Luigi and Dennis Hopper(!) as Bowser. Hoskins called the experience \"a f--- nightmare.\"\nBut a lot has changed in the three decades since \"Super Mario Bros,\" the very first video-game adaptation. A once widely derided genre is now a cash cow. \"The Last of Us\" is a massive success on HBO. Pokemon and \"Uncharted\" are box-office hits. With Sonic the Hedgehog already two movies in, Mario is playing catch up.\nAnd \"The Super Mario Bros. Movie,\" which opens in theaters Wednesday, is a spirited and sprightly attempt to race to the front of the pack. A collaboration between legendary video-game designer and Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto and Illumination founder Chris Meledandri (both producers), it's a drastically more sincere effort to capture the fun and spirit of the Nintendo game.\nAnd visually, it's a dream. Directors Aaron Horvath and Michael Jelenic and their animators have rendered the Mario universe with cartoony splendor, matching the game's ingenious simplicity with a more robust and equally delightful day-glo palate. If part of the appeal of playing \"Super Mario Bros.\" and its many offshoots has always been to be immersed in such a sunny imaginary world - plus the bouncy earworm compositions of composer Koji Kondo - the movie has successfully mirrored that mushroom-stomping pleasure. It makes you ... want to play Mario.\nThat's because as nice as it is to look at \"The Super Mario Bros. Movie,\" it's not anywhere near as fun as it would be to play it. It's a-him, Mario, but it's no a-masterpiece. The storyline is only a touch above the interstitial bits of plot you usually get between gameplay. With the exception of Jack Black's grandly lovesick Bowser (he's part Phantom of the Opera, part Meatloaf-styled balladeer), there's nothing here that deepens these characters beyond their usual 2-D adventures. Mario may be a modern-day Mickey Mouse but his kingdom is on the console.\n\"The Super Mario Bros. Movie\" begins much like Spike Lee's \"Do the Right Thing\": in a Brooklyn pizza parlor. There Mario (Chris Pratt, passable despite the outcry) and Luigi (Charlie Day) are struggling to get their plumbing business off the ground. There are a few moments of stereotypical Italian life - pasta and a big family dinner - before the brothers' attempt to fix a water main break drops them through a portal and into the fantasy realm of the game. (In future Brooklyn-set sequels, Mario will presumably combat waves of strollers and hipsters.)\nOn the other side, Bowser lords over a Koopa Troop army in scenes that can feel like the most surreal imitation yet of \"Triumph of the Will.\" But while shrinking or enlarging are possible on this other side of the green pipe, there's never any mention of the possibility of lives being lost as Mario makes his way through mushroom patches and question-mark boxes. His predicament is just as clear as in the game: He's been separated from Luigi and he must help save Princess Peach (Anya Taylor-Joy) from being forced to wed Bowser.\nGame logic often dictates Mario's movements. The shells of the turtle-like Koopas can be slid around like ammo. And choosing a Mario Kart vehicle is just as difficult a decision. Sometimes, the overlis less consistent. An invincibility star is the most sought-after item in this adventure, greatly exaggerating its typical usefulness. Those things last for like 10 seconds.\nNone of this is likely to be enough for anyone to exclaim \"Oh, yeah!\" while hopping up and down and doffing their cap. But it is an hour and a half's worth of superlative marketing that will whet your appetite for more Mario back home on the couch. If anything, the - as Mario would say - \"okey dokey\" \"Super Mario Bros. Movie\" only reinforces the distance between two wholly different mediums. It may be game-on for video-game adaptations but the Mario main event is still back on Nintendo.\n\"The Super Mario Bros. Movie,\" a Universal Pictures release, is rated PG by the Motion Picture Association for action and mild violence. Running time: 92 minutes.

        "text": "The first ever live-action film adaptation of a video game was 1993\u2019s Super Mario Bros, starring Bob Hoskins and John Leguizamo. Dark and smirkingly edgy in a sub-Ghostbusters, whiff-of-desperation way, and bearing almost no resemblance to the calypso-scored, sugar-hued Nintendo franchise on which it was based, it is now widely \u2013 and not unreasonably \u2013 regarded as one of the worst motion pictures ever made.\nEven so, I\u2019d watch that fascinating failure again in a heartbeat over this new animated version from the Minions studio Illumination, which is as shallow, sterile and eyeball-drillingly inane a feature-length brand-extension exercise as Hollywood has yet produced. Goodness knows the two recent Sonic the Hedgehog films felt like vacuous cash-ins; Super Mario Bros makes them look like Raiders of the Lost Ark.\nThe story opens in bizarrely similar fashion to the 1993 version, with the plumber siblings, voiced by Chris Pratt and Charlie Day, being whisked through a magical portal from present-day Brooklyn to the fairy tale video-game world, which Jack Black\u2019s Bowser and his Koopa Troopa legions are about to invade. First, however, there are around 10 minutes of actual plumbing to sit through, as the brothers unfunnily destroy a luxurious bathroom while being menaced by its owner\u2019s dog.\nThis job comes their way thanks to a home-made advert screening on local TV channels. \u201cThis is not a commercial \u2013 this is cinema!\u201d Luigi (Day) enthuses: the kind of line critics sometimes call a free hit. This early material feels like offcuts from an old Minions project, down to an extended family dinner which warmly if aimlessly sends up this staple scene in Italian-American immigrant epics. But at least it\u2019s vaguely unexpected compared to what follows.\nFrom here, the plot is nothing but crumbs. Mario and a disturbingly botoxed Princess Peach (Anya Taylor-Joy) must hike to the Jungle Kingdom to retrieve Donkey Kong (Seth Rogen) before prising the now-captured Luigi from Bowser\u2019s clutches. But the journey isn\u2019t an adventure so much as a CG walking tour of brand assets \u2013 items, environments, sound effects, music cues, and so on \u2013 drawn from 38 years of Mario games.\nDoes it do anything entertaining or imaginative with these recognisable objects? Well, no. Just recreating them in (surprisingly second-rate) CG while shouting \u2018remember this?\u2019 is, moronically and relentlessly, all we get. And no fan-service gambit appears to have been deemed too wretched or shaming for consideration: among the more notable lows is a minute-long dramatisation of the vehicle selection menu from Mario Kart 8.\nSometimes an actual joke manages to wriggle under the fence, though most are variations on two or three threadbare themes. (\u201cBut I\u2019m too cute to [insert un-cute action here]!\u201d and characters gurning during slow-motion backflips are both instantly tedious staples.)\nAnd whenever an action sequence starts to feel like meaningless wheel-spinning, which is often, a 1980s pop standard is used to mushroom-boost it over the finish line. A sequence in which Mario, Peach and Toad are (inexplicably) driven through DK\u2019s Jungle Parkway by an anonymous, Miami Vice-styled gorilla to the strains of A-ha\u2019s Take on Me is of the film\u2019s mindless all-of-this-stuff-is-popular-right? approach. Despite some serious competition in recent years, no film has ever made me feel more like I was being frogmarched round a branch of Toys R Us.\nWill this monstrosity be a hit? Inevitably, it will: it\u2019s short, which means cinemas can programme lots of screenings; it has no direct competition as a family film until the release of The Little Mermaid remake in mid-May; and the Mario games themselves are inter-generationally beloved. For parents, especially, the damn thing will be unavoidable. But if a friend or relative should happen to whoop \u201clet\u2019s-a go\u201d, you may wish to gently counter \u2013 if you\u2019re in the fortunate position to be able to do so \u2013 actually, let\u2019s-a not.\nIn cinemas now",

Even Elon Musk tweeted that \"the critics are so disconnected from reality!\"\nCrowds \"didn't seem to care about so-so reviews\", the Hollywood Reporter's Pamela McClintock wrote.\nThe film broke other records, including the best-ever opening for a movie based on a video game and the top opening of 2023 so far, she said.\nComscore analyst Paul Dergarabedian told the outlet: \"This is one of the biggest box office over-performances in recent memory and is absolutely shattering all pre-release projections.\"\nPost-pandemic box office fears\nVariety agreed that the film \"crushed already-high expectations\", while Screen Daily said it \"pulled off a thunderous bow which shows the theatrical demand for family titles at a time when Hollywood executives are concerned about the depth of supply lines as the world emerges from the pandemic\".\nGlobal box office figures for 2022 were 35% down on pre-Covid levels.\nReflecting on Super Mario's takings, the New York Times asked: \"Are family movies back - all the way back, to the degree that Hollywood can once again count on them as relative sure things?\n\"Studio executives and movie theatre owners were practically doing cartwheels over the weekend while shouting, 'Yes!'\"",

Movie\nThe first animated feature based on the beloved video-game series is a bit of a letdown, but kids will be pleased.\nLet\u2019s not forget: This might\u2019ve been good.\nIt\u2019s not bad, exactly. It\u2019s okay. But \u201cThe Super Mario Bros. Movie\u201d is unambitious \u2014 fundamentally a movie for kids with easter eggs for longtime Nintendo devotees. It aims no higher than that. And the cynical thought would be clear: \u201cWell, what do you want? It\u2019s just a movie about Mario.\u201d\nBut it might\u2019ve been handled like \u201cThe LEGO Movie,\u201d which inserted genuine humor and formal experimentation to overcome its commercial origins. It might\u2019ve been approached the way Pixar has always approached the \u201cToy Story\u201d films, searching for realities about childhood and adolescence in an innocent story. It might\u2019ve even been approached like \u201cSpider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse,\u201d as an opportunity for innovative and memorable animation.\nIt doesn\u2019t cost any more to aim high, after all, but that evidently wasn\u2019t in the playbook.\nThirty years after the disastrous, live-action adaptation of the landmark video game, this version at least hews closer to the colorful, playful world of the video games. Mario (Chris Pratt, woefully miscast) and Luigi (Charlie Day, better) are trying to launch a plumbing business in Brooklyn when they\u2019re sucked into a subterranean pipe and deposited in a video-game world. (To be fair, Brooklyn is pretty gamified in this one, too.)\nLuigi is captured by Bowser (Jack Black, perfect), who\u2019s planning on using a power-up to conquer the Mushroom Kingdom. Mario lands in the vicinity of Toad (Keegan-Michael Key) and Princess Peach (Anya Taylor-Joy), who pursue the services of Donkey Kong (Seth Rogen) to defend the cuter inhabitants of this \u2014 kingdom? Universe? General game area, I guess \u2014 from Bowser\u2019s advancing army.\nThe film corrects the longtime wrong of the series by subbing Luigi for Peach. She\u2019s a dominant and confident warrior a la Wonder Woman, who actually trains Mario; he\u2019s a tentative yet loving brother who accidentally gets into a sticky situation. It removes the literal objectification of the non-Mario characters nicely and neatly.\nOther than hinting at some daddy issues with Mario (whose father is voiced by the longtime voice of the character, Charles Martinet) and Donkey Kong, that\u2019s about as far as \u201cThe Super Mario Bros. Movie\u201d goes with thoughtfulness. The rest is the standard-issue, point-to-point plot movements that have worked for studio Illumination in series such as \u201cDespicable Me\u201d and \u201cThe Secret Life of Pets.\u201d\nAccordingly, your kids will probably like this one; these flicks are machines calibrated to generate laughs out of the youth. If you\u2019re hoping for an experience that will unite the generations around a lovely piece of popcorn cinema, however \u2026 \u201cDungeons & Dragons\u201d is still playing.\nMy Rating: 5/10\n\u201cThe Super Mario Bros. Movie\u201d is now playing in theaters.",

        "text": "By and large, it\u2019s at least a solid movie, but it\u2019s hard to not feel immensely disappointed.\nIt moves insanely fast, sacrificing any ounce of storytelling in favor of Easter eggs, gags, and nostalgia. It\u2019s kind of shocking how little time the movie spends trying to make us care about these worlds or characters and it doesn\u2019t help that beside Jack Black (the easy MVP), everyone else seems to phone it in.\nBut even if it flounders at the basic foundation, it\u2019s still fun? Looks good, some of the jokes hit well, and I enjoyed a lot of the action sequences. There\u2019s a particular nihilistic side character that had me in stitches.\nAm I blinded by own adoration for the Mario Brothers franchise? Likely. But presumably that\u2019s going to be the case for 90% of the people who will see it this weekend.",

        "text": "If you\u2019re looking for a no spoilers Super Mario Bros Movie review, this is the one that will blue shell the living daylights out of the rest. Too long have we suffered under the glare or sour-faced critics and our take on Mario\u2019s big return to the big screen should steer you in the right direction.\nTo start with, there\u2019s the big question when you look at any movie and that\u2019s, is it worth spending all that cash on at the big screen. Our honest answer is a big yes to any Mario game fans, Nintendo lovers or animated movie buffs out there, because this is everything you will have wanted and more.\nDon\u2019t forget to follow us on Twitter to see news and updates on upcoming film releases. You can also see more on the film in the run up to the release with The Super Mario Bros Movie Twitter page at https://twitter.com/supermariomovie.\nStory, characters and pacing reviewAdvertisement\nThe general synopsis for the Super Mario Movie is that the two brothers find themselves in the Mushroom Kingdom just as Bowser is in the process of launching a major offensive. It\u2019s pretty close to the general story for most Mario games and there\u2019s more than enough of a journey to make it work well for the movie.\nIt does a pretty good job of developing the characters beyond the more superficial stories from the games, which gives the film more heart and emotional investment. In all fairness for old-school Mario fans it has us at \u201cIt\u2019s a me\u201d, but for more general viewers the additional details will definitely make it more appealing.\nRELATED: Super Mario Bros Movie post credits scene explained\nThere are plenty of twists and turns along the way, so it\u2019s not just a case of going from A to B without much in between. It also combines action with adventure, comedy and a little drama to give the story a well balanced finish that will leave you hoping for more Mario movies in the future.\nOur only criticism is that it could have taken it\u2019s time a little more and added in additional content to make some of the sequences more interesting and develop more of the side characters a little further. It comes together in the end, but it\u2019s a bit of a blur at times, but then that\u2019s going to result in a lot of home media re-watches when it comes out on DVD, Blu-ray and digital later in the year.\nCast reviewAdvertisement\nWhen the Super Mario Movie cast was first announced it picked up a lot of flack online with Chris Pratt in the lead role and other big stars like Seth Rogan and Jack Black in the mix. In all fairness the trailers have already confirmed that the fears were unfounded, but when you\u2019re watching the film itself you only really see the characters.\nThis is especially true of Chris Pratt who is pretty much pitch perfect throughout the film and it\u2019s a similar story for Anya Taylor-Joy as Princess Peach, Charlie Day as Luigi and Keegan-Michael Key as Toad. Seth Rogan is always going to be Seth Rogan in anything he does, but it kind of works for his part as Donkey Kong.\nAs with any film like this, a lot of the weighting comes down to the success of the villain to deliver the goods and the good news is that Jack Black does a solid job as Bowser. He\u2019s got such a recognizable voice that it\u2019s impossible not to think of him whenever Bowser goes into full growl mode, but he\u2019s definitely the best man for the part.\nThe only minor question mark we have in terms of our cast review for the Mario Movie is that Cranky Cong sounds a little off. He\u2019s played by Fred Armisan and he just doesn\u2019t sound Cranky enough if we\u2019re being critical, but it really doesn\u2019t change much for the film overall.\nRELATED: Super Mario Bros Movie rent online release date latest\nVisual impactAdvertisement\nIf you didn\u2019t already get it from the trailer, the visual impact of the Mario Movie is off the charts. It\u2019s been crafted to the nth degree to deliver a real big screen adventure into the Mushroom Kingdom that will keep you smiling throughout the film.\nIt\u2019s so good, in fact, that you might want to see it in 3D to get even more out of it. If you watch it once in 2D, but want to head back to see it again then the 3D option is well worth a shout.\nThere are some clever screen jumping moments with a lot more action than we were expecting. It\u2019ll look great on home media too when that comes around, but unfortunately 3D Blu-ray is much less of a thing than it used to be, so it\u2019ll be a surprise if it lands on the format.\nMaybe we\u2019ll get a minor resurgence in the 3D home format with the prospect of Avatar 2, but we still don\u2019t know if that\u2019s actually coming down the line or not. As a result, you might want to catch it with specs on the big screen before you miss your chance.\nRELATED: Will Avatar 2 come out on 3D Blu-ray?\nMusic reviewAdvertisement\nAs with all Illumination films, the music in the Super Mario Movie is excellent. We\u2019re not going to ruin any of the surprises for you, but there are some real gems in the mix. This includes eighties classics, modern hits and heavy metal power plays, so there\u2019s a lot to enjoy.\nIt may not be up there with Sing or Sing 2, but when you add in all of the adaptations of the Mario video game music you\u2019ve got a lot of magic. It\u2019ll remind you of some of the best platforming fun of your life and for any newcomers to gaming it might just inspire you to pick up the Nintendo Switch or the soon to arrive console that will be coming next.\nRELATED: What will be the next Nintendo console after the Nintendo Switch?\nCredits scenes review\nYou can read more about what actually takes place in the credits scenes with the link above, but as this is a spoiler free review we\u2019ll just say that they\u2019re good. There are two of them to look forward to with the first just after the cast credits roll and the second right at the very end of the credits.\nThey\u2019re not going to set the social media world alight, but they\u2019re a good mix of fun and teaser. We were hoping for something a little more impactful, but with so much content to cover we\u2019re expecting the Super Mario Bros Movie to become a huge series and maybe Illumination\u2019s most successful to-date.\nSuper Mario Bros Movie review score: 4.5/5\nYou can also check out our movie news section to keep tabs on the latest upcoming films, or visit the official website www.thesupermariobros.movie.\nMore Super Mario news and features:\n- What will be the next Super Mario game\n- Mario Movie age rating and release date\n- How long is the movie?\n- Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope review\n- Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope bosses\n- Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope final boss fight\n- How to hit the ball further in Mario Golf Super Rush\n- How to get and select the lob wedge in Mario Golf Super Rush",

        "text": "Adapting video games into films is a risky business. For starters, the film will predominantly be made for the niche crowd that has played (or at least know of) the game and understand its lore. From a trade perspective, studios usually pay a fortune to get the rights for the adaptation, and what they\u2019re left with to make a film is a fraction of what they started with. If the company that owns the IP decides to be a part of the film, next comes the expectations from the fans that have to be matched and at the same time, it should also be appealing enough to attract a fresh audience.\nRight from not focusing on the parts that made the games famous and not choosing the right medium (The Witcherand The Last of Usproved that some of them make for compelling series), problems are aplenty for game adaptations. Incidentally, the game that started the film adaptation frenzy 30 years ago with Super Mario Bros., is back with The Super Mario Bros. Movie now. But despite being a lovely ode to the legendary gaming franchise, it still flounders thanks to problems unique to this genre.\nThe lack of an intriguing storyline happens to be the biggest problem with The Super Mario Bros. Movie. Every crucial scene the film has reminds you of another famous title. After brothers Mario (Chris Pratt) and Luigi (Charlie Day) started a plumbing business in Brooklyn and faking an Italian accent (more on this later) to make a retro commercial, a plumbing disaster in the city feels like the best opportunity to showcase their talents. When that fiasco Narnia-slaps them into another world filled with several kingdoms, and splits them up to survive and save themselves, Mario befriends Princess Peach (Anya Taylor-Joy) with whom he has to take down the evil conqueror, Bowser (Jack Black).\nThe Super Mario Bros. Movie (English)\nDespite the been-there-seen-that plot, The Super Mario Bros. Movie is a treat for the fans of the franchise. Unlike the 1993 film, the new one ticks a lot of the right boxes. Our favourite plumber isn\u2019t going, \u201cIt\u2019s a me, Mario\u201d at us, but thankfully, the American accent isn\u2019t a dealbreaker either. The film, first and foremost, gets the tone right; from the bustling streets of Brooklyn to the colourful fungi-filled Mushroom Kingdom, the splashy treatment really pays off. Next comes the imperative step of incorporating the game\u2019s elements into the film and considering that the gaming franchise has spawned over 200 games of various genres, picking the best ones would\u2019ve been a tough one. But directors Aaron Horvath and Michael Jelenic, who share a wealth of animation experience between them, lace the film with ample references that are enough to send the fans into a frenzy. There are sequences that pay homage to the world of 2D gaming that was redefined by the 1985 game Super Mario Bros. which most of us would associate the franchise with. They\u2019ve also incorporated the equally famous Mario Kart games, because who wouldn\u2019t love seeing Mario, Princess Peach, Toad (Keegan-Michael Key) and Donkey Kong (Seth Rogen) ride go-karts on a rainbow?\nSpeaking about the princess, there\u2019s even a subtle mention of the famous yet infuriating, \u201cOur princess is in another castle\u201d line. Meanwhile, Princess Peach has come a long way since her game days. She\u2019s no more a damsel in distress, but a fierce warrior who, at a point in the film, actually trains Mario. There are also the power-ups such as the Super Mushroom, Fire Flower, Starman, and minions trying to defeat our overalls-wearing hero. And boy, we get the whole team of baddies, including Koopa Troopas, Piranha Plants, Bullet Bills and Bloopers.\nThe post-credit scene also introduces one of the franchise\u2019s favourite characters to the film world, and the music scores are infused with the original tracks by Koji Kondo. My favourite bit of trivia though is what happened behind the scenes; Charles Martinet, who voices Mario and Luigi in the Mario games, also voice-stars as the brothers\u2019 father in the film and makes up for the lack of Italian accent we love from this franchise.\nBut these good parts are strictly for fans who understand the references and Easter eggs; what\u2019s left for the rest is a rather insipid story. Despite sporting a dream cast, the voice work (apart from that of Black and Key) is a complete letdown, adding no flavour to the film. We\u2019ve gotten used to brilliant stories written for toy films like the Lego Movies and we\u2019re expecting the same from the upcoming Barbie, and this is why it\u2019s bothersome to see the plot for a much-beloved franchise being extremely predictable. It leaves you wishing that the team which meticulously placed some brilliant callbacks would have spent a little more effort coming up with an intriguing story.\nStill, The Super Mario Bros. Movie is undoubtedly a milestone when it comes to game adaptations. Unlike ones like Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun Li, Silent Hill: Revelation, Street Fighter and Assassin\u2019s Creed, the Mario film understands what made the franchise a worldwide success and plays to its strengths that are only heightened with brilliant visuals. But unlike the Sonic the Hedgehog movies and Pok\u00e9mon Detective Pikachu, it doesn\u2019t tell a tale that is intriguing enough to hold our attention. While the film is fan service at its best, the rest of the audience might feel like the bricks in the game Mario punches to nab gold coins from. Only if cheat codes can work in films too!\nThe Super Mario Bros. Movie is currently running in theatres",

        "text": "\"The Super Mario Bros. Movie\" review: an opportunity down the drain\nNintendo and I have had a diverting relationship through the years. One of my most cherished memories is receiving a Nintendo GameCube bundled with Super Mario Sunshine on the Christmas of 2002. Luigi's Mansion, The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker, Super Smash Bros. Melee, Mario Kart Double Dash, and Paper Mario The Thousand-Year Door built the foundation for my adulation and appreciation for video games. This fondness for those adolescent years will always be cosseted in retrospect, however, I find it increasingly more difficult to replicate those wonderful years as my interests mature and my childhood fascinations lessen. Nonetheless, I was chain-chomping at the bit to rekindle my juvenescent soul inside my coarsened interior only to witness a half-baked attempt at nostalgia bait without any resemblance of depth or nuance. In a world where The Lego Movie, Inside Out, and Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse exist, the term \"just for kids\" shouldn't be an excuse for an animated film to lack engrossing voice acting, visual variety, euphoric compositions, and a multifaceted narrative.\nSubjectivity aside, The Super Mario Bros. Movie does have some commendable components. The film opens with a quirky infomercial of the inseparable brother's inefficacious plumbing business, highlighting Mario and Luigi's aspirations of becoming a desirable alternative to the plumbing service they just recently defected from. The brotherly bond is the anchor of the film and is handled as well as it can be given the truncated runtime. Some of the set pieces mirror their in-game counterparts, particularly a 2D side-scrolling race between Mario and Luigi in the first third of the film that perfectly encapsulates each respective character's abilities and traits. Of the relatively uninspired voice acting, Jack Black's minacious attempt at voicing Bowser was appreciated, making Bowser a standout character with his portentous, yet baleful attitude. Brian Tyler and Koji Kondo work wonders bringing to life iconic Mario themes that span multiple decades. There's enjoyment to be had with this film for even the most lambasted moviegoer.\nDespite the occasional flourish, The Super Mario Bros. Movie ultimately falls short, providing a bare-bones story devoid of compelling conflicts, character depth, or thematic layers. It has about as much depth as any mainline Mario game, which is unfortunately a longstanding detractor from the series. What lacks in story is substituted for innovative gameplay mechanics, memorable level design, and indelible art direction. Similarly for a film, narratives can be elevated by their thematic elements. When an integrant of the whole fails to counterbalance what is inherently lacking, those deficiencies become more glaring.\nThe film follows the classic Mario formula precisely. Luigi is separated from his brother and eventually captured by Bowser, setting in motion Mario's world-warping journey to save his brother and protect the Mushroom Kingdom and its inhabitants. Straying from this blueprint isn't necessary as it serves as a decent foundation for the narrative, however, nothing is added to add meat to these dry bones. Mario and Luigi's arcs are relatively nonexistent, haphazardly attempting to create emotional conflicts that are soon forgotten. The setting for the story only transpires over a handful of different biomes, failing to make use of Mario's iconic backlog of traversed landscapes. The script has as much nuance as you'd expect from the writer of Minions: The Rise of Gru, and Big Mommas: Like Father, Like Son. The Super Mario Bros. Movie is severely lacking an identity, a lesson, or a message that resonates with the audience, failing to distinguish itself from anything other than nostalgia bait.\nI'm all for a nostalgia trip when done considerately, it's largely why I placed this film on my most anticipated films of this year. However, not even my wistful expectations of reliving my childhood memories were met, becoming desensitized by the film's inability to find creative ways to incorporate Mario's iconography. Even the enjoyable aspects are somehow overshadowed by questionable decisions such as the film's excessive reliance on the greatest hits from the 80s. When you think of famous Mario themes, perhaps the Ground Theme from Super Mario Bros. comes to mind. What about the Overworld Theme from Super Mario Bros. 2? Jump Up, Super Star! from Super Mario Odyssey? Nah \u2013 here's Take on Me by A-ha and Thunderstruck by AC/DC instead. That's not to say some of these themes and more aren't in the movie, they're just heavily cast aside for licensed music and it's increasingly more frustrating when you hear just how good these original compositions sound.\nThe Super Mario Bros. Movie also suffers from a lack of visual variety. Technically speaking, Illumination's efforts to bring the Mushroom Kingdom to life is a noteworthy achievement. I've seen criticism of the animation being low-effort and I couldn't disagree more. The timing and spacing are fluid, the lighting beautifully reflects off nearby objects, and the character models resemble their gaming counterparts (we don't have a Sonic the Hedgehog situation on our hands). The backgrounds are full of vibrancy, life, and movement, and the attention to detail is noticeable. When I say there's a lack of variety, I mean there's a lack of imaginative ways to incorporate the various visual styles of Mario's past in this film. Nintendo's flagship mascot has overgone countless visual iterations since its conception in 1985. From the 8-bit side-scroller of Super Mario Bros. to the globe-trotting-cap-twirling adventures of Super Mario Odyssey, there's a long lineage of inspiration to pull from that's largely being ignored. The film's locations feel finite, opting to cram these incredibly iconic sceneries into extremely limited expeditious montages. The Super Mario Bros. Movie feels unimaginative, uninspired, and mundane in its worldbuilding, something the games never lacked.\nOrdinary and wearisome are the words I'd use to describe the voice acting in this film. Many were concerned with Chris Pratt's involvement, providing his vocals for one of the most recognized voiced characters by the incomparable Charles Martinet. Martinet does have a nanoscopic role in this film near the beginning and I would have much preferred an entire film voiced by him. Pratt's voice acting fluctuates between a pseudo-Brooklynn accent and a fraudulent Italian accent for most of the film, creating a lack of consistency and cohesion. Anya Taylor-Joy's attempt at voicing Princess Peach left much to be desired, playing it safe and monotone. Seth Rogen is\u2026 Seth Rogen as he always is. Keegan-Michael Key's Toad wasn't as bad as I thought it'd be, his character gets lost in the second half of the film, however, with not much material to work with. The two standout performances were Charlie Day's Luigi and Jack Black's Bowser. Both provided zestful performances with energy and range, accurately associating themselves closely with the essence of their in-game characters.\nAs much as it pains me to say it, it's-a no, for me. Nintendo and Illumination unfortunately played it too safe with their comeback feature. It's a by-the-numbers attempt with little room for risk or imagination. That said, this doesn't deter me from being interested in expanding the NCU (Nintendo Cinematic Universe). The potential to create other animated films from Nintendo's prolific intellectual properties genuinely excites me. In a world where every single blockbuster film is adapted from some sort of source material, Nintendo's backlog feels like the last remaining untapped resource, and I'd love movies from the Zelda and Metroid universes. Let this film be a learning experience and improve upon these qualms moving forward. Ameliorate the paper-thin plot with translucent character development. Add themes and symbolism to create an engaging and heartfelt story. Differentiate yourselves from other run-of-the-mill animated films and don't be afraid of creative risks. There's much to improve, but there's a foundation there.\nfor more features.",

        "text": "The wait is finally over \u2013 Nintendo\u2019s big new The Super Mario Bros. Movie via Illumination Entertainment is here, it\u2019s quite possibly the biggest video game movie produced to date. With several attempts to make Super Mario themed cartoons, a live-action TV show, and the infamous 90s live-action film, it\u2019s time for Mario and Luigi to finally shine in theaters.\nThe new Super Mario Bros. Movie has been carefully built under Nintendo and original creator Shigeru Miyamoto, who co-produced the film alongside Illumination founder and CEO Chris Meledandri. The film also arrives not long after Super Nintendo World opened in the USA. There\u2019s a lot riding on Mario\u2019s new adventure. The Super Mario Bros. Movie is an excellent start for Mario\u2019s film franchise \u2013 read on to find out why!\nThe Super Mario Bros. Movie\nProduction Company: Illumination Entertainment, Nintendo\nPublisher: Universal Pictures\nDirector: Aaron Horvath, Michael Jelenic\nRelease Date: April 5th, 2023\nFirst things first \u2013 to properly set expectations for any fans considering seeing The Super Mario Bros. Movie, this movie essentially sets the stage for a potentially massive cinematic universe (I hate using that term). There\u2019s a lot of world building here and a chunk of the beginning actually establishes both Mario and Luigi as real plumbers in Brooklyn.\nIf you\u2019re a fan of the classic Super Mario Bros. Super Show, you\u2019ll be familiar with their explanation of where the Mario Bros. came from: while doing a job they get sucked down a warp pipe and end up in the Mushroom Kingdom. That\u2019s not far from what happens here, though it\u2019s teased as something a bit more and will likely be explored in later films.\nThe main plot in the Super Mario Bros. Movie is like a mashup \u2013 but with a reoccurring theme of Bowser\u2019s infatuation with Princess Peach. The majority of the movie is all about stopping Bowser and his quest to conquer all the land. The second part of Bowser\u2019s quest, though, is his love for Princess Peach.\nThe movie pokes at this a bit and Jack Black\u2019s performance as Bowser is actually hilarious, he sings too (it definitely sounds like him while singing). The rest of the cast generally do their parts well but Donkey Kong is basically just Seth Rogan as himself, while Keegan-Michael Key as Toad is harder to tell.\nThere was a lot of controversy with Chris Pratt being cast as Mario and not series mainstay Charles Martinet. While there\u2019s a really cute passing of the torch from Martinet to Pratt, both Mario and Luigi speak in a normal accent. There is a hint of the caricature-like accents from Mario and Luigi\u2019s past, but this is explained away quickly in a clever bit.\nIf you\u2019re looking for a really clever take on the Mario formula, you\u2019re not going to find it here. This is a classic Mario story, through and through. Conversely, in the new Sonic the Hedgehog live action movies they took a more serious and realistic approach to explaining the characters, the other worlds, the lore, and the special powers. In the Mario Movie, things just are because they are that way.\nVisuals are spectacular as expected from the unity of Illumination and Nintendo. Character expressions and animations are vibrant, and the landscapes from Brooklyn to the Mushroom Kingdom all look great. The movie jumps between different locales, all with their own feel and like any Mario game, they all have gameplay purpose. The hint at Luigi\u2019s Mansion was excellent but sadly short.\nSome previous attempts at video game movie adaptations generally framed the \u201cgameplay\u201d in the movie as simply how the character(s) interact with each other and the world. The Super Mario Bros. Movie actually frames things around gameplay itself, right down to how the iconic Mario powerups have worked for decades. One blue mushroom Mario gets will squeeze a pre-emptive laugh out.\nThe film starts with gameplay immediately as Mario and Luigi traverse a construction site from a 2D perspective just like you\u2019d see in a real Super Mario game. There\u2019s so many calls to gameplay mechanics that fans of the series know and love it\u2019s overwhelming. There\u2019s also, naturally, a bunch of power-ups that Mario and others cycle through (like mushrooms)\nThis simple concept of framing gameplay mechanics directly into a game movie adaptation seems to have ruffled the feathers of corporate media. Generally I think this stems from the fact most of them don\u2019t actually play video games. They\u2019d rather watch things happen on screen, so a reminder that you still have to \u201cplay\u201d video games triggered them.\nFans of Super Mario and Nintendo\u2019s other games will be in for a treat with easter eggs, the movie is littered with them. From the beginnings with the Punch Out-themed restaurant to Mario actually playing the original Kid Icarus in his bedroom, there\u2019s tons of nostalgic references. At times it can feel like there\u2019s maybe too many hidden nuggets, but it\u2019s never enough to make non-gamers feel left out.\nThere\u2019s naturally tons of nods to the various series from the DK Rap to the entire Mario Kart segment. The music changes appropriately too \u2013 Bowser \u201cjams out\u201d with the iconic underground theme on piano and when Mario is underwater you hear a slight hint of the underwater theme. My favorite was probably the nod at the Rainbow Road shortcut from Mario Kart 64.\nLicensed songs are here, too, and while they work I could see how they could annoy people when the original score really is fantastic. I genuinely chuckled when AC/DC\u2019s \u201cThunderstruck\u201d rolled in when the characters were building their vehicles to go riding on Rainbow Road. A-ha\u2019s ever classic one-hit-wonder \u201cTake On Me\u201d was pushing it, though I do love that song.\nWithout spoiling too much, Luigi doesn\u2019t get much screentime and this is likely due to the story focusing on Mario and Peach. Early marketing suggested Peach was going to be a proud and strong female that don\u2019t need no man, but the actual movie is far from that. The film simply focuses more on the everlasting lust Bowser, a giant turtle monster, has for Peach, a human. Mario and Luigi get stuck in the middle.\nWith such a massive legacy, there\u2019s so many different expectations of how the movie could go. I think some will be upset the movie really sticks to its video game roots and overtly throws in classic Mario game mechanics. As noted I personally loved this. The movie doesn\u2019t try to be anything more than a big screen adaptation of the Mario series, and that\u2019s fine.\nI think my main gripe is that I wanted more action and character building from the movie. There\u2019s so much to cover so the story moves fast, before you know it the stage is set for the big final battle. You never learn the true motivations behind Donkey Kong, and sadly one of Mario\u2019s best companions only gets a tiny bit of screentime \u2013 but more on that later.\nThe Super Mario Bros. Movie basically feels like the foundation for what is likely going to be a big movie franchise for Nintendo. There\u2019s a ton of set up, world building, characters introduced, and gameplay mechanics added throughout, but it feels like this is just the beginning. Still I think this is fine, and yet I just wanted a bit more from the film.\nUltimately fans will really enjoy the Super Mario Bros. Movie and everything it does. It doesn\u2019t reinvent the series formula and really stays close to the source material, with tons of love for everything Super Mario. I may have really felt like I wanted a bit more but it\u2019s obvious they\u2019re going to make more and the final post-credits scene has me ecstatic Mario\u2019s pal is back.\nOverall the Super Mario Bros. Movie is a faithful take on one of the most iconic franchises and characters in video game history. I went in with my own hopes and came out impressed the movie gave me some good laughs and had me genuinely satisfied as a lifelong Mario fan.\nThe Super Mario Bros.

Movie,\u201d which hits theaters Wednesday and has generated quite a bit of buzz leading up to its Easter-weekend release.\nThe animated film based on the cherished video-game series of the same name boasts a star-studded voice cast, including Anya Taylor-Joy as Princess Peach, Charlie Day as Luigi, Jack Black as Bowser, Keegan-Michael Key as Toad, Seth Rogen as Donkey Kong, Fred Armisen as Cranky Kong and Chris Pratt as Mario.\nWhen the family flick was announced back in 2021, fans and social media users immediately questioned the decision to cast Pratt \u2014 who has been racking up credits in blockbuster movie franchises like item boxes in Mario Kart \u2014 as everyone\u2019s favorite Italian plumber.\n\u2018The Super Mario Bros. Movie,\u2019 starring Chris Pratt, is mildly amusing, swift, noisy and unrelentingly paced.\nIn her review for Tribune News Service, film critic Katie Walsh deemed Pratt and Day\u2019s vocal performances as sibling duo Mario and Luigi \u201cso unremarkable that it could have been anyone at all.\u201d\n\u201cFortunately, this loud, hectic movie doesn\u2019t overstay its welcome, but it wouldn\u2019t have the material to last a second longer,\u201d Walsh writes.\n\u201cIt\u2019s bright, busy, inoffensive and exactly the opposite of the weird, dark, edgy 1993 movie adaptation.

        "text": "The Super Mario Bros Movie is a deranged mishmash\nIf you thought Chris Pratt\u2019s voice performance was going to be the weak link, you might be surprised to discover there\u2019s a lot of competition.\nHow much of a free pass do you get from goodwill and nostalgia? Or is it actually doubly hard if you\u2019re tinkering with something hundreds of millions of people have a connection to?\nAudiences under a certain vintage will have fond memories of manoeuvring a little bouncing plumber in red, whether it was 30 years ago on those old, grey Game Boy bricks or last week, drunkenly challenging your mates to Mario Kart, insistent that you are the champion of the Yoshi Circuit.\nSo, when there\u2019s an animated movie adaptation, there\u2019s no doubt you\u2019ll get a kick out of seeing bits of gameplay incorporated on the big screen. Eating a power-up mushroom, jumping atop a speeding Bullet Bill or throwing a Koopa shell at an opponent will unlock a little \u201cwahoo\u201d from your inner child.\nBut it\u2019s not enough to be jump up and down and go, \u201cLook! Look over here! It\u2019s all the fun parts of Mario you like!\u201d when the whole package is a deranged mishmash of overstimulating elements.\nIn The Super Mario Bros Movie, Mario (Chris Pratt) and Luigi (Charlie Day) are Brooklyn brothers who have just struck out on their own to start their plumbing business. But their old boss and their dad think they\u2019re destined to fail.\nThis crisis of faith from everyone else also bolsters Mario to prove the naysayers wrong so when the opportunity comes to save his borough from the plumbing disaster, he goes in all wrenches ablazing.\nHe and Luigi are sucked through a Bifrost-esque portal to other worlds \u2013 Mario to the Mushroom Kingdom and Luigi to the Dark Lands. Mario needs to rescue his baby brother and help to save the Mushroom Kingdom from a conquering Bowser (Jack Black) who\u2019s on the tear in his bid to marry Princess Peach (Anya Taylor-Joy).\nThere are also classic Mario characters including Donkey Kong (Seth Rogen) and the very adorable Toad (Keegan Michael-Key).\nIf you think of The Super Mario Bros Movie as only a diverting entertainment product aimed purely at younger kids, then the movie directed by Aaron Horvath and Michael Jelenic makes sense.\nIt\u2019s not unlike the Trolls movies, overstuffed with cacophonous sounds and action that whizzes through a frame in half a second, all contained within a rainbow and glitter palette that will give a headache to anyone over single digits.\nBut if it\u2019s designed to hit more than one sliver of the overall audience pie, if it\u2019s meant to offer something to begrudging parents and or child-free adults hoping for a nostalgia ride than The Super Mario Bros Movie does not work.\nThere are too many things going on, little emotional investment in anyone\u2019s fate, a terrible script and characters with as much depth as, um, the first iteration of the Super Mario Bros game.\nYou get away with that more in a game environment when the player controls the character, transposing themselves into the story. But as a passive viewer of a movie, it needs to do a lot more to hook someone.\nJust being loud and busy, or throwing in some clever references to the games, is not enough. The only thing is does do is make you reconsider the much-derided 1993 live action Mario movie with Bob Hoskins and John Leguizamo. In comparison, that\u2019s not looking so bad.\nRating: 1.5/5\nThe Super Mario Bros Movie is in cinemas now",

        "text": "The Super Mario Bros. Movie (2023)\nWritten by Matthew Fogel\nDirected by Aaron Horvath & Michael Jelenic\nDespite numerous adaptations to film & television, live-action & animated, Mario remains one of the most nebulous pop culture characters regarding his narrative arc. Most cartoon shows begin in media res; Mario is already the hero and, accompanied by his friends Luigi, Toad, and Peach, fights the good fight against Bowser & his Koopa Troopas. The hybrid Super Mario Bros. Super Show television series exists as this strange liminal object, with the framing device of Captain Lou Albano & Danny Wells, as Mario & Luigi, respectively, introducing audiences to cartoon stories about them. Yet, there is never an apparent effort made to establish the timeline of events. The 1993 live-action movie starring Bob Hoskins & John Leguizamo veers off into its own unique & bizarre direction, positing a parallel dinosaur-dominated timeline. As much presence as Mario has in American & Japanese culture since the 1980s, no one seems very concerned about the story behind the plumber. In this way, The Super Mario Bros. Movie exists as the first origin story that adheres closely to the designs & relationship dynamics of the video games.\nMario (Christopher Pratt) and Luigi (Charles Day) are plumbing brothers who have left their previous employer, Spike, to start their own business. An unsuccessful first job brings the brothers down, but a massive manhole leak flooding the city has Mario dragging Luigi downtown to help. They descend into the sewers and discover a strange labyrinth seemingly forgotten by time and proceed to be separated after a warp pipe pulls them in. Luigi ends up in the Darklands, which puts him directly in the clutches of the despotic King Bowser (Jacob Black). Meanwhile, Mario finds himself in the fantastical Mushroom Kingdom, led by plucky sidekick Toad (Keegan Michael-Key) to the region\u2019s monarch Princess Peach (Anya Taylor-Joy). Bowser is headed their way with a Super Star, and the locals don\u2019t know what he has planned. A quick run through a platformer obstacle course and an introduction to power-ups see Mario & Peach on their way.\nThe duo\u2019s first stop is at the Jungle Kingdom, where Peach hopes to convince their ruler, Cranky Kong (Fereydun Armisen), as his people, combined with Peach\u2019s, would be a formidable army for Bowser to go up against. Cranky issues a prerequisite, though, for this alliance to be forged, Mario must defeat the ape-man\u2019s son, Donkey Kong (Seth Rogen), in hand-to-hand combat. Mario struggles to hold his own in this battle until discovering a Super Bell power-up which gives him a powerful catsuit that he uses to handily defeat his brutish competitor. The forces of the Jungle Kingdom take to their kart transports and drive along the Rainbow Road to join Peach\u2019s armies but are ambushed by Bowser and his armada. Complications ensue that separate the characters for them to self-actualize and become the archetypal figures we know them as in the context of the video games. In the end, evil is defeated, yet as we know as adults, can evil truly ever be stopped?\nYou may have noticed the formalized tone of this review so far. After reading some ridiculous responses to professional critics\u2019 takes on the movie, I wrote it like that. America and its domestic big-budget movies are just escapist trash at this point. There hasn\u2019t been any point in the history of the United States when most popular entertainment has been less culturally relevant than it is right now. There seems to be a \u201cthrow shit at the wall and see if it sticks\u201d mantra as the guiding force in all major studio releases. Any intellectual properties a studio or its parent company can access will be developed into movies or shows on a streaming platform with little regard to the audience\u2019s demands. Hell, the audiences just seem to want bright colors, quick cuts, and loud noises. Who has time for a story or character development that doesn\u2019t follow well-established formulas?\nRotten Tomatoes is just one of the worst websites ever made, which has led audiences to develop animosity toward professional critics. They must understand that a professional film critic writing for a newspaper or nationally circulated magazine sees almost every major studio movie. Critics\u2019 criteria for judging a movie are not based on how much they love the pre-existing IP. What they are looking for and why they are watching the film in that theater is different from why a fan of the IP would be in the theater. Thus, a disparity in the incredibly broken & vague metric that Rotten Tomatoes uses. I tend to look at the Critics\u2019 Score vs. Audience Score as a saying, \u201cIf you don\u2019t already love this thing, here\u2019s what you will likely think,\u201d vs. \u201cif you already love the characters, here\u2019s what you will likely think.\u201d\nWill a child enjoy The Super Mario Bros. Movie? Maybe, some will, I guess, if they are really into Mario. Did I enjoy this movie? I chuckled less than a dozen times and got bored about a third of the way into the film, which only clocks in at 92 minutes. My problem with the movie is likely not one a child will have, though I know some pretty media-savvy kids who might turn their noses up. The Mario movie is rife with cliches to the point that the entire arc of Mario and every other character is just copy/pasted from every film like this that has ever been made. I was really disappointed in that, but ultimately not shocked. I hoped they would throw some curveballs at us and surprise us with plot beats we might not expect. Not only do they not shake up the story in any way, but I am confident that any semi-regular film viewer can predict each plot point once the movie starts.\nOf the actors, only one stood out to me as trying to voice act, Jack Black. He is changing his voice to play Bowser in a significant way. Do they take advantage of the actor\u2019s talent for singing? Yup. That\u2019s the only thing I didn\u2019t anticipate about the movie, not that it made much difference. The rest of the voice acting is just dull & lifeless. I don\u2019t know how these people were directed, but the vibe I got was that they were told to use as little emotion in their voices as possible, with only Seth Rogen choosing to break that rule. He doesn\u2019t do anything other than talk in his regular speaking voice, though. Chris Pratt, Charlie Day, and Anya Taylor-Joy sound like themselves, not terrible, but nothing that evokes the feeling of Super Mario.\nIt is fun to see the Mario characters animated in three dimensions, engaged in a movie plot, but it\u2019s also as insubstantial as cotton candy. Attempts are made at lazy character arcs; Mario laments his father doesn\u2019t respect him, but no one cares in the audience or the production crew. This certainly has all the hallmarks of an Illumination animated movie. They do certainly throw as many Mario easter eggs and references as possible over the runtime, so if you like pointing at a movie screen and saying, \u201cI know that thing,\u201d well, then do I have the film for you.",

        "text": "This \u201880s nostalgia extravaganza has something for everyone, from those who remember playing Nintendo in their childhoods, to a new generation of fans.\nThe Super Mario Bros. of old were in desperate need of an image revamp \u2013 from bad Italian stereotypes to sexist portrayals of princesses in distress. Fortunately, the new vision of the brothers is largely successful in its glow-up, although they could have perhaps done better than a forced marriage storyline. Princess Peach is a kick-ass hero in her own right \u2013 while maintaining the right to be completely clad in pastel pink \u2013 and the mega baddie Bowser is a pathetic quasi-incel.\nThe production has attracted some impressive star power, with Chris Pratt voicing Mario, Anya Taylor-Joy behind Princess Peach and Jack Black bringing Bowser to life. The latter works particularly well, as Bowser/Black blasts out 1980s rock ballads that would put Meatloaf to shame. In this way, 'The Super Mario Bros. Movie' seems to take a few liberties from the 'Frozen' franchise, with the second film\u2019s focus on 1980s love ballads, focus on sibling love and a blonde wearing blue freezing things with her hands (it\u2019s in the games, but still).\nWonderfully, Donkey Kong (Seth Rogen) also makes an appearance, a real treat for those brought up on the barrel-jumping games. There are tonnes of nods to game features, including Mario Kart's Rainbow Road, which has the audience particularly excited. The movie really captures the evolutions of the games, adults and kids alike cheering in their seats.\n'The Super Mario Bros. Movie' is a really enjoyable popcorn movie suitable for young and old. Make sure you stick around for the final-final credits, to see a nod toward a potential sequel.",

        "text": "It\u2019s unsurprising that Nintendo turned to Illumination to faithfully bring their beloved flagship characters to life. Whilst the studio responsible for Despicable Me and everyone\u2019s favourite/hated Minions isn\u2019t exactly revered for their quality films, they know how to produce monster hits with audiences at the box office. This partnership between the game developer and animation studio has produced predictable results: The Super Mario Bros. Movie is a vibrant, if paper-thin, rollercoaster that is going to dominate multiplexes.\nLet\u2019s get the internet controversies out of the way. The voice acting is dismissible across the board, with Jack Black\u2019s Bowser standing out. Whilst it is sort of addressed why the core cast don\u2019t have their iconic voices, it\u2019s still jarring at how normal and unremarkable the performances are. You do acclimatise to them by the end of the first act, but even if Illumination wanted to take the characters into new directions they would have got better results from actual voice actors rather than Hollywood A-listers.\nBack to the story \u2013 what there is of it anyway. Mario (Chris Pratt) and Luigi (Charlie Day) are plumbers working in Brooklyn trying to make a name for themselves on one particular job in the sewers when they inadvertently get sucked into a pipe that separates them and spits them out into the Mushroom Kingdom. Mario teams up with Toad (Keegan-Michael Key) and Princess Peach (Anya Taylor-Joy) to save Luigi, who has been captured by Bowser. Turns out the big bad lizard wants to rule the world, so the colourful characters enlist the help of other iconic Mario characters in their effort to save not just Luigi but the Mushroom Kingdom and beyond.\nThe narrative breezes by in an hour and a half, which is both a blessing and a curse. The themes and character arcs are as bare bones as a Dry Bones; set up in an agonisingly obvious way before quickly resolving them without tact or fanfare before the credits roll. Unlike other western animated features of late, there\u2019s zero emotion for any of the characters here. The story is simply a means to bounce between each reference-laden setting and set piece, which makes the whole thing feel rushed and undercooked.\nAll of this is a shame because there are hints of something truly special. Visually, it really is Illumination\u2019s best work yet. With Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto on board as producer, it could well be that Nintendo were breathing down the necks of everyone at Illumination to get every detail right, but the results are remarkable. The Mushroom Kingdom and other iconic locales have been lovingly rendered and brought to life in vivid colours and bouncy animation. Designs of characters, items and locations take details from different games and fuse them into something recognisable albeit fresh. And if there is something Illumination has always been good at, it\u2019s the background references and gags, which come in abundance here.\nFans will be itching to watch The Super Mario Bros. Movie again and again just to catch every easter egg and reference. Every frame is packed with callbacks to the different Mario games; some obvious, some only the most diehard fans will understand. As a lifelong Mario and Nintendo player, but not a super fan per se, it was fun seeing so many moments faithfully recreated or cleverly alluded to, but it causes concern for how much non-gamers and those unfamiliar with Mario will get out of this film. One nostalgic element that will certainly work for everyone is the music by Brian Tyler. Tyler cleverly takes Konji Kondo\u2019s legendary themes and music and masterfully incorporates them into pivotal moments, highlighting the whimsy and adventurous score.\nIf there\u2019s one thing clear from this review so far, it is that The Super Mario Bros. Movie is mostly hindered by Illumination\u2019s usual issues. Beside the lacklustre story, there are far too many self-referential jokes that undercut the tone and setting (as well as just being unfunny), and a heavy reliance on licensed pop music. A-ha\u2019s Take On Me playing as characters drive a kart through Kong\u2019s jungle kingdom is a worse feeling than being taken out by a blue shell in first place on Mario Kart. If there is a saving grace, however, it\u2019s Bowser. Pairing amazing design and animation with a genuinely great performance from Black, the king koopa is as hilarious as he is unpredictably threatening. It helps that he gets a killer musical number too.\nThe Super Mario Bros. Movie will surely delight fans and younger audiences with its faithful and colourful visuals. It\u2019s just disappointing that Mario, Luigi and the gang have to settle for something so mediocre, particularly when big-budget western animation has seen incredible features from Sony and Dreamworks. There will no doubt be a sequel down the line, so here\u2019s hoping Illumination takes a page from their book and not only evolve the visuals but the storytelling too.\nThe Super Mario Bros. Movie is out now in cinemas.",

        "text": "There\u2019s been a surprisingly big discussion online surrounding The Super Mario Bros. Movie after critics seemingly felt quite mixed about the project. Nintendo\u2019s first real foray into producing a project based on their IP mixed with Illumination adds a lot of pressure for this film to succeed. Box office-wise the film is set to break records left and right but the question remains if the plumber\u2019s adventure to the Mushroom Kingdom truly translated well into animation after the questionable first attempt in live-action.\nWhat stands out is that the film is visually stunning and the designs are certainly true to the original game franchise; a sign that Nintendo had close control over their work to stay true to the original. Part of me did wish that the minions got a Paper Mario treatment with some unique standouts outside of a Toad wearing a backpack being one of the main characters. The worlds were captivating and it definitely ranks among Illumination\u2019s more creative works, which was something I had some concern about as their overall design work can be quite plain.\nThe biggest concern for some was the voice work with the film going all-in with the modern \u201cbig name actors\u201d casting choices. Yet, I was surprised by Chris Pratt\u2019s overall performance with some great performances here and there. Seth Rogen could\u2019ve put in a bit more work to give Donkey Kong a more familiar voice, as we also just get his signature laugh in this film. He had some great moments but I won\u2019t lie it felt like a missed opportunity given how iconic his voice is in Donkey Kong 64.\nAnya Taylor-Joy was okay as Princess Peach, she gave a good performance but it didn\u2019t really stand out either. The true scene-stealers were Jack Black as Bowser and Charlie Day as Luigi. They both perfectly brought the right energy to these characters even if I do wish Luigi, who is cutely named Lu by Mario in this rendition, was given a bigger role in this film but perhaps we get a Luigi\u2019s Mansion spinoff film one day.\nAs much as I\u2019ll definitely say I had a blast with the film, it does overall feel a bit rushed at parts. It didn\u2019t really have a strong plot pulled together that would build upon each other but rather just wanted to hit some vignettes with loose character motivation to keep it together. Peach wants to protect her people and is willing to give up everything for it. Mario wants to prove to his family that he isn\u2019t dragging his brother down with him, which actually was the best part of the film\u2019s theme.\nBowser has a neat surprise in his overall motivation that is inspired by some of the most recent entries in the Super Mario franchise, though I wished they kept it a secret for a longer period of time. Its overall issue is that it simply tries too much and doesn\u2019t set a clear focus. We spend time with Bowser and find out his motivation, trying to create a dynamic between him and Mario even though they never face each other to build up to an eventual climax. Yet, it would\u2019ve been great to actually have these two compete, he actively takes his brother away adding to one of the main conflicts in the film.\nLuigi taking Peach\u2019s role in the story as confirmed in the trailers is a good way to add something new without falling into clich\u00e9 territory but it all feels rather disconnected. We spend most of the film\u2019s runtime building up to one storyline that is squashed after a fun action sequence. Mario\u2019s main motivation set early on was probably the best jumping-off point they could\u2019ve given the film but it never truly comes together to become its central theme until the last few minutes.\nYet, even with these issues and Illumination\u2019s usual hyper-fixation on including pop songs in sequences (especially with the now-confirmed fantastic Donkey Kong-inspired song having been scrapped), the film has heart. I still got a bit teary-eyed during the final moments. Mario and Luigi make a great pairing, which I didn\u2019t think the film would make me care about for as little screen time they share. There\u2019s heart here and it overshadows its very easter egg showcase, as there are a lot of them.\nThere are certainly a lot of Easter eggs for long-time Nintendo fans and likely one of the major draws of this film. It knows it is playing to nostalgia in a big way, which is surprisingly more dominant than what Marvel has been accused of throughout the years. It wouldn\u2019t be too surprised if they use this film as a jumping-off point for spinoffs moving forward and there\u2019s a chance that they could get some of these elements together in a sequel.\nBest case, they start taking some more inspiration from Paper Mario or the Mario & Luigi games, as those had some really great storytelling. The first film had to ease viewers into this world but now there\u2019s no stopping them from going all-in. Introduce a new villain in the form of Cackletta and the super memorable Fawful. Introduce viewers to Koopa\u2019s normal living environments that are more than just those minions we witnessed in the film. Otherwise, these films might just end up as more of the same.\nEither way, the film is a blast through and through. Yes, it falls into some usual pitfalls but there\u2019s still a lot of fun to have. The jokes land when they land. We have a surprisingly strong cast here that brings it together. Peaches will be trapped in my head for all eternity. The heart that this film has overshadows most of its issues, and while it doesn\u2019t offer too much depth in its story, it still does what it needs to do to keep you engaged throughout. It\u2019s definitely worth a watch and is the Mario film we wished the 1993 film was.",

        "text": "The Super Mario Bros. Movie Parent Guide\nThe story is underwritten and the characters are flat but this film is bright, fun, and filled with jokes for viewers of all ages.\nParent Movie Review\nBrooklyn brothers Mario (Chris Pratt) and Luigi (Charlie Day) are struggling to get their new plumbing business off the ground. While exploring the sewer system, they both get sucked into a mysterious pipe that leads them to magical worlds. Luigi finds himself in a barren world of lava and skeleton zombies ruled by the terrifying Bowser (Jack Black), while Mario falls into a world of mushrooms led by the courageous Princess Peach (Anya Taylor-Joy). With Bowser intent on taking over all the kingdoms in the realm, Mario and Peach team up to defeat him and save Luigi.\nI told a coworker that I was seeing this movie and she asked if it would be a good choice for someone who has zero knowledge of the Nintendo property. To answer her question publicly, no. Although I enjoyed the film overall, which I\u2019ll expand on in a moment, I don\u2019t recommend it for people who don\u2019t know anything about the Mario games. You do not have to be an expert (I know I\u2019m not) but you should have some basic ideas of the characters and their worlds, or you\u2019ll be completely lost and probably quite bored.\nIllumination is possibly my least favorite major animation studio. With maybe one or two exceptions their productions are generally lackluster, immature, and poorly written. Super Mario Bros unfortunately falls into some of the same traps as its studio siblings. The story is underwritten, most of the characters are flat, and the script comes across as juvenile. The plot serves mainly to set up video game call back set pieces, with very little keeping the scenes together.\nThat all said, I had a great time and so did the theater full of kids. What little plot there is manages to be fun and deliver positive messages about courage, teamwork, and persistence. There are some great jokes that even got me howling with laughter and, contrived as the set pieces may be, they are super enjoyable. Troops of monkeys and turtles fighting Mad Max-style in Go Karts on a rainbow? Come on, that\u2019s just great cinema. Jack Black is the glue holding this precarious production together as he brings the perfect balance of menace and ridiculousness and even gets to flex his musical chops.\nI want to make a special shout out to the composer, Brian Tyler, who crafted the perfect blend of the original Nintendo score (by Koji Kondo) into an orchestral score. The soundtrack pays homage to the familiar themes, but not to the point that it becomes annoying; on the contrary, it\u2019s absolutely fantastic.\nOverall, I think children and fans of the franchise are going to have a blast with this movie. No, it\u2019s not going to win any writing awards, but it made me laugh and it looks good which is more than I can say for most children\u2019s media. Parents need only worry about the fantasy violence throughout, which could be a bit scary for very young viewers. If you\u2019re ok with a lot of spectacle and not much substance, The Super Mario Bros Movie is sure to power up family movie night.Directed by Aaron Horvath, Michael Jelenic.

        "text": "The Super Mario Bros. Movie is a vibrant love-letter to fans of the games. But when the paper-thin plot and certain underwhelming voice performances threaten to ruin the experience, Jack Black and Nintendo nostalgia are there to save the day.\nSuper Mario Bros Movie Review\nIn Brooklyn, brother plumbers Mario (Chris Pratt) and Luigi (Charlie Day) have just started their own business and are trying to make a name for themselves. Things aren't going well, but when a plumbing disaster threatens their neighborhood, the brothers side scroll their way into action. When they arrive on the scene they quickly discover a mysterious green pipe that sucks them into a new world. Separated in the pipes, Luigi winds up in Bowser's (Jack Black) kingdom, who's set on conquering all the lands. Mario however ends up in the Mushroom Kingdom where he meets Toad (Keegan-Michael Key). In order to find Luigi and save this Kingdom he teams up with Princess Peach (Anya Taylor-Joy) and Donkey Kong (Seth Rogen).\nThe Super Mario Bros. Movie walks the line of being accessible to general audiences while layering in so many easter eggs, callbacks, and inside jokes for those of us who are longtime fans. Each Kingdom pops to life with incredible vibrancy and detail while the score (not the over-used 80s ballads) is littered with nostalgia. Black's Bowser steals the whole show thankfully, because the plot is thinner than Paper Mario with underwhelming performances to boot.\nNot only does Bowser start the film he is the undeniable star. Every scene that features the King of the Koopas standouts and that is all thanks to Black. Bowser stomps through the levels, er I mean worlds, with a simmering rage that eventually boils out like a volcano. But this baddie is also an attention seeking, impulsive kanji turtle. Black effortlessly handles the unpredictability of Bowser's colorful personality and makes him an absolute blast to watch. He even performs a Tenacious D style power ballad in Peach's honor that will be stuck in your head for quite a while.\nKey gives Toad a sense of joy in the face of anything as well as an unwavering faith in his companions. When paired with Mario and Peach, Toad easily outshines them both. Director Michael Jelenic's daughter, Juliet Jelenic, makes for another scene-stealer as the nihilistic Lumalee. This bright little star delivers her memorable depressive one-liners with a youthful glee that essentially guarantees a laugh. Day brings his classic frenetic energy to Luigi and it works well for the brother who is consistently unsure of himself. Unfortunately he is sidelined throughout most of the film but I hope to see Day take on Luigi's Mansion if it is ever adapted for the screen.\nRogen is decent as Donkey Kong, not bad but not exactly all that memorable either. However he is miles ahead of both Pratt and Taylor-Joy. Princess Peach would have been better served by an experienced voice actress who can be both sweet and fierce. Taylor-Joy felt like she was phoning in her lines. Pratt's casting as Mario was met with skepticism from the start and his performance here doesn't do anything to justify his casting. The lack of the classic Mario voice is addressed quickly in similar fashion as the recent Chip and Dale Rescue Rangers movie. But his Brooklyn accent leaves much to be desired and wavers between not good at best and distracting at worst. Charles Martinet, the actual voice of Mario, plays Mario and Luigi's dad as well as another family member. His Brooklyn accent sounds fine which again begs the question, why not have him voice Mario to begin with?\nThe Super Mario Bros. Movie is a love letter to fans of all ages. It is packed with so many references, easter eggs, and inside jokes it will be next to impossible to find them all the first viewing. Not only are these found in the visuals or dialogue \u2013 the princess is not in this castle, but also within Brian Tyler's score. The way he weaves in Koji Kondo\u2019s original orchestrations makes for one feel good, nostalgia-filled soundtrack. The overused 80s ballads could have been left on the cutting room floor though. Visually, the film is striking with its rich colors and remarkable details. It levels up the overall experience for fans as it truly feels like you are sitting inside the games you love.\nThe result is a movie that is perfect for longtime Nintendo fans who adore Mario as well as families looking for something their younger children will enjoy. The plumbers are sure to be a hit and future spin-offs are inevitable. The post credit scenes hint at some possible worlds the Warp Pipes may take us to next. Ultimately, The Super Mario Bros. Movie isn't a perfect run, but Bowser and nostalgia swoop in to save the day just when you need them most.\nThe Super Mario Bros. is now playing in theaters. It is rated PG for action and mild violence with a runtime of 92 minutes.",

        "text": "The Super Mario Bros. Movie Review: It's-A Meh\nFor better and worse, \"The Super Mario Bros. Movie\" is exactly what you'd expect from a Mario movie made by Illumination Entertainment. Since 2010's \"Despicable Me,\" Illumination has developed a reputation as the most average of the major animation studios, aiming for the lowest common denominator with consistent competency and making tons of money in the process without ever reaching the creative heights of the best Pixar or DreamWorks movies.\nThat safe consistency was likely a selling point for \"Mario\" creator Shigeru Miyamoto and the team at Nintendo, who've been wary of Hollywood since the bonkers-bad 1993 live-action \"Super Mario Bros.\" Illumination's animated \"The Super Mario Bros. Movie\" is not an embarrassing disaster like that previous adaptation, and for that alone it's probably going to make a billion dollars. It's respectful of its source material and the quantity of in-jokes and Easter eggs is high enough that fans of the games will likely enjoy themselves while watching it.\nJust don't go in expecting anything more than that. Where the \"Mario\" game series has included some of the most creative and innovative work in the medium over the past 40 years, the \"Mario\" movie is only mildly creative and couldn't have innovation any further from its mind. Still one of the best video game-based movies by default, its weaknesses highlight the differences between mediums and why it's so hard to make a good adaptation for most games in the first place.\nThe main character is the worst character\nSo let's address the biggest source of skepticism about \"The Super Mario Bros. Movie\": Chris Pratt's Mario voice. Honestly, he's not doing a terrible job so much as I'm not sure anyone really knows what the job is. In the video games, Mario is by nature a blank slate for the player to fill, \"WA-HOO\"-ing his way around other more distinctive characters. Movie Mario, in contrast, needs a personality and a character arc, which the film can't really piece together. If Pratt's Mario sounds gruff one minute and like Linda Belcher the next, It's because there's no clear direction for how he's supposed to play this non-character.\nSo who is movie Mario? He no longer talks like an Italian stereotype but now lives with a whole family of them. Being a plumber would seem to indicate working class, down-to-earth goals, but bizarrely his family treats Mario's desired profession as an unachievable aspiration. Mario's early-career woes seem to place him and Luigi (Charlie Day) in their 20s, something Pratt's performance never convincingly pulls off. In an attempt at seriousness, Mario also has a lot of angst about feeling \"small,\" a narrative thread which completely fizzles out. Also, he hates eating mushrooms, because IRONY.\nThe smartest choice the filmmakers made for Mario's characterization is to center his willingness to repeatedly try and fail. Trial and error is familiar to anyone who's played a Mario platformer, so translating that experience into the actual story is clever and the closest any of the attempts at standard family film \"message\" stuff come to working. The script also gets some decent mileage out of the sibling relationship between Mario and Luigi. Making Luigi the one who gets initially captured by Bowser (Jack Black) rather than Princess Peach (Anya Taylor-Joy) gives Mario's quest more personal stakes while also letting Peach be a more independent character than she's typically been in the mainline game series.\nI do wish that quest felt more substantial, though. There's basically four major set pieces in this 92-minute movie: a training course, Mario vs. Donkey Kong (Seth Rogen), the Rainbow Road Mario Kart sequence, and a finale which is one of the few things still left unspoiled by the movie's copious advertising. All are fun bursts of action that benefit from Illumination's most beautiful animation to date and Brian Tyler's high-energy orchestrations of Koji Kondo's classic musical themes. What's lacking is the sense of exploration that makes the games feel so big. I'm reluctant to say that the film should have been longer, but it's almost paradoxical that as bare bones as the games' stories are, the movie that tries to expand on them feels small in comparison.\nFan service makes the generic parts go down easier\nWhile my critic brain found fault with \"The Super Mario Bros. Movie,\" I must confess that my nerd brain had a really good time with a lot of it. I loved how much care was put into making the Mushroom Kingdom a detailed, lived-in environment \u2014 this will certainly be an effective advertisement for Universal's Super Nintendo Land theme park experience. I loved hearing Charlie Day scream as Luigi and Jack Black carry a tune as Bowser (yes, he gets to sing). I had fun with all the game references, from a shortcut through a construction site that perfectly matches Level 1-1 from the original \"Super Mario Bros.\" game to a perfect deployment of every \"Mario Kart\" player's least favorite item. I'm still trying to wrap my head around the fact the Nintendo Entertainment System exists within the universe of this movie based on the NES' launch title, but best not to overthink this sort of thing.\nI would have had an even better time if the non-reference humor was more inspired. A lot of it is of the typical stating-the-obvious sort you see in a lot of middle-of-the-road family cartoons: the cute characters acknowledge their cuteness, someone yells \"DRAMA\" at a dramatic moment, etc. Even some of the \"adult\" gags play out in rather obvious ways. Similarly uninspired are the song selections, all the most literal and obvious needle drops for any given moment: the \"Kill Bill\" music for an \"epic\" fight scene, \"No Sleep Till Brooklyn\" while the brothers are traveling through Brooklyn, \"I Need a Hero\" when Mario's learning to be a hero, and so on.\nIf you're a gamer or a parent, you're probably already going to see \"The Super Mario Bros. Movie\" regardless of what critics say, and you'll probably have enough fun with it not to feel disappointed. It's mediocre on more than few levels, but inoffensively so, and the fan service really works. As far as comedy-adventure movies based on games go, however, you'll have an even better time at \"Dungeons and Dragons: Honor Among Thieves,\" which excels at both the comedy and the adventure.\n\"The Super Mario Bros. Movie\" opens in theaters April 5.",

After playing with my sons \u2014 ages 19 and 28 \u2014 during the pandemic I\u2019ve still never gotten the allure of the cartoonish Mario and his brother Luigi. I prefer my games more realistic and more of the Madden football variety.\nBut they still toy around with it and 40-plus years of history says that the characters Mario (voice by Chris Pratt) and Luigi (Charlie Day) still hold sway over young ones and, obviously, some adults.\nFor those expecting an actual plot beyond the character\u2019s video game origins. Yeah, just don\u2019t.\nIt\u2019s fairly straight forward and graphically in tune with the games. The brothers get sucked into the Mushroom Kingdom and they have to save it and its leader, Princess Peach (Anya Taylor-Joy) from Bowser aka King Koopa (voice by Jack Black), a super-powered turtle.\nYup, that\u2019s the story.\nTo the filmmakers\u2019 credit, they throw in a lesson here and there about self-worth, self-confidence and family loyalty.

        "text": "Video game adaptations have been having a bit of a renaissance with bangers like Sonic the Hedgehog 2 and HBO\u2019s The Last of Us, so it\u2019s only natural for Nintendo to finally re-enter the ring with The Super Mario Bros. Movie. Surprisingly, The Super Mario Bros. Movie\u2019s opening feels rather reminiscent of Nintendo\u2019s first foray into the silver screen with Super Mario Bros. (1993), in that the latest iteration of the plumber\u2019s Mario features the iconic siblings living in Brooklyn, scraping by with prospect plumbing jobs that inevitably lead our heroes into the Mushroom Kingdom proper.\nGraciously, that\u2019s where the similarities end between the two films, as The Super Mario Bros. Movie takes a green pipe down straight to the source material and crams as many nuggets and Easter eggs as possible from Nintendo\u2019s storied history. With its brisk pace, The Super Mario Bros. Movie features a plot that feels like an amalgam of Super Mario Odyssey and Mario 64, both of which are excellent choices, as they exemplify the 3D era of the Mario franchise.\n\u201cThe Super Mario Bros. Movie features a plot that feels like an amalgam of Super Mario Odyssey and Mario 64\u2026\u201d\nAfter falling into the bowels of Brooklyn, the brothers unknowingly are transported to the Mushroom Kingdom after Luigi accidentally activates a green pipe, setting up the first half of the film, in which Mario vows to reunite with his brother after they get separated on their way down. Without delving too much into the rest of the plot, let\u2019s just say The Super Mario Bros. Movie does an excellent job of cribbing the best bits of some of the more iconic elements present in modern Mario games in its narrative.\nVisually, The Super Mario Bros. Movie is stunning and is probably the best thing about it. It transforms the already stellar and iconic source material and marries it with a more western cartoon aesthetic that feels wholly appropriate for an Illumination film that doesn\u2019t stray too far from Miyamoto\u2019s established aesthetic. Of course, The Super Mario Bros. Movie also happens to feature an all-star cast. Despite my reservations about many of the characters not having that over-the-top inflection that cartoon characters tend to have, The Super Mario Bros. cast makes up this deficit with solid acting and bravado.\n\u201cVisually, The Super Mario Bros. Movie is stunning and is probably the best thing about it.\u201d\nChris Pratt\u2018s Mario fits into that \u2018untested hero rising up to the occasion\u2019 archetype that echoes many of his past characters while also giving Mario a good jumping-off point (no pun intended) into the Goomba stomping, overall-clad hero we know and love. Charlie Day also masterfully morphs into the meek but willing Luigi, channelling his chaotic inner persona ala It\u2019s Always Sunny in Philadelphia, which ultimately helps create a solid foil for his older brother.\nThe two standout performances, however, would easily be Jack Black as Bowser and Anya Taylor-Joy\u2018s take on Princess Peach. The latter transforms an otherwise mostly blank slate of a character into a fierce Princess worthy of her royalty and a welcome departure from the literal damsel in distress archetype typical of the character. Jack Black, instead, not only portrays Bowser as the imposing threat that he is but adds that distinct musically charged oomph the famed actor is known for, transforming Bowser into a genuinely funny and entertaining antagonizing force.\nWhere The Super Mario Bros. Movie briefly stumbles is in its pacing. With a runtime of 1H 32M, the movie feels like it often rushes through set pieces as fast as possible. It makes sure to establish its cinematic universe in a way that only serves as teasers for future projects rather than scenes that give the audience more time to digest and appreciate what\u2019s on-screen.\nEven still, The Super Mario Bros. Movie mostly nails what it sets out to do while being appropriate for both fans of Mario\u2019s first outing on the original Nintendo Entertainment System and their children who may only be familiar with Illumination\u2019s other iconic series that starts with the letter M.",

        "text": "For some time now I\u2019ve said that after the success of the comic book hero translations that flood our theaters and TV screens, the next big source of filmed entertainment would be video games. They\u2019ve tried in the past, but the results weren\u2019t the best. Recent adaptations and success from The Witcher, to Sonic the Hedgehog, (and most recently) The Last of Us have proven that good content is finally being released unto the world. So, after the failure that was the 80s live action adaptation of Super Mario Brothers halted any further fruit from that tree, we finally have a new contender in entering into a world of decent adaptations\u2026and it\u2019s all gone backwards.\nBrooklyn plumbers Mario (Chris Pratt) and Luigi (Charlie Day) are struggling to get their new privately owned business off to a good start. When a massive water main break threatens to cause a lot of property damage to their beloved neighborhood, the brothers jump into action. If they can stop the massive flow of water from running, they will be famous. In trying to fix the problem, they find a hidden section of the sewers with a special green pipe that sucks them into another world.\nThey get split up along the way though, with Mario ending up in the lush and thriving Mushroom Kingdom, and Luigi ending up in the desolate and scary Dark Real. With the help of his new found friend, Toad (Keegan-Michael Key), Mario attempts to gain the aid of Princess Peach (Anya Taylor-Joy) to save his brother. She is already planning to head to the Dark Realm to stop the evil Bowser (Jack Black), and takes Mario with her to hopefully solve all their plans.\nThe Super Mario Bros. Movie is only 92 minutes long, but even trying to succinctly describe the plot in a simple summary is impossible as halfway through the movie they are still unfolding new parts of the plot. What technically is a simple story is just muddled in a massive knot of overstimulation. World building is left at the door giving way for the filmmakers to jam in every little piece of Mario lore they can into every single frame. Unlike any video game in the world where you play something you love and the sequel gives you what you love and adds to it; The Super Mario Movie took everything you loved and just threw it at the screen and hoped it worked.\nA walking, breathing clich\u00e9; The Super Mario Bros. Movie is more cringe than loveable nostalgia. Punctuated by a soundtrack sourced from Now That\u2019s What I Call a Movie Soundtrack! Vol. 67 CD they picked up at a local bargain bin, almost every joke lands flatter than level full of defeated Goombas. This is a kids movie. The jokes are not really meant for adults, but even those jokes don\u2019t work. I can count one little child chuckle that occurred for the entirety of the screening I was at.\nFor a kids movie, there is also a fair amount of content that didn\u2019t seem so kid friendly. Luigi\u2019s initial arrival in the Dark Realm was probably the one thing in the movie I enjoyed. The introduction to the Dry Bones and Shy Guys actually caught my attention, but didn\u2019t seem that fit for little children. As Luigi and other captives then sit caged above endless pits and lava, they are treated to the existential crisis of the gleeful Lumalee in another cage that is terrifying for adults and will confuse/confound young ones.\nLeading up to the release of The Super Mario Bros. Movie, it seemed the biggest worry fans had was Chris Pratt\u2019s delivery as the historic gaming icon. Most people thought it would just be Pratt\u2019s voice again and they didn\u2019t want that. He actually pulls out a nuanced Brooklyn accent and does fine for the role and should be the very last thing people should worry about in what is ultimately another failed attempt to translate what many would consider the birth of modern video game culture. Is it made for kids, yes. But that doesn\u2019t excuse reusing the same old jokes and set-ups that every other kid\u2019s movie has trotted out before. The Super Mario Bros. Movie needs to be sent down a pipe to a world no one else can access, and left there.\nFinal Grade: D\nCheck out more of Matthew\u2019s articles.\nHere\u2019s the trailer of the film.",

        "text": "Directed by\nStarring\nAnya Taylor-Joy Charlie Day Chris Pratt Jack Black\nIllumination + Nintendo. C\u2019mon, how bad could it be?\nCorporate entertainment at its most creatively bankrupt. It zips by, though.\nJustice for Bob Hoskins.\nNintendo and Illumination team up to give everyone's favourite fictional plumber an animated makeover, with soulless results.\nIt\u2019s fitting that The Super Mario Bros. Movie starts with a Minion in Mario Kart get-up. This glossy slice of kid-distracting entertainment comes from the meeting of two companies \u2013 Nintendo and Illumination \u2013 that hold sway over the hearts and minds of youngsters the world over. With the combined power of the colourful characters of the Super Mario universe and the dark arts of the studio behind Despicable Me, Sing, The Secret Life of Pets and, yes, Minions, it must surely be time to update a classic meme. Whereas in 2009 it was Nintendo\u2019s creative mastermind Shigeru Miyamoto and then-company president Satoru Iwata holding aloft their wildly successful DS console, now Miyamoto and Illumination CEO Chris Meledandri could stand alongside a poster for the film, grinning while declaring, \u201cIT PRINTS MONEY!!!\u201d\nIn seeking to eradicate the memory of Super Mario Bros., the notorious 1993 box office bomb that still serves as the worst-case-scenario for video game movies, The Super Mario Bros. Movie keeps it simple and plays it safe. Faithfulness and reverence are all the rage with console-to-screen adaptations, but unlike, say, The Last of Us, the Mario franchise has rarely prioritised storytelling. Instead, its visual encyclopaedia of characters and locations acts more as vibrant stage-setting for precise platforming perfection, with their elegantly-made games free of such fuss as lore and backstory beyond a back-of-a-cigarette-packet set-up. For going on 40 years, the magic of Mario has been in the joy of play.\nAnd so, this new film is remarkably slight, superficial, and short, too, running at barely 90 minutes long even with credits included. Its wafer-thin plot pits Mario (Chris Pratt), a hapless Brooklyn plumber teleported to the technicolor wonderland of the Mushroom Kingdom, against the power-hungry King Koopa, Bowser (Jack Black), who has seized a Super Star and is hellbent on burning the world to the ground and wooing Princess Peach (Anya Taylor-Joy) in the process.\nWhere other brand-exercise flicks like The Lego Movie or directors Aaron Horvath and Michael Jelenic\u2019s previous feature, Teen Titans Go! To the Movies, both found space to comment on the power and pomp of the properties themselves, The Super Mario Bros. Movie is disappointingly on-rails. The animation, too, is polished but not exceptional, cutting loose in some nicely-conceived sequences that lock the camera\u2019s perspective to a 2D side-scrolling plane, but otherwise trading in spectacle that can only approximate the rush of actually playing the Mario games.\nMostly, that means scenes depicting, for example, a mad dash through Mario Kart\u2019s Rainbow Road racecourse, or a head-to-head arena battle between Mario and Donkey Kong (Seth Rogen) that evokes Super Smash Bros., reminding us of the fun we could be having if we\u2019d decided to stay at home. At least there, we wouldn\u2019t have to live in fear of the film\u2019s incongruous pop-rock needledrops, from a training montage backed by \u2018Holding Out for a Hero\u2019, to a pimp-my-ride Kart-building scene set to the opening riff of AC/DC\u2019s \u2018Thunderstruck\u2019.\nWhat The Super Mario Bros. Movie lacks in imagination and creative flair, it makes up for in endless Easter Eggs, knowing references and cheeky cameos. It\u2019s a relentless barrage of iconography, pulling from the whole span of Mario history and even scraping the barrel of the Nintendo archive. Backgrounds are stuffed with such titbits, from sleek glass ornaments shaped like Pikmin, to bedroom posters idolising the vehicles and racers from F-Zero, to the photos and memorabilia that adorn every square inch of the so-called Punch-Out Pizzeria.\nMario himself owns a vintage NES console, which suggests that, in this world, Nintendo instead built its empire on the Kid Icarus franchise, while the plumber\u2019s ringtone is the distinctive plinky-plonk jingle that heralded the powering-up of the GameCube console. Elsewhere, composer Brian Tyler sets a record for motifs-per-minute as familiar musical themes penned by Nintendo legend Koji Kondo and his collaborators are crammed into the film\u2019s score.\nIt\u2019s what the studios want us to believe \u2018the fans\u2019 want, but, for this lifelong Mario devotee, it is nothing short of exhausting. These nostalgic pokes in the ribs only work as a calculated distraction from just how undercooked the film is. Beyond its whizz-bang pacing, dazzling sugar-rush colours and the odd Jack Black piano ballad interlude, all that The Super Mario Bros. Movie has to offer is its intellectual property, and it never convinces as anything other than a tidy opportunity to push both brand and product.\nSince the 1980s, Nintendo has built its reputation on gleeful, ingenious entertainment that delights in design.

        "text": "It\u2019s been nearly 30 years since Mario and Luigi hit the silver screen, and their long-awaited return has finally arrived. The Super Mario Bros. Movie is a collaboration between Minions creator Illumination and Nintendo. With The Big N\u2019s involvement, there were high expectations for this adaptation of the iconic plumber to be faithful to what fans love about the character, and The Super Mario Bros. Movie delivers on just that.\nWorld 1-1\nThe Super Mario Bros. Movie finds the titular siblings as aspiring plumbers, hoping to get a new business off the ground. However, it\u2019s not long before Mario and Luigi are sucked into a new universe and thrust into a mission to help protect Mushroom Kingdom. Right off the bat, The Super Mario Bros. Movie is jam-packed with easter eggs both large and small. Not just nods to Mario\u2019s deep library of games, but the entire Nintendo family. It\u2019s a movie that Nintendo fans will enjoy combing through to pick out every fine detail.\nI was impressed by how quickly I bought into the relationship between Mario and Luigi here, too. Sure, I\u2019ve been watching the brothers go on adventures together for my entire life, but having that relationship translate to the big screen isn\u2019t necessarily easy. Without too much flashing back, we get a strong sense of how Mario and Luigi have looked out for and protected each other over the years.\nWhile I (like everyone else) had legitimate concerns about Chris Pratt as Mario coming in, I found his performance to be perfectly fine. It didn\u2019t take me out of the movie as I feared it might, and I had forgotten he was the man behind the voice by the end. That said, Charlie Day\u2019s Luigi and Jack Black\u2019s Bowser really stood out to me. Jack Black in particular has a few moments that are some of the best in the movie.\nFollow the rainbow road\nThe Super Mario Bros. Movie does an excellent job at taking elements from the games and making them work in a new medium. The nods to Mario\u2019s platforming roots, and the use of the various creatures that have popped up through the franchise were exceptionally clever.\nArguably some of the best adaptations done in the entire movie is the way so many iconic Mario songs and sounds are brought to life in fun new ways. There were so many minor sound effects, like a block breaking or a 1-Up Mushroom being consumed, that put a smile on my face every time. The soundtrack felt like Nintendo was flexing its deep discography of instantly recognizable Mario tunes, with some great reimaginings from composer Brian Tyler.\nWhile the story doesn\u2019t take many big swings, it\u2019s able to ride on the backs of solid world-building and emotional character moments that I didn\u2019t see coming. The film would have benefitted from a few more of these moments.\nAlthough I didn\u2019t mind the story in a Mario film being pretty paint-by-numbers, it felt like we zipped through everything really quickly, speedrunning exposition and dashing from plot point to plot point. The way the movie fleshes out The Mushroom Kingdom and other locations within the Mario universe are some of the most fascinating parts of the movie, and I wish we got to spend more time doing that.\nI have to give The Super Mario Bros. Movie props for featuring some genuinely funny moments with clever gags and callbacks that had me chuckling in the theater. With Illumination at the helm, I was worried that it would lean on lowbrow Minions humor, but this is probably one of the funniest movies I\u2019ve seen from the studio. Illumination\u2019s expertise in animation is also on full display here, as the color and detail are truly something to marvel at.\nJump up, superstar!\nI walked out of The Super Mario Bros. Movie pleasantly surprised by how well this world and its characters translated to the big screen. Bringing all these characters to life in a way that feels authentic and doesn\u2019t alienate fans is no small feat, and you can feel the passion and love that went into making that happen. More than anything, I\u2019m optimistic about the future of Mario universe films and hope this isn\u2019t the last partnership between Illumination and Nintendo.\nThe Super Mario Bros. Movie was directed by Aaron Horvath and Michael Jelenic. The movie is available exclusively in theaters.\nThe Super Mario Bros. Movie\n- Solid world-building\n- Most of the humor works\n- Stellar soundtrack\n- Jack Black and Charlie Day are standouts\n- Heartfelt character moments\n- Packed with fun references and easter eggs\n- Story is rushed through\n-\nDonovan Erskine posted a new article, The Super Mario Bros.

        "text": "The Super Mario Bros Movie is out now in cinemas, and ahead of its release, reviews officially dropped.\nWhile more reviews will be published as critics who didn't get to see the movie ahead of time watch and review it, the ones already out paint a pretty mixed picture.\nSome reviewers love the relatively short length and the faithfulness to the games, while others see the film as an empty piece of brand synergy that doesn't have the space for any character depth.\nAt the time of writing, the film's Rotten Tomatoes score is 54% from 101 reviews, a slight uptick from its initial score below 50%.\nRelated: The Super Mario Bros Movie credit scene explained\nLet's see what the reviews have said.\n\"Given how badly fans took the 1993 film, it's a smart approach to have The Super Mario Bros Movie be almost entirely for the fanbase. It's absolutely stacked with Easter eggs from across all of the Mario series \u2014 including musical nods, visual gags and a couple of 2D platformer sequences, among other things.\"\n\"It's not subtle and makes the movie a series of 'hey, you remember this?' moments rather than an actual plot, but Mario fans won't be complaining.\"\n\"It's all quite fun, with a good sense of humor and a consistent computer-animated aesthetic \u2014 plus, at 90 minutes including credits, it's short, sweet, and over before anything can get annoying.\"\n\"But it's hard to escape the feeling, especially during the [...] Rainbow Road sequence, that you would probably be having more fun just playing a game together instead.\"\nRelated: Will Super Mario Bros Movie 2 happen?\n\"I was a bit surprised at how, sort of, unsurprising the movie is. At only 92 minutes, we don't have much time for anything outside the main plot. The filmmakers packed a lot of Nintendo in that short runtime, and they want to make sure we see all of it. So we only have time for the broadest of story beats. Mario wants to make his family proud; Peach wants to save her people; Donkey Kong wants to prove he\u2019s not just a meathead.\n\"It's very by-the-numbers hero's journey stuff. Not a complaint, just an observation. I'll say it again: This isn't The LEGO Movie.\"\nRelated: Charlie Day reveals which It's Always Sunny co-star could fit into Super Mario Bros\n\"As nice as it is to look at The Super Mario Bros Movie, it's not anywhere near as fun as it would be to play it. It's a-him, Mario, but it's no a-masterpiece. The storyline is only a touch above the interstitial bits of plot you usually get between gameplay.\n\"With the exception of Jack Black\u2019s grandly lovesick Bowser (he's part Phantom of the Opera, part Meatloaf-styled balladeer), there's nothing here that deepens these characters beyond their usual 2D adventures.\"\n\"Does The Super Mario Bros. Movie surpass said expectations? It doesn\u2019t, but it at least meets them halfway. The film moves forward on the bare minimum of structure, and chooses to make up for its shortcomings with an overabundance of reverent Easter eggs and worn '80s pop needle drops.\n\"It traffics hard in cuteness, as a defence against worthwhile criticism.\"\n\"As it's building toward its logical and very traditional Mario kind of ending, it uses every possible opportunity it has to make its various fantastical worlds feel like living, breathing, organic places that you'd want to spend hours exploring if they were parts of an open-world video game.\n\"It's cool as hell every single time someone's outfit transforms after they ingest mushroom power-ups, but it's things like being able to see each of the individual seeds on a fire flower's face flicking like a candle that really make you appreciate how hard the movie's working.\"\nRelated: The Super Mario Bros Movie directors defend Chris Pratt\n\"I'm shocked by just how terrible this effort is: a new Nintendo cinematic embarrassment for a generation that isn't old enough to remember/know about 1993's live-action Super Mario Bros.\n\"It's pleasant to look at, with animators directly translating the wonderful aesthetics of the source material to the big screen, but it fails to exercise even one inventive or clever idea. Instead, it functions more like a checklist of nods to the games than a narrative feature.\"\nThe Super Mario Bros Movie is out now in cinemas.",

        "text": "The Super Mario Bros. Movie (2023): Review\nThe Super Mario Bros. Movie features countless easter eggs set to a gorgeous score, but it unfortunately falls short whenever it needs to be an actual movie.\nI think a lot of people will give The Super Mario Bros. Movie a pass, simply because of the IP attached to it. Sure, the games that this film is based on may not have much of a story to them, but is that really a justification to not bother coming up with a substantial plot for this adaptation? Mario is a character that I have a lot of personal attachment to, I\u2019ve played almost all of his mainline platforming games, I\u2019ve raced with him, I\u2019ve played golf with him, and I even own several figures that probably cost me too much money. At the end of the day though, as I was watching Illumination\u2019s newest animated film, whilst I was absolutely enjoying the countless references and easter eggs in front of me, I couldn\u2019t help but wonder if that was all the film had to be. Why shouldn\u2019t we ask for more?\nThe Super Mario Bros. Movie makes what\u2019s arguably its biggest creative risk in the opening few minutes. Weirdly, the film decides to borrow from both of the previous Mario adaptations by having Mario (Chris Pratt) and Luigi (Charlie Day) start as human plumbers, working in Brooklyn. The two, whilst trying to make a name for themselves in the plumbing scene, find themselves sucked into a warp pipe and taken into the Mushroom Kingdom, where they\u2019re separated. Mario then meets Toad (Keegan-Michael Key) and Princess Peach (Anya Taylor-Joy) and the group decides to go and rescue Luigi from the clutches of the villainous Bowser (Jack Black). The plot is incredibly barebones, serving more as a vehicle for easter eggs and references rather than a way to tell an emotionally engaging narrative.\nNow, this is the point where you may ask me why exactly I think a kids\u2019 movie based on a video game needs an emotionally engaging narrative. Surely it\u2019s enough to just fill the 92-minute runtime with references to the games, throw in a few licensed tracks and easy one-liners and call it a day. The film makes no effort at all to hide the fact it\u2019s an advert.\nBefore the film played, the cinema I saw it at played an advert for the Nintendo Switch, and all of the Mario games on the console, and as the film went on, it made so much sense why they did that. Every single element of this film is there to get you to buy a Nintendo Switch game. Bowser\u2019s wedding costume is ripped from Super Mario Odyssey (2017), the power-ups are almost exclusively ones that can be found in Nintendo Switch games, and even the inclusion of Mario Kart feels like a way to get you to buy Mario Kart 8 Deluxe (2017).\nI care about all of this because movies have shown that you can actually make an advert for kids with a creative, emotionally engaging story, universal comedy, interesting characters and with exciting vocal performances. The Lego Movie (2014) was released just under a decade ago and was arguably even more of a blatant advertisement, but it was so much better than this because the filmmakers still tried. Sure, what they were making was a product designed to make money and sell toys, but they put their all into it and ended up with a genuinely heartfelt and brilliant movie. Arguably, they had even less to go off, as decades of Mario games definitely have a lot more story to them than some Lego bricks.\nWhen watching The Super Mario Bros. Movie, I couldn\u2019t help but feel like I was watching a studio on auto-pilot. Illumination is hardly an animation studio worth celebrating, but this movie might be their most safe and formulaic. It\u2019s a movie designed to make money, sell tickets and spawn thousands of YouTube videos about easter eggs that you missed. Donkey Kong (Seth Rogen) is in the film, and it honestly feels like he was included purely to set up an inevitable solo film, rather than be there because the filmmakers felt like they had something interesting to do with the character.\nThe sense of the whole thing being on auto-pilot also feeds into the voice acting. Surprisingly, Chris Pratt isn\u2019t the worst offender, delivering a performance as the titular hero that just feels flat compared to what we know he is capable of doing. Jack Black and Charlie Day are the two major exceptions, both fully committing to their characters and giving them more than the required energy, but they\u2019re unfortunately both criminally underused. It ends up unfortunately being Anya Taylor-Joy whose performance is the weakest. Her Princess Peach just sounds bored throughout the whole adventure, and it results in an often dull second half that struggles whenever she\u2019s placed into the forefront. It doesn\u2019t help that the film is surprisingly devoid of any real jokes, with a lot of the comedy being tame visual gags that struggled to get a laugh out of me.\nWith all that being said, the film definitely has its share of strengths. The score is gorgeous, with composer Brian Tyler working alongside Mario composer Koji Kondo to create beautiful orchestral themes that take tunes from the games and turn them into anthems worthy of the big screen. The score is so good, in fact, that it makes it consistently disappointing whenever the film decides to ditch it in favour of a licensed pop song, a choice which lets down a lot of otherwise great action sequences. Visually, the film can look gorgeous, going above and beyond anything Illumination has ever done before. The way otherwise dull locations are designed to look like they could be levels straight from the games is a very nice touch that helps give the movie a fresh and unique look.\nFinally, it\u2019s worth touching again upon the many references present in the film. If all you want out of this movie is an easter egg hunt, then it will absolutely fulfil that desire. Off the top of my head, I noticed callbacks to games such as The Wrecking Crew (1984), Kid Icarus (1986), and Punch-Out!! (1987). There\u2019s even a blink-and-you\u2019ll-miss-it cameo from the original Arcade game Donkey Kong (1981). It\u2019s a buffet of gaming easter eggs and callbacks, and whilst I don\u2019t think that\u2019s all a movie should be, if that is all you\u2019re looking for, you won\u2019t be disappointed. It also manages to set the stage perfectly for a potential Nintendo cinematic universe, which I would not be surprised to see appear over the course of the next decade.\nThe Super Mario Bros. Movie will probably be the biggest movie of the year, both in terms of box office gross and pop culture impact. I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll go on to spawn countless sequels, spin-offs and merchandise. However, when I walked out of the cinema, I couldn\u2019t help but be disappointed. Is this really all we want from our animation? I think films like The Lego Movie prove that it is possible to have the best of both worlds, for something to be an easter-egg-filled advertisement whilst also being a genuinely fantastic family film. So if we know it can be done, then why should we ever settle for less?\nThe Super Mario Bros. Movie is out now globally in theaters.",

        "text": "The Super Mario Bros Movie Review\n\"...does more to pay lip service to fans of the world's most famous plumber than establish a Nintendo movieverse.\"\nWhen I hear the words \"Super Mario Bros Movie\", I automatically picture the 1993 live action film starring Bob Hoskins and John Leguizamo as the iconic plumber brothers. The 1993 film was widely panned as one of the worst video game to movie adaptations ever made, earning nearly $8m less than what it spent on production. That was largely due to the script being full of cringey dialogue and awful design choices, including the Koopas being 9 feet tall with heads too small compared to their massive bodies. It was so bad, Nintendo planned on locking it in a vault so that not one pair of eyes could ever see it. Yes, the movie doesn't remotely resemble a Super Mario film, but at the very least, it has a story you can actually follow. The film starts with the brothers getting lost in the sewers and ending up in a parallel world covered in fungus, reigned over by King Koopa. In the 93' film, Dinosaurs have evolved into human-like beings and King Koopa wants to leave the fungi covered world he's in and invade the human world to turn human's into dinosaurs. With the help of Princess Daisy, the Mario brothers save the day, turn Daisy's dad fungus back into his old royal self, (lord knows where the writers got this idea from) so they can return home. Oh and Luigi falls in love with Daisy and wants to stay. It's a god awful script and isn't close to anything remotely Mario, but at the very least, it has direction, something which this new film is sorely lacking.\nThe first film in the newly established Nintendo Pictures library is one of the most anticipated films of the year and already more beloved and talked about by movie goers than the $2billion sequel to Avatar. This could be either because it's a decent looking animated Mario movie, that unlike it's cinematic predecessor, has been largely contributed to by the creator of Mario (Shigeru Miyamoto) and produced by Minion's creation studio, Illumination. Both companies separately have a long and illustrious catalogue of incredible work, but together are like two matching puzzle pieces. On the other hand, it could be because it's been nearly 30 years since we last saw a Mario film on the big screen and nostalgia runs deep, who knows? The most notable piece of information we had early on is that Mario would be voiced by Chris Pratt, which many believed was the wrong choice given that Chris Martinet is 1) still alive and 2) the actor many Nintendo fans already decided in their mind would take the part. Sadly however, Martinet in the title role isn't going to draw non-Nintendo fans to the theatres, so it is understandable why Nintendo would choose to go with Pratt instead. He's a box office hit that puts butts in seats. Plus, he's a naturally gifted comedy actor with almost masterful comedic timing and a lovable and charming personality. More importantly, he also has the experience at memorising and delivering long lines of dialogue in a stressful movie environment, which is something Martinet has never had to do in any of his previous outings as the voice of Mario.\nIt's because of Martinet's long history as the Plumber that many forget he wasn't the first voice actor in the role. Including Pratt and Martinet, there has been a total of 20 voice actors to take up the mantle across various forms of media, some providing a worse performance than Pratt could ever manage to muster. Like myself, many speculated that Chris Pratt would deliver an awful rendition of Mario, emphasised even more by the non-english language versions of Mario being so good, which in comparison are night and day to Pratt's performance. That aside, Pratt just about managed to capture Mario's vocalisms'. I was one of Pratts biggest critics going into the movie, as I was fairly sure that he would fall at the first hurdle to accurately portray Mario in the way fans of the series deserved. Unfortunately, Pratt slips in and out of his Brooklyn/Italian accented impression more than once, which was painful to listen to at times. Granted, he wasn't all bad but it certainly wasn't what I was hoping for. Ultimately, whilst I'm happy his impression wasn't as bad as the trailers led me to believe, Pratt wasn't the right choice for the role, and I would be only happy to see him brought back, provided he work on his Brooklyn accent a little more before a sequel emerges.\nThe same could be said for Rogen, who's one dimensional stoner performance is back. When I think of Donkey Kong, it's not a hippy stoner. It's time to be truthful with ourselves, Rogen has never been funny, he adds nothing to the role and brings down the tone with the same performance we've seen in his dozens of other terrible films. Meanwhile, Fred Armisen's attempt at Cranky is somehow painfully worse, as he tries to change up his voice, only making the character that much more annoying and unfunny. This is not a performance I was expecting of Armisen who is truly one of the best comedic actors of our generation. Thankfully, the rest of the cast do a much better job as Anya Taylor-Joy (Princess Peach) plays a likable female warrior princess, albeit a rather safe, low-key performance than I was expecting. Charlie Day plays the character of Luigi astonishing well, whilst the absolute standpoint was Jack Black as Bowser. Who once again shows that he is both a comedic and musical genius. Particularly in the second act, as he busts out a power ballad about how much he loves Princess Peach and in the very next scene, is back to portraying a menacing antagonist. It is just a shame that the script was lacking, as honestly I feel like if had they had more to work with, this movie would have been Black's greatest performance yet. The movie's main issue is it has no clear story direction and feels incredibly rushed, as it jumps from one scene to another without lending anything to the plot.\nInstead of trying to tell a story, the team shoehorned in as many easter eggs and nods to Mario games as they could, with 85 references, easter eggs and mentions in the films 92 minute run time. A choice most likely to ensure the movie gets a steady stream of constant woo's and cheers from the heavily filtered audiences of Nintendo gamers at live test screenings. Unfortunately, this form of lip service doesn't work when it comes to movie goers in general as many watch films to be taken on a \"journey of discovery,\" a line muttered by my film studies teacher so many times, it's been burned into my brain. I could sum up Nintendo's biggest film over and over with just one line; it's nothing but lip service. As harsh as that may sound, it can't be argued with. This film is supposed to be the start of Nintendo's move to transition their biggest IPs to the big screen, but when you spend the first half hour of a 92 minute film making zero moves to advance the characters or the story whatsoever, focusing more on the brothers lives in Brooklyn, it's hard to believe this isn't anything more than a movie to stroke somebodies ego. It's almost like they got lost trying to explain the Mario's origin story and forgot there's a movie and other characters to talk about, so like the night before an exam, they crammed the rest of the film onto the end without thinking about pacing.\nThe film introduces the antagonists first, as Bowser and the Koopa army invade the penguin kingdom looking for a super star. The opening sequence is quite humourous as the penguins launch an attack with snowballs, leaving Bowser completely unfazed as he burns the kingdom's ice wall down. This opening sequence is \"good\", mixing a measure of impending risk and comedy masterfully but just like the rest of the film, it's over before it needed it to be; as it immediately jumps straight to the Mario brothers, starting up their new plumbing business. The brothers are excited as they watch their new commercial which includes the Mario rap from the cartoons. Despite their clear passion for their new venture, the brothers are met with mockery by their family and their former employer, Spike, one of the movies continuous outright references to the games, as Spike (aka Foreman Spike), appeared in the first \"Mario\" game, Wrecking Crew which released in 1985. Determined to prove they have what it takes and desperate to prove everyone wrong, Mario leads Luigi to fix a broken Brooklyn water main at night. After the films third attempt at slapstick comedy, the brothers crash through a wall and into a hidden chamber in the New York City sewer system. Whilst exploring, Mario and Luigi inevitably get sucked into a green pipe that transports Mario to the Mushroom Kingdom and Luigi to the Dark Lands where he ends up as Bowser's prisoner, minus a few detours with references to Luigi's Mansion.\nThe movie quickly speeds up, jumping from one plot point to another without pause, feeling more like you're speed running through the latest Mario game. This is made worse by the fact the movie spends far too long on the first act, meaning the second act comes and goes in a heartbeat and by the third, I at least, lost all interest. This isn't to say the movie is without its charms. It's gorgeously designed art style, created by the folks at Illumination is an animated Rembrandt for the eyes. Every single frame feels incredibly polished and painstakingly rendered to the point of perfection and it's just a shame that such due care wasn't taken in regards to the script, story direction or voice narration. Whilst visually impressive, the film is ultimately lacking in substance. If this was a Mario game, I'd say it's lacking any discernible key feature that it makes worthy of a purchase.\nOverall, Super Mario Bros isn't good. Rather, it's bang average, playing homage to the game's and lore that came before it, whilst also completely missing the point of what a movie is supposed to be. Rather than erase people's memory of the 1993 rendition, the 2023 film takes the \"Hold my Beer approach,\" providing not just a terrible story, but somehow also being just as bland. There is a complete lack of direction, and although they've already teased a sequel, I'd rather they went back to the drawing board and redid the mess they made with this film first. Ultimately, The Super Marios Bros movie does more to pay lip service to fans of the world's most famous plumber than establish a Nintendo movieverse, and for anyone hoping that Nintendo was about to challenge the MCU for movie IP dominance, now probably feels like they've slipped on a banana peel, face first.\nThe Major is Editor in Chief at Gamesenquirer and a part-time Reviewer.\nYou can follow him on Twitter @Thee_MajorPain\nStay tuned to Gamesenquirer for more news and reviews!",

        "text": "The Super Mario Bros Movie Review\n\"...does more to pay lip service to fans of the world's most famous plumber than establish a Nintendo movieverse.\"\nWhen I hear the words \"Super Mario Bros Movie\", I automatically picture the 1993 live action film starring Bob Hoskins and John Leguizamo as the iconic plumber brothers. The 1993 film was widely panned as one of the worst video game to movie adaptations ever made, earning nearly $8m less than what it spent on production. That was largely due to the script being full of cringey dialogue and awful design choices, including the Koopas being 9 feet tall with heads too small compared to their massive bodies. It was so bad, Nintendo planned on locking it in a vault so that not one pair of eyes could ever see it. Yes, the movie doesn't remotely resemble a Super Mario film, but at the very least, it has a story you can actually follow. The film starts with the brothers getting lost in the sewers and ending up in a parallel world covered in fungus, reigned over by King Koopa. In the 93' film, Dinosaurs have evolved into human-like beings and King Koopa wants to leave the fungi covered world he's in and invade the human world to turn human's into dinosaurs. With the help of Princess Daisy, the Mario brothers save the day, turn Daisy's dad fungus back into his old royal self, (lord knows where the writers got this idea from) so they can return home. Oh and Luigi falls in love with Daisy and wants to stay. It's a god awful script and isn't close to anything remotely Mario, but at the very least, it has direction, something which this new film is sorely lacking.\nThe first film in the newly established Nintendo Pictures library is one of the most anticipated films of the year and already more beloved and talked about by movie goers than the $2billion sequel to Avatar. This could be either because it's a decent looking animated Mario movie, that unlike it's cinematic predecessor, has been largely contributed to by the creator of Mario (Shigeru Miyamoto) and produced by Minion's creation studio, Illumination. Both companies separately have a long and illustrious catalogue of incredible work, but together are like two matching puzzle pieces. On the other hand, it could be because it's been nearly 30 years since we last saw a Mario film on the big screen and nostalgia runs deep, who knows? The most notable piece of information we had early on is that Mario would be voiced by Chris Pratt, which many believed was the wrong choice given that Chris Martinet is 1) still alive and 2) the actor many Nintendo fans already decided in their mind would take the part. Sadly however, Martinet in the title role isn't going to draw non-Nintendo fans to the theatres, so it is understandable why Nintendo would choose to go with Pratt instead. He's a box office hit that puts butts in seats. Plus, he's a naturally gifted comedy actor with almost masterful comedic timing and a lovable and charming personality. More importantly, he also has the experience at memorising and delivering long lines of dialogue in a stressful movie environment, which is something Martinet has never had to do in any of his previous outings as the voice of Mario.\nIt's because of Martinet's long history as the Plumber that many forget he wasn't the first voice actor in the role. Including Pratt and Martinet, there has been a total of 20 voice actors to take up the mantle across various forms of media, some providing a worse performance than Pratt could ever manage to muster. Like myself, many speculated that Chris Pratt would deliver an awful rendition of Mario, emphasised even more by the non-english language versions of Mario being so good, which in comparison are night and day to Pratt's performance. That aside, Pratt just about managed to capture Mario's vocalisms'. I was one of Pratts biggest critics going into the movie, as I was fairly sure that he would fall at the first hurdle to accurately portray Mario in the way fans of the series deserved. Unfortunately, Pratt slips in and out of his Brooklyn/Italian accented impression more than once, which was painful to listen to at times. Granted, he wasn't all bad but it certainly wasn't what I was hoping for. Ultimately, whilst I'm happy his impression wasn't as bad as the trailers led me to believe, Pratt wasn't the right choice for the role, and I would be only happy to see him brought back, provided he work on his Brooklyn accent a little more before a sequel emerges.\nThe same could be said for Rogen, who's one dimensional stoner performance is back. When I think of Donkey Kong, it's not a hippy stoner. It's time to be truthful with ourselves, Rogen has never been funny, he adds nothing to the role and brings down the tone with the same performance we've seen in his dozens of other terrible films. Meanwhile, Fred Armisen's attempt at Cranky is somehow painfully worse, as he tries to change up his voice, only making the character that much more annoying and unfunny. This is not a performance I was expecting of Armisen who is truly one of the best comedic actors of our generation. Thankfully, the rest of the cast do a much better job as Anya Taylor-Joy (Princess Peach) plays a likable female warrior princess, albeit a rather safe, low-key performance than I was expecting. Charlie Day plays the character of Luigi astonishing well, whilst the absolute standpoint was Jack Black as Bowser. Who once again shows that he is both a comedic and musical genius.

It is just a shame that the script was lacking, as honestly I feel like if had they had more to work with, this movie would have been Black's greatest performance yet. The movie's main issue is it has no clear story direction and feels incredibly rushed, as it jumps from one scene to another without lending anything to the plot.\nInstead of trying to tell a story, the team shoehorned in as many easter eggs and nods to Mario games as they could, with 85 references, easter eggs and mentions in the films 92 minute run time.

        "text": "The road to Illumination's The Super Mario Bros. Movie has been a long and winding one. Originally announced in 2018 before the reveal of the much-discussed voice cast in 2021, we have long been unsure as to whether Mario's big-screen debut (ahem, of the animated kind) was going to do the venerable gaming icon justice. Well, we now have our answer and it is just as we expected: The Mario Movie is a sufficiently fun time so long as you're not all that fussed about story.\nSo what exactly is the story? Mario (Chris Pratt) and Luigi (Charlie Day) are going about setting up a plumbing business in Brooklyn, New York, but the going is tough. Their clients are few and far between and their parents are disappointed, but hey, at least they have each other, right? You'll want to remember that bit, it's important.\nThrough a turn of events that we won't dive too deep into here in case we should slide down the wrong pipe and land face-first in a steaming pile of spoilers, the brothers are pulled into a mysterious world and immediately separated (see? We told you it was important). Mario lands a kingdom of the mushroom-y variety, populated by adorable Toads (a particularly squeaky Keegan-Michael Key) and overseen by the generally adored Princess Peach (Anya Taylor-Joy). Luigi finds himself in a land of lava streams and genuinely creepy Shy Guys, ruled by the scaled fist of the King of the Koopas himself, Bowser (Jack Black).\nWhat follows is rather typical of a Mario game: Bowser is after Peach, Mario is after Bowser, Luigi gets sidelined \u2014 it's nothing that we haven't seen before. Perhaps it's the case that this should not be a criticism of the film itself. The games aren't all that big on story, so why should we expect more from a big-screen adaptation?\nUnfortunately, games and films are not too similar beasts, and with an action-filled yet satisfying narrative seemingly being held in another castle, The Super Mario Bros. Movie is forced to rely on its other features to keep you entertained. These other elements do a decent job of keeping your eyes busy throughout the brisk 92-minute runtime, but the spectacle doesn't quite make up for the lack of real substance at its core.\nStill, that spectacle is quite something. Starting with the obvious, this film is a dream for anyone who has ever wanted to see the world of Mario brought to life with higher fidelity. Directors Aaron Horvath and Michael Jelenic have ensured that the Mushroom Kingdom is absolutely jam-packed full of references to just about every Mario game available, and Illumination's signature squishy animation does a good job of presenting all of this in a colourful, pleasing way. When one confused Toad asks, \"What are we supposed to do? We're adorable!\", you can't help but agree.\nEach location is a further feast for the eyes, as the animation house has clearly taken the time to work out the intricacies of 'the Mario style' and brilliantly realise it onscreen.\nMario aficionados will be picking up nods and cameos left, right and centre, from the obvious callbacks to Mario's signature run or side-scrolling action style, down to the more obscure Nintendo references (Pikmin fans, keep your eyes peeled). But this isn't to say that these will be a distraction for you if you have never picked up a Mario game in your life. The Mario movie is safe, sometimes to its detriment, but this means that you are never going to be left scratching your head just because you don't know the intricacies of Nintendo's history.\nThis clear love for the source material carries through into Brian Tyler's superb score \u2014 undoubtedly the star of the show (which is saying something when you consider the fact that there is a literal star in this one). Taking on Koji Kondo's original and iconic themes at every given opportunity, Tyler's score is rich with the history of the franchise. Many of us had heard the grand orchestral arrangement of the main theme in the first trailer, but the true gems lie in how Tyler manipulates short motifs into the score at any given moment from instantly-recognisable item sounds to snippets of the Luigi's Mansion theme.\nOf course, serving up opportunities to deploy Nintendo's most famous earworms is the film's huge (perhaps too huge) cast of characters. Rounding out the main team that we mentioned above, Seth Rogan's Donkey Kong lends an enemy-turned-friend trope to the film, while nothing could have prepared us for quite how much screen time Fred Armisen's Cranky Kong would receive. All of the voice cast is, for the most part, perfectly fine. Black certainly relishes the role more than most and we were pleased to find that Pratt's vocal talents do not necessarily make or break the film after swiftly palming off the Martinet legacy voice in the opening minutes.\nWith a cast of main characters this large, and multiple shoutouts (musical or otherwise) hitting you square on every minute, The Super Mario Bros. Movie does suffer from some pacing issues. Squeezing everything possible into a swift hour and a half, while refreshing, means that more nourishing principles like setup and payoff take a backseat to breakneck speed. Matthew Fogel's script is full to the brim with quips and funny asides, but the level of hand-holding does grow tiresome as the film enters the final act and we still find characters explaining to us what is happening on screen instead of trusting us to work it out.\nThe opening act is undoubtedly the best, taking its time to introduce us to our heroes before plunging them into peril; but as time ticks on and more and more pieces are added to the puzzle, the action becomes a cycle of 'the characters find themselves in a tricky situation, they immediately get out of it'. We imagine that future sequels (which seem near-certain) will be given the chance to sit with their characters for a little, thus removing the need to sideline some for the benefit of others.\nNone of this is to say that The Super Mario Movie necessarily bites off more than it can chew, more that it is struggling to spit out any cohesive sentences through its mouthfuls of Nintendo history and decades' worth of Mario in-jokes.\nConclusion\nWith more references than we needed and less plot than we deserved, The Super Mario Bros. Movie is perhaps everything that you would expect it to be. Directors Horvath and Jelenic have managed to bring the Mushroom Kingdom to life in ways 8-bit Super Mario veterans never could have imagined, even if the vision does get a little overstuffed in the process. That being said, the cast of familiar faces, Tyler's clued-in score, and the sheer amount happening in every frame were enough to keep us engaged from start to finish and we are curious to see what lap two inevitably brings.\nPlease note that some external links on this page are affiliate links, which means if you click them and make a purchase we may receive a small percentage of the sale.

        "text": "The Super Mario Bros Movie review: Gameplay is king\nWhat do we want from a Super Mario Bros movie? Clearly, not what we got in 1993: a live-action cringe-fest with Bob Hoskins and John Leguizamo respectively in the roles of plumbing twins Mario and Luigi, and Dennis Hopper as King Koopa.\nIncredible casting, sure \u2013 but the film was a box office bob-omb and has been widely derided, setting the benchmark as the first of its kind for a host of limp live-action video game adaptations in its wake. It\u2019s been notoriously difficult to craft a successful one. Here we are 30 years later still struggling to hit on a successful formula (a handful of wins aside).\nAs is often the case, however, attitudes soften with the passage of time. Of the kids who\u2019ve grown up to remember the film when it was released, many look back on it fondly. It\u2019s a camp curiosity, and it\u2019s of its time.\nThe 1993 movie is pioneering, even, in terms of its significance in Tinseltown\u2019s transition from practical to digital effects. This all makes for, at the very least, an intriguing chapter in Hollywood\u2019s back catalogue.\nThe Mario Bros return\nThe damage done, it\u2019s taken three entire decades before a renewed attempt at a movie starring the Italian multipotentialites (if you\u2019ve played the games, you\u2019ll know these guys have more strings to their bows than an expert archer with, um, lots of strings) gears up to hit the screen.\nFast forward to 2023, then, and a fresh bash at creating Mario movie magic is nigh. This time, sidestepping live-action altogether (once bitten and all that) to bring the film closer to its tonal and gameplay roots via an animated offering.\nChris Pratt and Charlie Day are on Mario and Luigi duty (not without its own controversy), lending their voices to the titular plumbers. Anya Taylor-Joy brings her succulent tones to Princess Peach. Seth Rogen is a barrel of laughs as Donkey Kong, Jack Black bombastic as Bowser, and Keegan-Michael Key as fun guy (sorry) Toad.\nWhat\u2019s The Super Mario Bros Movie about?\nSo, what\u2019s The Super Mario Bros Movie about? Well, the Mario brothers are living in Brooklyn with their extended family when they decide to start their own business in the plumbing trade, and put out a commercial.\nWhen the ad attracts a customer, they couldn\u2019t be more delighted. However, the job goes disastrously awry. And so the movie sets up two enthusiastic and endearing \u2013 but largely inept \u2013 central characters.\nMeanwhile, Bowser is exerting his control over in Mushroom World \u2013 starting with the Penguin King (Khary Payton) and his people. When circumstances conspire to send Mario and Luigi to the Mushroom Kingdom, so begins an adventure in which the brothers are separated and, well, you can probably guess what happens next. Mario teams up with Princess Peach, Toad, and, yes, Donkey Kong, to save Luigi and stop Bowser. Yada yada yada.\nGameplay is king\nIf that makes it seem as though the film is boring, it isn\u2019t. Predictability is an element of so much movie fare, especially when it\u2019s formula-driven like this. No, there\u2019s enough here to keep entertainment levels up to an adequate level \u2013 even if it does cater primarily to the younger market. But adequate means there\u2019s potential here for so much more.\nThe Super Mario Bros Movie is committed to incorporating in-game elements to give it a gameplay feel, and that\u2019s getting to the nub of its issues. While moments where Mario, Toad, et al are acrobatically negotiating platforms, pipes, and Bullet Bills flow nicely and might give you a cheap thrill, equally, they can feel forced. Especially when you\u2019ve got a coin or other punch box thrown in.\nThis all works more convincingly in animation over live-action, of course, and when it comes to the gameplay aspects, the Mario Kart-inspired racing sequences work best of all. They more naturally transfer to the movie screen. The car chase, after all, is a classic of cinema. We\u2019re reminded sharply, however, of the age-old conundrum of how best to adapt a video game for moviegoers.\nThe approach here \u2013 leaning heavily into the game franchise\u2019s platform and racing elements \u2013 can be jarring. It sacrifices narrative immersion for the sake of gimmicks. And anyway, watching these moments is always less thrilling than doing it yourself. When compared to recent video game adaptation winners, the Sonic the Hedgehog films, it\u2019s easy to see where The Super Mario Bros Movie stumbles. And why the Sonics might be the best example to date of movies based on a game that gets the balance right.\nIf music be the food of emotional investment\u2026\nThe film\u2019s soundtrack nevertheless makes smart use of songs. Bonnie Tyler\u2019s \u201cHolding Out for a Hero\u201d, A-ha\u2019s \u201cTake on Me\u201d, and AC/DC\u2019s \u201cThunderstruck\u201d (perhaps catering to the parents in the audience) are seeded amongst music and sound effects lifted from the game.\nSubscribe to our newsletter for the latest updates on Esports, Gaming and more.\nThese songs and the accompanying sequences add a sense of cinematic scale and, importantly, fun. In these moments, the action really motors and our emotional investment in the film soars.\nActing up a storm\nPratt and Day are perfectly fine as Mario and Luigi, and neatly circumnavigate the Italian accent debate in ways that will become clear when you see the film. Anya Taylor-Joy, too, works. But it\u2019s Jack Black as Bowser who really delivers, issuing a vocal performance that brings something extra to the character. Under Black\u2019s influence, Bowser is odious and narcissistic, yes, but he\u2019s also vulnerable. If you\u2019ve never before wondered what makes Bowser tick, you will now. You\u2019ll immediately want to delve into his backstory.\nThe character of Princess Peach, meanwhile, pockets a more progressive role than in the games. It\u2019s admirable, and it also works well. She\u2019s switched from the damsel in distress to a resourceful woman of the people. She will protect the Mushroom Kingdom at all costs and takes a lead role in Luigi\u2019s rescue.\nKeegan-Michael Key makes an enthusiastic Toad, while Seth Rogen voices a Donkey Kong with something to prove, reluctantly aligning with Mario for the greater good. All of these characters have enough about them to warrant spin-offs should the so-called Nintendo Cinematic Universe choose to go down that (Rainbow) road.\nA hint of something edgier\nMeanwhile, humour is generally light, inoffensive \u2013 and also forgettable. The film focuses on plot, tone, and stuffing itself full of game references over proper lols.\nThat said, the characterisation of Luma specifically is inspired. The blue star-like creature isn\u2019t in it much but speaks to those of us who might tire quickly of the film\u2019s tweeness, imprisoned as Luma is in a cage, apparently suffering an existential crisis.\nLines where the little blue floaty guy talks, for example, about the infinite void, feel like they\u2019ve come from a much edgier version of the film. One that many of the adults in the audience would surely love to see.\nThe Verdict \u2013 Is The Super Mario Bros Movie good?\nThis is a serviceable animated movie adaptation that is entertaining enough but it won\u2019t set your world alight.\nIts focus is on stuffing in gameplay-style sequences that don\u2019t always feel at home in a movie alongside cameos and references designed to please the fans. And while its tone is light and amiable enough, charm and humour take a knock because, simply, it tries too hard to pander.\nHowever, young kids will love its fast-paced story and video game sound and visuals, while there\u2019s the odd touch like the existentially contemplative Luma and Jack Black\u2019s brilliantly morose and sociopathic Bowser that will do it for older audience members.\nThe Super Mario Bros Movie review score: 3/5\nWith Easter Eggs and video game references galore, fans of the video games and Nintendo generally will love spotting all the cameos and other nods buried throughout \u2013 and there\u2019s just enough here to keep older audiences entertained while the kids have a ball.

        "text": "Super Mario Bros. Movie, The (United States/Japan, 2023)April 06, 2023\nIt\u2019s bright, colorful, overflowing with energy, and possesses a story so basic that even the most inattentive viewer will have no trouble following along. I think my 3 \u00bd-year old daughter would love it. Older viewers may enjoy the jolt of nostalgia that The Super Mario Bros Movie gives because, after all, this isn\u2019t really a film; it\u2019s a 90-minute commercial designed to remind people of all the great times they once had playing Mario (and Donkey Kong) games. On that level, it\u2019s a passable motion picture, but one can\u2019t help but wonder whether this represents a missed opportunity. Imagine if The Super Mario Bros Movie had been more like The LEGO Movie than The Angry Birds Movie. With all apologies to co-directors Aaron Horvath and Michael Jelenic (Teen Titans GO!), consider what might have been if Phil Lord & Christopher Miller had been in charge.\nThis is 100% fan service. Some will argue that\u2019s a good thing. Others will be on the other side of the fence. I understand the value of stuffing a product with Easter Eggs and references, but I can\u2019t help but wish that some of the time and creative energy devoted to the dazzling visuals had been expended on the writing. If someone could be found with no previous recognition of the name, they would likely say this is one of the most idiotic, nonsensical animated movies ever made. Such a person may not exist (and it\u2019s certainly not me \u2013 I have spent more hours than I care to admit playing these games) but it\u2019s an indication of how heavily the movie\u2019s success relies on the brand surrounding it.\nThe story opens in Brooklyn, where brothers Mario (Chris Pratt) and Luigi (Charlie Day) have sunk all their money into a cheesy TV commercial to promote their foundering plumbing business. When attempting to fix a manhole leak, the brothers discover a strange pipe that proves to be a gateway to the Mushroom Kingdom. After being sucked into the pipe, they are separated with Luigi going the Dark Lands, which are ruled over by the evil Bowser (Jack Black), while Mario meets Toad (Keegan-Michael Key), who takes him to Princess Peach (Anya Taylor-Joy). With Bowser coming on a mission of conquest (and intending to marry the princess, with whom he is smitten), Peach decides to form an alliance with the Jungle Kingdom. In order to do that, however, King Cranky Kong (Fred Armisen) decrees that Peach\u2019s champion, Mario, must defeat the Jungle Kingdom\u2019s champion, Donkey Kong (Seth Rogen), is an arena battle.\nPlayers of the different Mario Brothers/Donkey Kong games will recognize various faithful recreations of levels. One of the best of these is a cart race on the rainbow road. And, although there are some notable character absences (the future appearance of one is hinted at in a post-credits scene), the ones who are present are rendered in ways that won\u2019t disappoint even the most meticulous Mario fan. The voices, on the other hand, may cause some displeasure. Neither Chris Pratt nor Charlie Day opts for an accent (except during the plumbing commercial) and the generic American accents sound flat. Jack Black\u2019s Bowser is at times too nasal and Seth Rogen makes no attempt to disguise his voice so Donkey Kong sounds like, well, Seth Rogen.\nThe animators went to great lengths to accurately represent (and expand upon) some of the places found in the various video games. No one familiar with any of the Mario games will have any trouble identifying the Mushroom Kingdom. Illumination, the company behind the Despicable Me and Minions features (among many others), has spent money on this movie and it shows. One of the biggest problems with the derided 1993 Super Mario Brothers is that it looked cheap; that\u2019s not the case here. Early in the movie, there\u2019s a subtle nod to the side-scrolling approach of the early games and references like that one continue throughout.\nStill, by sticking so close to the look and feel of the source material, The Super Mario Bros Movie comes across as something more desirous of being played than watched. I could see this adventure being great fun if approached with game controller in hand. Sitting in a movie theater, however, I found myself wanting more, as if I was only getting part of the experience. But The Super Mario Bros Movie is not intended to work in the same way that conventional films do. It\u2019s not about cinematic enjoyment; it\u2019s about expanding a brand. As such, it will make a lot of money, spawn sequels and spin-offs, and become another extension of a commercial feedback loop.\nSuper Mario Bros. Movie, The (United States/Japan, 2023)\nCast: Chris Pratt, Charlie Day, Anya Taylor-Joy, Jack Black, Seth Rogen, Fred Armisen, Keegan-Michael Key\nScreenplay: Matthew Fogel\nCinematography:\nMusic: Brian Tyler\nU.S. Distributor: Universal Pictures",

        "text": "Although some seek to reappraise it as misunderstood, Nintendo would like to leave their live-action 1993 Super Mario Bros. movie in the past. The initial adaptation of the beloved game series was such a critical and commercial bomb that it made Nintendo swear off the major motion picture business for the foreseeable future. Enough time has passed and now Nintendo is ready to dip their toes back into adapting their properties for non-interactive media, starting once again with their biggest IP. A collaboration between animation juggernaut Illumination\u2019s Chris Meledandri and series creator Shigeru Miyamoto, there\u2019s a considerable amount of anxious hype for 2023\u2019s The Super Mario Bros. Movie. Fear not, as the team behind Mario\u2019s second go at a theatrical feature nail it with all the grace of a perfect speedrun of the original game.\nBy far the biggest eyebrow-raiser when the ball got rolling on The Super Mario Bros. Movie was the casting of Chris Pratt as Mario. On paper, his casting and the prioritization of celebrity voice actors over veteran voice talent don\u2019t bode well. Thankfully, Pratt steps into the role with his recognizable charm. His affable, though clumsy, Brooklyn plumber is about as good an adaptation of the character as you can hope for, albeit trading in the high-pitched voice from the games for a more classic Brooklyn accent. Charlie Day as the loving, fear-prone brother Luigi is even better. Right from the onset, as these two struggle to get their burgeoning plumbing business off the ground, they\u2019re swell adaptations of the most iconic duo in gaming, lovingly translated into another medium. One can immediately see the great care that was taken, and that\u2019s before we enter the Mushroom Kingdom.\nOn a particularly tough job, Mario and Luigi get sucked into a portal via a mysterious pipe, getting separated. Mario is spit out in the Mushroom Kingdom, a gorgeous world populated by Mushroom-like Humanoids known as Toads ruled over by the benevolent Princess Peach, played by Anya Taylor-Joy injecting Peach\u2019s requisite grace with a bit of spunk. Emphasis on gorgeous, as this is in the upper tier of American animation. Under directors Aaron Horvath and Michael Jelenic (Teen Titans Go!), the Mushroom Kingdom is a lush world, bathed in near-photorealistic lighting that stupendously highlights the lively character designs. Much like the plumbers themselves, it seems like Horvath and Jelenic took the task of retaining the iconic nature of the settings and upping the ante for the cinematic canvas to heart.\nThe rest of the locales fare just as well, including, but not limited to, the wild jungles of the Kong Kingdom, the fiery rock of Bowser\u2019s floating castle, and the frigid Ice Kingdom. Moreover, none of the \u201cvideo game-yness\u201d of the locations is lost for so-called realism. Power-up blocks and obstacles abound! The rich worlds are populated by a myriad of wacky creatures. Jack Black is clearly having the time of his life and relishing the chance to play the big bad villain Bowser, who holds Luigi captive and sets his sights on the Mushroom Kingdom to ask for Peach\u2019s hand in marriage. Keegan Michael-Key is pitch-perfect as firecracker sidekick Toad and it\u2019s a real treat to hear Seth Rogen and Fred Armisen steal a variety of scenes as Donkey and Cranky Kong, respectively.\nThe script from Matthew Fogle takes Mario on an unbelievably entertaining tour through these worlds and characters at a breakneck pace. Running at 93 minutes, that pace can often feel constraining, allowing less time for moments to breathe with characters who are well-developed enough to deserve those moments. Action is prioritized, which isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing whenever the action sequences land this well. Some of the most exhilarating action set pieces this side of The Adventures of Tintin and Puss in Boots: The Last Wish, The Super Mario Bros. Movie captures the momentum and the moment-to-moment obstacle avoidance of the Nintendo games in such sequences as Mario and Peach training on a makeshift course, a show-stopping smackdown with Donkey Kong, and a climatic Kart Race that plays with gravity in clever ways.\nThen there\u2019s the \u201cIllumination\u201d of it all. Although The Super Mario Bros. Movie mostly trusts in the story it\u2019s telling, it can\u2019t help but slip in some of the most grating hallmarks of the House of Minions. There are a couple of moments where those phenomenal action sequences are interrupted for cheap slapstick, or rude humor creeps its way in. The worst offenders by far are some head-scratching needle drops of popular music. Who needs to hear \u201cHoldin\u2019 Out for a Hero\u201d in an animated movie again, or any movie for that matter? And what exactly does AC/DC have anything to do with Mario or Nintendo? This is especially off-putting when the score for the film by Brian Tyler already beautifully weaves in the original game themes by Koji Kondo. It takes one out of the world of the movie and bows to the worst trends of family-oriented animation.\nNevertheless, that\u2019s more of a misstep than a game over. The Super Mario Bros. Movie is clearly made by people who love and understand the enduring appeal of the video games, with plenty of unobtrusive easter eggs serving as little mini-movies in and of themselves. What The Super Mario Bros. Movie is not, however, is solely a nostalgia trip. The iconic plumber\u2019s big screen re-do is a proud celebration of the character\u2019s appeal. With jaw-dropping visuals, a highly entertaining voice cast, and an adventurous spirit, The Super Mario Bros. Movie levels up the video game adaptation to heights only dreamed of by wide-eyed kids playing the original video game back in the \u201880s. Touch\u00e9, Nintendo.",

        "text": "For me and so many millions of players around the world, the Nintendo brand means something. In our hearts, it holds a place akin to the one Disney holds for others. And, importantly, it\u2019s earned that place not just by being a massive corporation whose name is emblazoned across so many of the games we grew up with, but because those games so often possess a rare and defining quality, something uniquely \u201cNintendo.\u201d It\u2019s hard to articulate just what that quality is, but it has to do with inventiveness and charm, joy and wonder, beating within the heart of its excellent, meticulously designed games. I\u2019d hoped that The Super Mario Bros. Movie, on which Mario\u2019s creator, Shigeru Miyamoto, has co-producing credit, would capture some of that magic.\nUnfortunately, while the film dutifully goes through the motions, sweating to put as many nostalgic references on screen as we can swallow, there\u2019s no real inventiveness or spirit here. It has the makings of a rousing adventure, but not the crackle of inspiration. The end result is a transparently hollow commercial product that feels like it was designed in a lab to make our brains light up with recognition for things we love, without actually reminding us why that love exists in the first place.\nRead More: Super Mario Movie Sounds Shockingly Good, Or Pretty Bad Depending On Who You Ask\nI won\u2019t be spoiling the film\u2019s plot here, in part because there really isn\u2019t much of a plot to spoil. Trailers have revealed that we do, at least briefly, see the titular bros in Brooklyn before circumstances whisk them away to the Mushroom Kingdom. What then ensues feels less like a story unfolding and more like a series of video-gamey action sequences calculated to provide the filmmakers with maximum opportunity to show us signifiers that make the Nintendo faithful (a group in which I absolutely count myself) go \u201cOoh, it\u2019s that power-up/enemy/gameplay mechanic I like!\u201d\nPlayStation 5 God of War Ragnar\u00f6k Bundle\nDisc version\nBundle includes PlayStation 5 console, DualSense Wireless Controller, Base, HDMI Cable, AC power cord, USB cable, God of War Ragnar\u00f6k full game voucher\nThis is not a film that feels like it came into being because Nintendo or its creative partner, animation studio Illumination, finally hit upon a Super Mario tale worth telling. It feels like it came into being because some suits determined (rightly, no doubt) that now was the time to expand Mario\u2019s media profile well beyond games, to get more people coming to the theme parks, buying the consoles, seeing the movies, snagging the official merch, and generating revenue in any number of other ways.\nAnd of course, many good films are also part of multi-pronged corporate strategies to collect more golden coins than you can count. That\u2019s not the issue. The issue is that that\u2019s just about all The Super Mario Bros. Movie is.\nNow, it\u2019s not entirely without its charms. The always-reliable Jack Black brings an energy (and a singing voice) to his role as Bowser that this otherwise pretty lifeless movie can scarcely contain. Likewise, among Princess Peach\u2019s Mushroom Kingdom subjects is a Toad commander who imbues lines like \u201cGood luck, Princess, for all our sakes\u201d with such exaggerated gravitas that they become enjoyably ridiculous. And there\u2019s a Luma\u2014a cute, starry little creature\u2014that plays against expectation, wishing, in its whimsical voice, for the sweet release of death. It makes for some of the film\u2019s only genuinely surprising moments, generating some real laughs.\nFor me, though, the most surprising thing about the Mario movie might be how much it feels like a video game, in a negative sense. Throughout the action sequences, which see Mario working alongside Peach to assemble a force capable of taking on Bowser\u2019s might, his success in this situation or that one often comes down not to some particular ingenuity on his part, but to him getting an effective power-up. And again, it\u2019s not that I\u2019m against seeing Cat Mario from Super Mario 3D World make an appearance in the movie. I love 3D World! I love Cat Mario! But the film could have worked these details into action scenes that also felt rooted in character and made victory feel earned, rather than simply the result of video-game happenstance.\nRead More: Every Super Mario Game Ranked From Worst To Best\nAnd the way the film segues from one sequence to another is almost comically mechanical, clearly the result of the film fulfilling its obligation to show us more Stuff From The Games rather than originating in any organic way out of the story. Case in point: Cranky Kong (Fred Armisen, doing a kind of New York old guy accent with a dash of Bernie Sanders to it) at one point declaring, \u201cWe\u2019re gonna need karts!\u201d ushering us into a sequence that\u2019s just one visual nod to Mario Kart 8 after another, complete with Mario doing a drift boost. Just like we do in the game! Isn\u2019t that cool?\nSuch game references aren\u2019t just the stuff of the central action here, either. Many scenes feature blink-and-you\u2019ll-miss-\u2019em nods to not just Mario, but a host of older Nintendo games. An early scene, for instance, takes place at Punch-Out Pizzeria, a Brooklyn eatery bedecked with Punch-Out!! protagonist Little Mac\u2019s boxing paraphernalia, as well as photos of other bruisers from Nintendo\u2019s pugilistic franchise. At one point, the film was so dense with these little background details that I wondered just how it is we\u2019re supposed to watch a movie like this: paying attention to what\u2019s actually happening, or constantly scanning the background for Easter eggs.\nAnd again, I think that a density of visual information in a movie can be great. The layers of visual detail in the wonderful animated film Into the Spider-Verse make its world feel fully realized, and help the film reward repeat viewings. It\u2019s just that there\u2019s no substance in The Super Mario Bros. Movie to support all that background detail in the first place, so it just becomes one more way for the film to trigger the positive nostalgic receptors in our brains without actually earning our interest or admiration. One inspired exception: During a particularly low moment, Mario retreats to his room and plays the NES game Kid Icarus. When he dies (like many early Nintendo games, Kid Icarus is ruthless), the game\u2019s death screen text, \u201cI\u2019M FINISHED!\u201d, serves as a humorously apt commentary on Mario\u2019s mental state.\nTo its credit, the film looks great. From the individual hairs in Mario\u2019s mustache to the eye-popping vistas of the Mushroom Kingdom, it\u2019s a visual treat. I just wish it all felt like it was in the service of something more substantial than a corporate brand-building exercise. Chris Pratt, Anya Taylor-Joy, and the rest of the cast are all serviceable but unremarkable, and I feel like that\u2019s largely because the film makes no real demands of them. Sure, it\u2019s nice that Princess Peach here is cool and competent and not relegated to being the damsel in distress that she has been in so many Mario games, but she\u2019s still a shallow archetype with only the vaguest gestures at actual character development.\nThis movie will no doubt make tons of money, and kids may really like it. If I\u2019d seen it when I was seven years old, I probably would have been dazzled. But kids and adults deserve better than this, and if Nintendo and Illumination hope to launch a new series (or perhaps even a universe) of Mario movies, they\u2019d better start doing more than just lighting up our brains with nostalgic recognition for details from the video games we\u2019ve played and loved. They\u2019d better figure out how to actually make us feel invested in these characters and what happens to them. It\u2019ll take more than a ride along Rainbow Road or a well-timed tanooki suit to do that.",

        "text": "In hindsight, the cultural response to The Super Mario Bros. Movie has been very strange. A viewer who paid no attention to the hype would come to the theater with much more realistic expectations. Unshockingly, the film is a straightforward family-friendly adventure packed to the rafters with callbacks and references. It has its upsides, but the film knows its audience and sees no reason to reach beyond it.\nThe Super Mario Bros. Movie comes to the big screen courtesy of the much-maligned Illumination Studios. The directing duo of Aaron Horvath and Michael Jelenic was previously best known for Teen Titans Go!. The thing the directors have in common with the studio is that their primary creative output is both hilariously profitable and widely despised.\nWhen Illumination inked the deal with Nintendo to bring Mr. Video Game to the big screen for the second time, fans immediately declared the death of the franchise. The studio has made a variety of animated projects, but their biggest contribution to the cultural discourse is and will always be the shrieking yellow Rabbid-rip-offs known as the Minions. When the ensemble cast was announced, reactions varied from hysterical laughter to solemn depression. However, when the trailers started to show off the film's admittedly excellent animation and mostly solid voice acting, those hoping to have fun at the film's expense had to put aside their bingo cards. Against all odds, hype began to build and fans began wondering whether the film might bring something new to the Mario franchise. Both the early doomsaying and the recent excitement were vastly overblown.\nHow's the movie? So utterly by the numbers that the most interesting thing about it is still the fan reaction it created. The plot follows Mario and Luigi, enterprising plumbers from Brooklyn who quit their steady gigs to strike out on their own. This is the deepest delve into the Bros.'s home life ever put to screen. Fans meet Mario and Luigi's parents, and their extended Italian-American family, and see their lives as mundane everyday plumbers. After a disaster, they fall down a hole, discover a big green pipe, and get forcefully fired into the Mushroom Kingdom. In one of the film's most ill-advised decisions, Luigi is captured by Bowser, leaving Mario to spend most of the runtime saving his brother's life. Mario will have to learn the rules of the new world, partner with the self-sufficient Princess Peach, and defeat a series of game-inspired physical challenges to get to Bowser.\nThere are two questions that any viewer will have to answer before determining whether they'll enjoy this film. Are they a fan of the Super Mario Bros. franchise or Nintendo games in general, and are they under the age of 12? If they check both boxes, this'll probably be their new obsession. If they're just a kid, they'll likely become a Mario fan. If they're an adult Mario fan, they'll probably get a few hits of nostalgia and enjoy the ride. But, anyone who isn't a child or a Mario fan won't get much out of this film. Illumination is only looking to make new fans if those fans are also new to the concept of movies. Parents will probably have a decent enough time, but there's better stuff out there when it comes to fun for the entire family.\nThe Super Mario Bros. Movie has some obvious strengths. It's visually immaculate, with an immense amount of detail and a constant stream of beautiful images. The animators at Illumination don't always deliver jaw-dropping material, but this is easily the best-looking film ever to come out of the studio. The music is generally solid, with a lot of charming orchestral rearrangements of classic Mario mainstays. The film also drops in a couple of 80s pop classics, which are out-of-place, but tolerable. The voice acting is mostly great. Jack Black's Bowser is even better than the trailers made it seem, complete with a musical number. Charlie Day's Luigi is fun, Keegan-Michael Key's Toad is charming, and Anya Taylor-Joy's Peach just sounds like Joy's normal voice, but it fits. Veteran voice actors Khary Payton and Kevin Michael Richardson shine like diamonds in their small roles, demonstrating why stunt casting big names has become so unpopular among fans. And, of course, Chris Pratt's Mario is fine. Like the rest of the movie, it's not great, but it's not as bad as people thought it would be.\nThe Super Mario Bros. Movie isn't going to break any new ground, but it is almost certainly going to make a lot of money. The \"video game movie curse\" has always been nonsense, but the original Nintendo hero headlining a decent kid's movie should finally shut the claim down for good. The Super Mario Bros. Movie will be a favorite of many children this year, it'll bring a smile to many longtime fans' faces, and it'll largely be forgotten by everyone else. Mario made it to the flagpole again, enjoy the victory music.\nMORE: The Super Mario Bros. Movie Has An Important Post-Credits Scene",

From the title you probably already know if you're inclined to see it, and in truth I've not angle enough to persuade you otherwise. It's flat, not quite lifeless, more two-dimensional than many of the videogames it borrows from. It's saved not with a memory card but a single performance, but that's not enough to make it worth recommending as the same skills are on display in other, more entertaining, fare. \n The 1993 outing (Super Mario Bros.) is two words shorter and 12 minutes longer and a glorious, trippy, failure. It adds more to the weird canon of Nintendo movies than this one does, as do corporate hagiography  Tetris  and 1989's The Wizard. In and among this film's numerous references to other pictures I found myself thinking of another videogame movie, the weird recursive exercise in nostalgia that was  Ready Player One . \n If you want a movie that gets video games,  Wreck-It Ralph  is right there, and better. If you want a movie based on a game there are dozens of execrable examples but the execution and excitement of  Dungeons & Dragons  put it front and centre. If you're looking for a movie heavily beholden to a Nintendo property with the character's name in the title then  Detective Pikachu  is streets ahead. If your feet are tapping while waiting for me to get to a point then the  Sonic  movies (both of them) are likely to be more for you. \n Jack Black's Bowser, giant fire-breathing turtle thing, is the best thing about this. That's mostly because he's a capable character actor, using his voice as another instrument in his array. While someone else plays the piano, his channelling of Elton John (and maybe Sammy Hagar) in plaintive paean Peaches is genuinely entertaining. The piano is branded Ludwig Van Koopa though and that's one of many 'jokes' that feel crowbarred. Bahamutt for Yamaha would have been a seven star reference, but Steinwario would actually have made sense. The only thing I got from the presence of Beethoven was not reminiscence of rondos or sonatas but poor Alex DeLarge being forced to watch. \n Chris Pratt (it's a him as Mario) and Charlie Day (set-theory troubling Luigi) are alright. Even with an adorable baby Mario flashback they spend most of the film apart. I could not have told you that it was Anya Taylor-Joy voicing Princess Peach if it hadn't told me on screen, nor that Keegan-Michael Key was the voice of Toad. It was evident though that Seth Rogen was voicing Donkey Kong because however weird the Eighties elements and Karting [sic] segments were, that laugh of his is signature. \n The action starts in a version of New York that has a Punch Out Pizza Parlour with a French restaurant called Chasse Du Canard (Duck Hunt). Mario has a Nintendo Entertainment System with a copy of what I think was Kid Icarus. The Mario Bros. Plumbing Co. advert appears to show the two of them 'flying' at the World Trade Centre. \n Other details included posters referencing playing cards. That's notable as Nintendo got their start printing Hanafuda, cards that can be used for a variety of games with images of various flora and fauna, though they're usually known as 'flower cards'. That their latter fortunes are based on cards through Pokemon is neatly circular. \n The film is perhaps more lazily so. Its post-credits sting might be cribbed from 1998's  Godzilla  but that's not the only reference. The piece Battle Without Honor or Humanity that featured in 2000's film New Battles Without Honor Or Humanity before being lifted by Tarantino for  Kill Bill Volume 1 . Other frequently over-used musical cues include ELO's Mr Blue Sky (1977,  Eternal Sunshine Of The Spotless Mind ), Bonny Tyler's Holding Out For A Hero (1984, Footloose), Thunderstruck (1990,  Iron Man 2 ) and A-Ha's Take On Me (1984). \n That last perhaps the oddest, as unlike the montages that accompany the other three (wonder, platform training, gearing up) there's no real reason for it on-screen. There's maybe a sense that Donkey Kong Country is a place where an Eighties guy can thrive, but that appears to extend to casual littering and a grotesque disregard for vehicular safety. Shells of various colours aside, one does wonder if their Karts are less powered by rainbows than by something containing tetraethyl lead. \n Tetra meaning 'four', of course, important to that other recent Nintendo movie but also here as direction credits. Aaron Horvath, Michael Jelenic, Pierre Leduc, and Fabien Polack. That's Teen Titans alumni, and two Illumination animation department staff. Animations a complex act but this has the feel of committee, to return to the various Eighties dangers more Joe Camel than horse (power). Writer Matthew Fogel has previously penned a prequel (Minions: The Rise Of Gru) and two sequels ( The Lego Movie 2 , Big Mommas: Like Father Like Son) and while those three would technically constitute adaptations under Academy rules the struggles here feel different. \n Some of it's time. I'm probably not the target audience for this, but damned if I can figure out who is. It's brightly coloured, and loud, but maybe too scary for those who'd enjoy the first two uncritically. I enjoyed spotting eggs, Easter or otherwise, but to no good end. It moved along well enough, but I didn't feel engaged. Some sequences seem solely there for 3D conversion, and some appear to be gameplay trailers for titles I don't want to play. There's maybe mileage in finding each of its allusions but even for those nods The Super Mario Bros. Movie is one to nod off to. \n There are some weird crowbarred motivations, there is at least one screenwriting manual that requires major characters have an arc but like an ill-timed jump many of these fall short. Online streaming is full of opportunities to watch people play videogames, but those offer commentary even when they're not done well. I counted six or seven appearances of the phrase \"Mamma Mia!\" but the ABBA song I kept thinking of was \"Take A Chance On Me\". Mostly as I wished I hadn't. \n Reviewed on: 19 Apr 2023 \n \n Share this with others on... \n \n \n Delicious \n \n \n Digg \n \n \n Facebook \n \n \n reddit \n \n \n StumbleUpon \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                            The story of The Super Mario Bros. on their journey through the Mushroom Kingdom.\n                         \n \n \n \n \n Director:   Aaron Horvath ,  Michael Jelenic ,  Pierre Leduc \n Writer:  Matthew Fogel \n Starring:   Chris Pratt ,  Anya Taylor-Joy ,  Charlie Day ,  Jack Black ,  Kevin Michael Richardson ,  Khary Payton \n Year:  2023 \n Runtime:  92 minutes \n BBFC:   \n \n Country:  US, Japan \n \n \n Festivals: \n \n \n Search database: \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Home \n Films \n DVD \n News & Features \n Contact Us \n \n \n \n \n \u00a92006-2023 Eye For Film.

        "text": "After waiting almost 40 years for Nintendo to make a Super Mario Bros. movie that looks and feels like the games it\u2019s based on, it took all of 40 seconds to realize it\u2019s going to be a mess. The film begins with Bowser, the King of All Koopas, arriving with his followers to take over a kingdom of penguins. War is imminent and it\u2019s at this moment that \u201cBattle Without Honor or Humanity,\u201d popularized by the Quentin Tarantino movie Kill Bill, starts playing. \u201cOh no,\u201d I wrote in my notes, knowing if this supposedly kid-friendly video game movie was going to use such an adult, misplaced, and obvious piece of music this early, there was a good chance it might have a crisis of identity. Ninety minutes later, those worries were more than validated.\nBased on characters that have existed for almost half a century, The Super Mario Bros. Movie was not made for anyone who has been alive long enough to remember any of that. It pretends like it is, occasionally throwing a nostalgic wink into the set decoration, but the bulk of the movie is disarmingly straightforward, with characters who barely learn anything, and stakes that never elicit even a hint of emotion. Everything happens randomly. There are very few explanations or instances of context. It\u2019s just lots of bright colors with characters entering and exiting the movie like they\u2019re running across a game screen. From its very first scenes, it\u2019s clear The Super Mario Bros. Movie is made for children.\nWhich is fine! And when you look at who made it, this totally tracks. The film is a collaboration between Nintendo and Illumination, the company behind Despicable Me, Sing, and The Secret Life of Pets. Illumination has a glistening box office record, but not quite the critical acclaim of some of its animation contemporaries. This is the studio that made billions on movies about little yellow Minions that speak gibberish. And once you think of The Super Mario Bros. Movie like that, it makes more sense. It\u2019s a movie made with an elementary-school level of story, character, theme, and humor because that\u2019s what Illumination does.\nThis is, admittedly, what much of the audience who goes to see it, and their families, will be looking for. You just would\u2019ve hoped, with a legacy property that\u2019s so beloved by so many, the team behind it, which includes directors Aaron Horvath and Michael Jelenic plus writer Matthew Fogel, would\u2019ve aspired to more. A balance, perhaps, between childlike wonder and emotional resonance. Instead, the film goes all-in on the former and resorts to haphazardly throwing lots of old-school Easter eggs into the background to appease long-time fans. (That said, there is some super fun stuff thrown into the background, even if it adds literally zero to the story itself.)\nThat story follows two brothers named Mario and Luigi (voiced by Chris Pratt and Charle Day, respectively) who have decided to leave their day jobs and start their own plumbing business. Very quickly though (probably too quickly), Mario and Luigi decide it\u2019s not going well and attempt to fix a dangerous leak as a desperate attempt to drum up good favor in the community. That\u2019s when, buried deep below New York City, they stumble upon a warp pipe and get sucked into it. Along the way, the brothers are split up. Luigi finds himself in a land run by the evil Bowser (voiced by Jack Black) while Mario arrives in the much more friendly Mushroom Kingdom. There, Toad (Keegan-Michael Key) explains to him his brother is in danger, so Mario asks the leader of the Mushroom Kingdom, Princess Peach (Anya Taylor-Joy), to help him get his brother back. And so, with the help of Donkey Kong (Seth Rogen) and others, Mario, Peach, and the gang show down with Bowser to save Luigi and the Mushroom Kingdom.\nThat description makes the film sound much more complicated than it is. There are a handful of interesting ideas in there, such as the brothers striving for independence and even a little riff with their parents, but most of those things are mentioned and then forgotten about. Depth and theme are not the goals here. Instead, the movie is focused on over-the-top antics that showcase as many different landscapes as possible, as quickly as possible. It\u2019s all in an attempt to make us believe the seemingly normal Mario is a heroic savior. And how does a nobody become somebody in the movies? With montages, of course. And montages mean music.\nWhat starts with the Kill Bill song ends up turning into a non-stop jukebox of pop and rock hits of decades past, songs like \u201cThunderstruck\u201d by AC/DC, \u201cHolding Out For a Hero\u201d by Bonnie Tyler, and others. All of these are great songs on their own, but in the context of a kid\u2019s movie where a plumber saves his brother by flying around as a raccoon, each song works against the film, reminding us we\u2019re watching a film that\u2019s uninterested in being reverent to its source material and is instead more than happy to be mediocre and disposable. The aim, one imagines, was to tickle that nostalgia for the adults in the audience who played Super Mario Bros. as children. But the disconnect between the music and the story ruins any chance of that happening. Instead, every time a new song comes on, the film sinks into another level of disappointment.\nThat\u2019s especially enraging because, beyond the pop songs, the The Super Mario Bros. Movie music by composer Brian Tyler is often a highlight. It\u2019s used to great effect in moments sprinkled throughout the film that are so good and inspiring, they almost make the rest of the film worth it. Moments where the camera dollies across the screen like the original Super Mario games, or follows behind like the more recent games, combined with beautiful, orchestral versions of the game\u2019s iconic music, working together to transport you decades into the past where you\u2019re sitting in your living room, in front of the TV, with a controller in your hand. Moments that remind you why this movie was made in the first place and the potential that has been, and will continue to be, largely wasted. As Mario runs and jumps around blocks and platforms, on enemies, and up and down pipes, you can\u2019t help but wonder why the whole movie isn\u2019t like this. These scenes show a clear understanding and love of the franchise. Why are these few short moments so good while the rest is so flat and uninteresting?\nThe answers are numerous. Because the story never deviates from its point-to-point structure. Because the characters, with the exception of Mario, are one-note without a meaningful arc. And because, all throughout, the film falls over itself to work in as many jokes, settings, and references as possible as a way to stretch the story into a length suitable enough to be called a movie. In that aim, it succeeds. The Super Mario Bros. Movie is definitely a movie, but it very rarely gives us the joy the games it\u2019s based on do, because we just can\u2019t connect to it in any meaningful way.\nOddly, none of this is the fault of the impressive voice cast. In addition to Pratt, Day, Taylor-Joy, Key, Rogen, and Black, it also includes Fred Armisen, Sebastian Maniscalco, Kevin Michael Richardson, and even the original voice of Mario, Charles Martinet. So much was made of these character voices before the film was released\u2014but once it starts, you can tell each actor is doing the best they can with what they\u2019ve been given. It\u2019s just that they\u2019ve been given a bunch of lines that are supposed to be funny, but very rarely are. Not even Rogen\u2019s signature laugh can convince you what\u2019s happening is funny.\nMaybe the biggest sin of The Super Mario Bros. Movie though is all of this is wasted on a movie that is stunningly beautiful. Every nook and cranny, down to the threads in Mario\u2019s hat, is presented in exquisite, eye-popping, detail, creating a world that you absolutely want to spend more time in. Actually, now that I think about it, the movie might work even better if you could mute it, pause, and zoom around its designs. At least then you\u2019d have a personal reaction to it. As it stands now, The Super Mario Bros. Movie is a visually striking, wholly uninteresting, and bland film that not even a few moments of magic can save. It\u2019s not as awful as the 1993 live-action film, but that\u2019s such a low bar, you don\u2019t need a power-up to cross it.\nThe Super Mario Bros. Movie is in theaters April 5.\nCorrection: An earlier version of this review misspelled composer Brian Tyler\u2019s name. io9 regrets the error.\nWant more io9 news?

        "text": "Super Mario Bros. is a delightful animated film that is perfect for kids. The animation is stunning, and the characters are unique and likable. Nintendo has learned from its past mistakes and has created a film that captures the magic of the games. The film is a nostalgic romp for adults and a fun time for children. However, it is also safe and lacks major creative risks.\nThe script by Matthew Fogel is filled with enough humor and references to keep the audience engaged. The directors, Aaron Horvath and Michael Jelenic, have delivered some inspired sequences. However, the film is trapped in a nostalgia castle due to the whims of an aging corporate dinosaur.\nThe film follows Mario and Luigi, two Brooklyn plumbers who are transported to the Mushroom Kingdom. Luigi is captured by Bowser\u2019s minions, and it\u2019s up to Mario and Princess Peach to save him. Bowser has plans to either marry Peach or take over the kingdom.\nThe film bombards the audience with an endless series of references from the start. Longtime Nintendo fans will delight in seeing all the nostalgia fodder deployed. The filmmakers show off plenty of visual flair, like an early scene in Brooklyn that rotates into a 2D chase sequence. However, some of the musical choices could have been more creative.\nWhile Super Mario Bros. lacks major creative risks, it accomplishes its goal of entertaining children. It is not a waste of time like other awful kids\u2019 films with ugly animation and production design, lazy writing, and zero creative vision.\nIn conclusion, Super Mario Bros. is a fun and entertaining film that captures the magic of the games. It may lack major creative risks, but it accomplishes its goal of entertaining children. It is a nostalgic romp for adults and a fun time for children.",

        "text": "Since 1993, Hollywood has produced about 50 big-budget video game movie adaptations. And as a lifelong gamer, I\u2019ll be the first to admit most of them suck.\nEven the video game movies that do well at the box office (Lara Croft: Tomb Raider, Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time) fail to capture that \u201cspecial something\u201d that made the games worth adapting.\nHollywood\u2019s ability to screw up can\u2019t-miss video game adaptations knows no bounds. The 1994 Street Fighter movie didn\u2019t bother to include any actual street fights.\nBut the 1993 Super Mario Bros. movie is hands down the genre\u2019s worst offender. The folks behind the 1993 film took the joyful world of Super Mario Bros. and transformed it into a gritty dystopian hellscape. Super Mario Bros. was a commercial and critical failure that lowered expectations for every video game movie that followed.\nAnd now, right when Hollywood is finally starting to produce video game movies worth seeing, along comes The Super Mario Bros. Movie, which looks like a pixel-perfect recreation of the classic Mario games. So is The Super Mario Bros. Movie the Mario movie gamers have craved for decades, or another soulless cash grab preying on the series\u2019 loyal fan base?\nCo-directors Aaron Horvath and Michael Jelenic\u2019s The Super Mario Bros. Movie stars Chris Pratt and Charlie Day as Brooklyn\u2019s finest plumbers, Mario and Luigi. When the film begins, the brothers quit their day jobs to launch their own plumbing company. They have no experience running a business and zero clients, but they won\u2019t let that stand in the way of chasing their dreams.\nOne fateful night while out on a job, Mario and Luigi stumble through a magical pipe that warps them into another world called the Mushroom Kingdom, a strange fantasyland inhabited by a friendly race of mushroom people.\nAn evil warlord named Bowser (Jack Black) wants to take over the realm, and marry the mushroom people\u2019s ruler, Princess Peach (Anya Taylor-Joy). Being an evil tyrant and all, Bowser captures Luigi and threatens to crush anyone who stands in his way.\nBefore he can return home, Mario joins forces with Princess Peach and a plucky little side-kick named Toad (Keegan-Michael Key) to rescue his brother and end Bowser\u2019s reign of terror.\nLet\u2019s get this out of the way. From top to bottom, the film\u2019s cast does a solid job embodying these iconic characters. I\u2019ve been playing Mario games since the \u201880s, and the cast mostly sounds like I always imagined these characters speaking.\nWhen the movie\u2019s trailer first dropped, fans lost their minds because Mario didn\u2019t sound like a borderline offensive Italian caricature (as he\u2019s portrayed in the later games). I won\u2019t spoil how, but the film addresses Mario\u2019s over-the-top accent early on, and I\u2019m more than fine with this decision.\nThe Mario I grew up with was always a gruff-sounding Brooklynite. In fact, it was the 1996 game Super Mario 64 that popularized the idea Mario sounded like your dad\u2019s impression of Chef Boyardee. Don\u2019t believe me? See the proof here and here.\nI got a kick out of Day\u2019s skittish take on Luigi, who is every bit the beta to his take-charge older brother. I wish the film expanded on this dynamic, treating Luigi like Ringo Starr to the heroic Mario\u2019s Paul McCartney.\nThe Super Mario Bros. Movie clocks in at a tight 90 minutes, and as much as I enjoyed the film, it could use some more meat on its bones. Horvath and Jelenic borrow from the J.J. Abrams school of filmmaking, where there\u2019s always a lot going on, but nothing meaningful happens.\nThe film is jam-packed with action and adventure but light on character and oddly enough, world-building. The movie jumps from one thrilling setpiece to the next, hoping you don\u2019t realize how thinly-sketched the characters are.\nIf you\u2019ve never played a Super Mario Bros. game keeping up with everything the film throws at you will require some Wikipedia deep dives. Even though the film introduces lots of colourful characters and fantastic locations, it barely establishes who these characters are and how they fit into this world.\nMario begins the movie as a courageous do-gooder with a heart of gold and ends the movie as a courageous do-gooder with a heart of gold. He\u2019s never forced to overcome the crippling self-doubts that all legendary heroes struggle to overcome \u2014 it\u2019s like Rocky starting the movie with the confidence of a guy who already knocked out the world champ.\nThe Super Mario Bros. Movie avoids most of the pitfalls that ruined its 1993 predecessor. Whereas Super Mario Bros. went out of its way to distance itself from its whimsical video game origins, this movie is a beat-for-beat recreation of the popular games. In fact, The Super Mario Bros. Movie clings so close to the games\u2019 look and feel that its lack of originality took me out of the experience.\nTony Soprano once called \u201cremember when,\u201d the lowest form of conversation. And so much of this movie is just a callback to Mario games. I love that this movie celebrates classic games like Punch-Out!!, Donkey Kong, and Mario Kart, but I need it to do more than play like a highlight reel of Nintendo\u2019s greatest hits.\nThe problem here is how film adaptations handle translating video game mythology versus video game mechanics.\nThe Super Mario Bros. Movie stays faithful to the source material by honoring gameplay mechanics from beloved Mario games. So viewers watch Mario do lot\u2019s of leaping between platforms, smashing bricks, and consuming mushroom power-ups.\nBut the ultimate Mario movie will place just as much emphasis on the series\u2019 mythology \u2014 exploring the characters, their world, and its history. I want these films to remain true to the games while also building on the source material in inventive ways. Think Battlestar Galactica, Freaky, and It Chapters 1 and 2.\nWhy do I need to sit through a ten-minute Mario Kart-inspired action sequence when I have more fun playing Mario Kart on my couch? If they want to stand out, these adaptations must spice up their successful recipes with delicious new ingredients.\nI\u2019m being hard on this film because it comes so close to delivering the Mario story I\u2019ve waited my entire life to see. The Super Mario Bros. Movie is a fun time at the multiplex for fans and newbies alike. But a fun time at the theatre is too low of a bar for a character of Mario\u2019s stature.\nThis film has the right tools to make good on this cursed genre\u2019s untapped potential. It\u2019s funny, heart-warming, and bristling with charm. And also the front-runner for the year\u2019s most gorgeous animated movie. But too often The Super Mario Bros. Movie comes across as a paint-by-numbers adaptation. It applies a proven formula to recreate a pixel-perfect reimagining lacking imagination.",

        "text": "Review: \u2018The Super Mario Bros. Movie\u2019 is okey-dokey\nApril is the cruelest month, breeding lilacs out of the dead land, mixing memory and desire, stirring dull roots with spring rain. But it is also, if I check the clock, Mario Time.\n\u201cThe Super Mario Bros. Movie,\u201d with its vistas of primary colors, is here to brighten our dreary springs, T.S. Eliot be damned. That there is a swell of enthusiasm for a Mario Bros. movie is a once-unthinkable development. The last time Mario hit the big screen was in the little-remembered 1993 live-action film with Bob Hoskins as Mario, John Leguizamo as Luigi and Dennis Hopper(!) as Bowser. Hoskins called the experience \u201ca f\u2014\u2014\u2014 nightmare.\u201d\nBut a lot has changed in the three decades since \u201cSuper Mario Bros,\u201d the very first video-game adaptation. A once widely derided genre is now a cash cow. \u201cThe Last of Us\u201d is a massive success on HBO. Pok\u00e9mon and \u201cUncharted\u201d are box-office hits. With Sonic the Hedgehog already two movies in, Mario is playing catch up.\nAnd \u201cThe Super Mario Bros. Movie,\u201d which opens in theaters Wednesday, is a spirited and sprightly attempt to race to the front of the pack. A collaboration between legendary video-game designer and Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto and Illumination founder Chris Meledandri (both producers), it\u2019s a drastically more sincere effort to capture the fun and spirit of the Nintendo game.\nAnd visually, it\u2019s a dream. Directors Aaron Horvath and Michael Jelenic and their animators have rendered the Mario universe with cartoony splendor, matching the game\u2019s ingenious simplicity with a more robust and equally delightful day-glo palate. If part of the appeal of playing \u201cSuper Mario Bros.\u201d and its many offshoots has always been to be immersed in such a sunny imaginary world \u2014 plus the bouncy earworm compositions of composer Koji Kondo \u2014 the movie has successfully mirrored that mushroom-stomping pleasure. It makes you ... want to play Mario.\nThat\u2019s because as nice as it is to look at \u201cThe Super Mario Bros. Movie,\u201d it\u2019s not anywhere near as fun as it would be to play it. It\u2019s a-him, Mario, but it\u2019s no a-masterpiece. The storyline is only a touch above the interstitial bits of plot you usually get between gameplay. With the exception of Jack Black\u2019s grandly lovesick Bowser (he\u2019s part Phantom of the Opera, part Meatloaf-styled balladeer), there\u2019s nothing here that deepens these characters beyond their usual 2-D adventures. Mario may be a modern-day Mickey Mouse but his kingdom is on the console.\n\u201cThe Super Mario Bros. Movie\u201d begins much like Spike Lee\u2019s \u201cDo the Right Thing\u201d: in a Brooklyn pizza parlor. There Mario (Chris Pratt, passable despite the outcry) and Luigi (Charlie Day) are struggling to get their plumbing business off the ground. There are a few moments of stereotypical Italian life \u2014 pasta and a big family dinner \u2014 before the brothers\u2019 attempt to fix a water main break drops them through a portal and into the fantasy realm of the game. (In future Brooklyn-set sequels, Mario will presumably combat waves of strollers and hipsters.)\nOn the other side, Bowser lords over a Koopa Troop army in scenes that can feel like the most surreal imitation yet of \u201cTriumph of the Will.\u201d But while shrinking or enlarging are possible on this other side of the green pipe, there\u2019s never any mention of the possibility of lives being lost as Mario makes his way through mushroom patches and question-mark boxes. His predicament is just as clear as in the game: He\u2019s been separated from Luigi and he must help save Princess Peach (Anya Taylor-Joy) from being forced to wed Bowser.\nGame logic often dictates Mario\u2019s movements. The shells of the turtle-like Koopas can be slid around like ammo. And choosing a Mario Kart vehicle is just as difficult a decision. Sometimes, the overlap is less consistent. An invincibility star is the most sought-after item in this adventure, greatly exaggerating its typical usefulness. Those things last for like 10 seconds.\nNone of this is likely to be enough for anyone to exclaim \u201cOh, yeah!\u201d while hopping up and down and doffing their cap. But it is an hour and a half\u2019s worth of superlative marketing that will whet your appetite for more Mario back home on the couch. If anything, the \u2014 as Mario would say \u2014 \u201cokey dokey\u201d \u201cSuper Mario Bros. Movie\u201d only reinforces the distance between two wholly different mediums. It may be game-on for video-game adaptations but the Mario main event is still back on Nintendo.\n\u201cThe Super Mario Bros. Movie,\u201d a Universal Pictures release, is rated PG by the Motion Picture Association for action and mild violence. Running time: 92 minutes. Two and a half stars out of four.\n___\nFollow AP Film Writer Jake Coyle on Twitter at: http://twitter.com/jakecoyleAP",

        "text": "The Super Mario Bros. Movie is designed to be a crowd-pleaser. Illumination Entertainment, the animation studio behind the Minions, unites the world-famous Mario Bros. franchise with Michael Jelenic and Aaron Horvath, creators of the wildly popular and kinetic cartoon series Teen Titans Go! For good measure, they stuff the cast with comedic talent, including Jack Black, Keegan-Michael Key, Charlie Day, Seth Rogen, Fred Armisen, and MCU movie star Chris Pratt. And yet, The Super Mario Bros. Movie falls short of being solidly fun.\nThe Super Mario Bros. Movie is loaded with fan service.\nWith over 20 games and counting to its credit, the Super Mario Bros. franchise offers plenty of iconography from which filmmakers can pull to thrill fans. Directors Horvath and Jelenic use plenty. Composer Brian Tyler shrewdly works in Koji Kondo's original Nintendo tunes throughout the movie. Goosed with an orchestral approach, these once chirping themes have a cinematic grandeur that plays well whether the bros are submerging into a treacherous sewer, celebrating a victory at a castle, or facing off against the dreaded Bowser.\nBeyond a central cast that boasts Mario (Chris Pratt), Luigi (Charlie Day), Princess Peach (Anya Taylor-Joy), Bowser (Jack Black), and Donkey Kong (Seth Rogen), The Super Mario Bros. Movie also includes appearances from Toads, Koopa Troopas, Goombas, Dry Bones, King Boo, Bullet Bill, Cheep Cheep, Shy Guys, and more. There are also familiar backdrops and action sequences based on gameplay, including a fast and furious car chase on Rainbow Road. However, not every detail is given care in its inclusion.\nFor every satisfyingly spooky bit with a re-animating Dry Bones, there's a scad of critters that are passed over in a traveling montage that feels like a joyless checklist. Most painful, the action scenes \u2014 while popping with references to the games \u2014 never score the jolting rush of actually playing them. In a kids' movie so brightly colored it's an actual eyesore, there's no chance the heroic brothers will truly fall. So the stakes aren't life or death or win or lose. It's all blandly inevitable.\nThe Super Mario Bros. Movie plays it safe with cliches.\nThere's a woeful lack of originality in the storytelling. The screenplay, credited to Mark Fogel, leans heavily on tedious tropes plucked from superhero movies and fantasy adventures. Mario is re-imagined in the vein of an MCU hero. He's a scrappy underdog, desperate to prove himself, when a twist of fate gives him the chance and superpowers \u2014 in this case, in the form of mushroom power-ups.\nNaturally, there's a comical training montage featuring the hero learning how to hone his new skills. He'll be faced with an antagonist who is his opposite: large, vicious, and hard-shelled, where he is thin-skinned (and sensitive to being called \"small\"). The Super Mario Bros. Movie even taps into the MCU trope of having a climactic battle in New York City, where a hero will be heralded even after bringing mayhem to his home turf.\nFor good measure, Fogel folds in a tedious backstory in Brooklyn, where Mario's extended Italian-American family clamors at him in stereotypical outbursts over pasta to tell him he's a loser. Did you ever wish Mario had daddy issues? If so, well, good for you; The Super Mario Bros. Movie will give you that.\nBeyond this, the love triangle between Mario, Peach, and Bowser plays on the age-old archetype of a white knight rescuing a beautiful princess from a violent tyrant. Admittedly, in the movie's version, Peach is more of a Stong Female Character(opens in a new tab), who despite being more skilled at the training track than Mario, will gladly step aside to let him do much of the derring-do. Where Adventure Time took this trope and steadily complicated it, The Super Mario Bros. Movie gives Peach an action scene or two and calls it a day. Who needs a three-dimensional heroine when female empowerment can be cheat coded?\nHow does The Super Mario Bros. Movie compare to 1993's Super Mario Bros.?\nUndoubtedly, The Super Mario Bros. Movie is more true to Nintendo's IP than the 1993 live-action movie, which featured a fungus-covered metropolis, Goombas as towering thugs, and Bowser as a spiky-haired mobster. Directed by Rocky Morton and Annabel Jankel, Super Mario Bros. was a ludicrously stupid movie that had astoundingly little to do with the game that inspired it. But you know what it got right? Mario.\nRightly heralded character actor Bob Hoskins brought a grit-teethed, blue-collar determination to the plucky plumber. And, as he also did in Who Framed Roger Rabbit?, he offered a poignant arc of a cynical man who learns to open up amid a world of cartoonish mayhem. Did he sound like Mario from the games? Absolutely not. But you understood who Mario was from the first grumble of Hoskins' take on a Brooklyn accent. Chris Pratt cannot compare.\nSure, Pratt has done terrific voicework as a naive but lovable oaf in The Lego Movie and Onward. But in The Super Mario Bros. Movie, he's lost that spark. His Mario doesn't do the \"Its-a me\" voice, save for a cheeky commercial for his fledgling plumbing company. And that's fine. Frankly, that bit would have grown stale quickly. But whatever voice Pratt is doing isn't Brooklyn, and it isn't anything particularly specific, consistent, or exciting.\nAround him, Charlie Day and Keegan-Michael Key bring exuberance as sidekicks Luigi and Toad. Fred Armisen brings trademark comedic snark as Cranky Kong. Seth Rogen lets loose with earnest glee as Donkey Kong. Khary Payton even gets some laughs as a snarling Penguin King. Anya Taylor-Joy is also in this movie. But Pratt is meant to be the heart at its center, and his performance feels painfully middle of the (rainbow) road. Mario as a character doesn't jump out beyond the tedious cliches of his story. He's the hero because the movie says so, not because he makes our hearts soar with excitement. So, who could blame you if you're rooting for someone else instead?\nJack Black is glorious as Bowser.\nSpecifically, national treasure Jack Black is charisma and chaotic starlight in human form. Whether onscreen in comedy gems like School of Rock, High Fidelity, The Polka King, or Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle, or lending his voice to Po in the Kung Fu Panda movies, Black is a force of nature that can elevate any project. As Bowser, he gives a growling performance that is instantly enthralling as the bass of his Tenacious D voice rattles through the theater speakers in an action-packed opening for fire, ice, and silliness. But where his performance really comes alive is when Bowser sings.\nWhile Bowser is thinly sketched baddie schtick, Black makes him unquestionably fun when he pours that black heart into a power ballad about loving Princess Peach. All my gripes about this movie were silenced during the interludes when Black lets loose in all his rock star might to sing, \"Peaches, Peaches, Peaches, Peaches, Peaches,\" over and over.\nIt's fine for a Mario movie to be stupid. It's right, even. But it should still be fun. In the Jack Black sections, this balance of stupid and fun are perfect. But too much of this movie feels like a nakedly commercial grasp for nostalgia-inducing cash.\nThere's fan service, and then there's pandering.\nOf course, The Super Mario Bros. Movie is bursting with stuff from the games. There are even a few amusing jokes about game culture, like when one Toad urges another to fix a broken item by \"blowing into it.\" Beyond these bits, Horvath and Jelenic bolster the soundtrack with popular songs like \"Holding Out for a Hero,\" \"Take on Me,\" and \"Mr. Blue Sky.\" These upbeat jams scratch at the surface of their scenes' meanings, offering easy head-nodding and energy but little depth. There's no sense of challenge or play in this movie.\nUnlike The Lego Movie or even the Barbie teaser, this toy-based film is missing that spark that reminds us of the unique joy of playing with its inspiration. There's nothing here that connects to our childhoods like the click of Legos or the madcap multiverse mayhem of a fleet of Barbies converging on a painted beachscape. Perhaps because The Super Mario Bros. Movie is so determined not to rile fans or the brand, there's an aching lack of self-aware humor. Pratfalls are plentiful, but there are too few punchlines.\nIn the end, it feels like one long commercial. Sure, I walked away wanting to revisit my old Mario games. But I also walked away with no wish to ever again hit play on The Super Mario Bros. Movie.\nThe Super Mario Bros. Movie opens in theaters April 7.",

        "text": "REVIEW: The Super Mario Bros. Movie redefines retro\nA fun (albeit safe), romp through the Mushroom Kingdom\nThe story of Super Mario as we know it began in the mid 80\u2019s with the release of Super Mario Bros. for the NES \u2013 a humble arcade platformer developed by Nintendo that featured the titular character, Mario, running and jumping his way through a variety of levels all in pursuit of saving Princess Toadstool, aka Peach.\nUnbeknownst to Nintendo at the time, Mario would soon become the face and brand of the company as a whole, soaring in popularity through the 90\u2019s to eventually becoming the household name that he is today. For nearly 4 decades, we\u2019ve seen countless Mario games, tons of tie-in merchandise, and even more recently a whole theme park! However, in all that time, there has only been one concerted effort by Nintendo to create a feature film based on the little red plumber\u2026 and it failed miserably! Sure, it\u2019s achieved a \u2018cult classic\u2019 status among some fans, but that is far removed from the expectations Nintendo likely had for it.\nThe original Super Mario Bros. film released in 1993, after which fans received nothing but radio silence as far as Nintendo-based film adaptations were concerned. That is, until 2018, when it was revealed to the world that not only would Nintendo be making a grand return to the big screen, but they wouldn\u2019t be doing it alone. They would also be working with Illumination to produce an animated Mario movie. Naturally, many fans had their concerns.\nI\u2019ve been a fan of Super Mario my whole life, with 1996\u2019s Super Mario 64 being the first video game I ever owned, as well as THE game to introduce me to the medium as a whole. Now, all these years later, I consider the Super Mario brand to be a major part of who I am today. So, when the news of a new film came through, I was cautiously optimistic \u2013 especially when considering how Nintendo\u2019s first outing went.\nThankfully, now that the film is out in full, I can confidently state that 2023\u2019s The Super Mario Bros. Movie is a fantastic adaptation of one of gaming\u2019s most iconic characters. That\u2019s not to say the film is without its flaws, but for fans like myself who have effectively been waiting for this moment all their lives\u2026 it\u2019s good to report that it lives up to the hype.\nThe setup for this movie is pretty straightforward: Mario & Luigi get sucked into a warp pipe while on a normal plumbing job, thus becoming entangled in a conflict between Bowser\u2019s army and the Mushroom Kingdom, with Bowser aiming to use the Power Star to kidnap and marry Princess Peach. For fans of the games, it\u2019s pretty familiar and feels a bit \u201csafe\u201d as far as Mario narratives go. However, the real problem with this movie\u2019s story is that it moves along a bit too fast. There were multiple plot points and settings in the film that I felt just came and went without a chance to breathe, thus not allowing the audience nor the characters to really sink their teeth into any given scene. It\u2019s something I kind of expected going in, with the runtime being a meager 92 minutes. Thankfully, the pacing issues don\u2019t take anything away from the film, I just left the theater wanting more BECAUSE what\u2019s already there is so good.\nHo-humness of the story aside, the real spectacle of this movie comes from the characters and the worlds they find themselves in. There are so many small details in the expansive environments and range of character performances that makes every scene feel like special attention was given to every scene. You can really tell that the folks working on this project were huge fans of Mario because nearly every frame feels distinctly, well, Mario. It\u2019s difficult to put into words without getting into spoiler territory, though some examples that come to mind stem from the trailers leading up to the movie\u2019s release.\nThe first being this scene featuring Mario & Luigi running through the streets of Brooklyn, and all of a sudden this lineup of construction platforms becomes the exact layout of Level 1-1 from the original Super Mario Bros!\nI also wanted to give special shoutouts to Donkey Kong\u2019s trailer for showing this amazing crowd of kongs cheering him on, and riiight in one of the corners here allowing us to see some of his past co-stars from the games, including Chunky Kong, Dixie Kong, and Diddy Kong!\nSpeaking of characters, one of the biggest points of discourse leading up to this film\u2019s release was the voice cast \u2013 and naturally so, since Chris Pratt as Mario was certainly not going to be anyone\u2019s first pick, much less Jack Black as Bowser. At the time when the cast list was revealed, I was personally willing to give everyone their fair shot and had faith that Nintendo knew what they were doing with this project and after seeing it\u2026 I\u2019m glad I did. Nearly every single member of the cast delivers a performance that perfectly plays to their strengths while also working in service of the character.\nI loved Anya Taylor-Joy\u2019s portrayal of Princess Peach. She feels more independent here than in your typical Mario game, free from her usual role of captive and depicted as more of a level-headed mentor figure to her loyal Toads \u2013 and even Mario himself to some extent! Speaking of the red plumber, I went into this film expecting not to like Chris Pratt\u2019s performance as Mario, and I\u2019m kind of glad I did as I feel that if I had walked in with any expectations higher than that I would\u2019ve been disappointed.\nChris\u2019 Mario is okay, but his performance doesn\u2019t feel particularly unique or special. It\u2019s not bad by any means, and after about 5 minutes I kinda forgot who was voicing him. Honestly, at the end of the day, I\u2019m just glad it wasn\u2019t as offensive as I thought it would be. Charlie Day\u2019s Luigi, on the other hand, is great! I feel that Charlie\u2019s performance, unlike Chris\u2019 Mario, brings a certain energy to the role that just feels right for Luigi. He\u2019s the lovable scaredy cat we\u2019ve all come to adore over the years, and I feel like that plays well to a lot of Charlie\u2019s strengths as an actor too. It just feels right.\nOf course, there is an entire cast list I could go on and on about, and if I were to give my thoughts on every single performance this review would be too long to read, so I\u2019ll tie up this section with a character that deserves extra special recognition: Jack Black as Bowser.\nIf there were ever to be a perfect marriage between actor and character for a video game adaptation like this, it would be Jack Black playing Bowser. Unlike Mario, I had really high hopes for Jack\u2019s performance as Bowser \u2013 and much to my own surprise, Jack Black delivered beyond my expectations. It\u2019s really one of those things you\u2019ve got to see to believe, as I\u2019m sure my words don\u2019t do it justice, but Jack Black really does bring a whole new element to this character, oftentimes stealing every scene that he\u2019s in \u2013 ESPECIALLY with that musical number! There\u2019s a certain level of authenticity that bleeds through to the character because you can tell that Jack Black LOVES being Bowser, and I believe that is something that audiences will definitely pick up on.\nTo keep the music track going, this film\u2019s score rocks. So many iconic melodies and themes from Mario\u2019s past resurface throughout the film and it is all a joy to listen to via the new, soaring orchestral performances they\u2019ve been given here. But it\u2019s really no surprise, as the film\u2019s composer, Brian Tyler, worked in collaboration with Nintendo\u2019s longtime Mario composer, Koji Kondo, to bring this film\u2019s score to life. Each original track is truly fantastic, and once more you can feel the love for the source material, but these tracks are occasionally overshadowed by some very non-Nintendo musical cues. You see, being that this is an Illumination film, some fans were concerned that we would see some of the animation studios\u2019 influence in this movie \u2013 specifically their penchant for using licensed tracks (see Despicable Me\u2019s use of \u201cYou Should Be Dancing\u201d). And, for better or worse, that\u2019s precisely what ended up happening.\nMuch like the music itself, a lot of this is going to come down to opinion on whether or not you think they work for the scene. I\u2019m personally of the mind that some do and some don\u2019t, though I would have much rather removed ALL of them in favor of using actual Mario music instead, as it would feel more authentic to the world and allow for just that little extra bit of world building.\nThe Super Mario Bros. Movie, in many ways, feels like a studio testing the waters. There are some things that work better than others, but for a first foray back into the movie sphere \u2013 and for fans of Mario both new and old \u2013 this film is fantastic! As I mentioned earlier, you can really tell that everyone who worked on this film loves Super Mario. From the visual designs, the music, and especially all of the numerous retro callbacks, it all adds up to a film experience that I cannot recommend enough.\nAdd Comment\nComments (1)\nultimateownage8h ago\nI just got home from seeing this at the theater, and your review is spot on. I really want to see it again, but will wait for a disk release so I can rewind and look closely at so many of the scenes. It\u2019s that good of a fan service movie with hidden throwbacks sprinkled everywhere.\nIt was also so colorful and fun. It almost felt more like a theme park ride than a movie at times, and considering the source material it fit very well. Such an awesome thing to see, and I\u2019m so stoked to see Mr. Miyamoto get to witness his vision for the series come to life like this and be such a resounding success.\nThis is surely just the beginning for Nintendo and film. And I\u2019m here for it.",

        "text": "Folks have been having all sorts of emotional turmoil about this new Super Mario Bros. Movie since the moment it was announced that Guardians of the Galaxy and Lego Movie star Chris Pratt would provide the voice of Mario. All that gnashing of teeth was for nothing, though. The Super Mario Bros.. Movie is both pretty funny and also just plain pretty--this movie is a feast for the eyes.\nThis adventure begins in Brooklyn, with a pair of brothers whose family plumbing business is--despite a stellar local TV ad featuring the Super Mario Bros.. Super Show theme--struggling. A brother-and-brother plumbing outfit? In this economy? Forget about it.\nFortunately, these normal-life problems are pretty quickly forgotten when Mario and Luigi venture deep into the sewers to try to figure out why Brooklyn's streets are spontaneously filling with water. They discover a weirdly intricate structure that goes deep underground, but before they can explore it fully, Mario steps into the wrong pipe and is transported to the Mushroom Kingdom.\nLuigi, unfortunately, ends up in Bowser's Dark Land and then, in short order, Bowser's dungeon. So Luigi is the damsel in distress, and it's up to Mario and Peach to save him and all the other people/things that Bowser might like to do bad things with. And since Bowser was already in the process of conquering the universe at the start of this movie, there are plenty of people/things that he plans to do bad things with.\nPeach (Anya Taylor-Joy), the ruler of the Mushroom Kingdom, needs to unite everyone else around who might be threatened by Bowser's never-ending war of conquest. Who else is there to even unite, you may ask? Well, there's a whole country full of Kongs who would be handy in a fight.\nIf it sounds like Mario is taking a backseat in his own movie, don't worry. While it may seem like Peach is the real main character of the Super Mario Bros. Movie, that's like calling Thorin Oakenshield the main character of The Hobbit. Yes, I'm saying that Mario in this movie is pretty much Bilbo Baggins--a short guy who everybody underestimates because he never seems to be that important or have many practical skills, but who has a penchant for being in the right place at the right time and pulling off clever surprises. He's the wild card.\nAs for Chris Pratt's performance as Mario: He's fine. He's just as good at being the likable white guy here as he usually is, and he's usually funny when he's supposed to be.\nThat's pretty much how it goes across the board for the voice talent. Nobody is bad, and they're all funny when they need to be in basically the ways you would expect. Seth Rogen plays Donkey Kong like he's a Seth Rogen character in a stoner movie. Bowser, likewise, pretty much just is Jack Black, complete with a musical number that sounds like a Tenacious D ballad. Nothing to complain about there, certainly--like most of the jokes in The Super Mario Bros. Movie, the song is funny! But it's not too funny. It's normal funny.\nBut this isn't a movie that needs to rely on the charms of its voice talent for success. Honestly, it works even better as an adventure flick than it does as a comedy, because it's got several incredibly well-crafted action sequences that absolutely blew me away.\nThe Mario Kart Rainbow Road sequence that you've seen glimpses of in the trailers and other ads is one that folks will talk about a lot, but it's just one of a few stellar sequences that make The Super Mario Bros. Movie rate alongside Into the Spider-Verse as a visual experience. It's not as good as Into the Spider-Verse overall, but there's a similar quality to the craftsmanship.\nAnd a big part of that is the philosophy behind the adaptation. The Super Mario Bros. Movie is chock-full of Easter eggs and other references to the decades of Mario-related content. But since our enjoyment of Mario as an IP isn't really plot-related, the filmmakers were able to incorporate everything into the aesthetic of the world.\nTake, for example, a scene in the middle of the movie where Mario and Peach have a heartfelt chat under a tree, at night, in a rolling field full of Fire Flowers. It's a shot that looks incredible in its own right--the Flowers are just a bonus for those who care. Likewise, we've got several platforming sequences that are direct nods to the gameplay of the Mario series, but they're so well done and cool to watch that they don't feel obligatory, even though they definitely were obligatory.\nThe Super Mario Bros. Movie never feels reverent of the Mario IP, but it's also never disrespectful. It's a spot that might not have worked if the film weren't so well put together--fortunately for us, though, The Super Mario Bros., could end up being one of the best big-budget action flicks of the year.",

        "text": "The most delightful part of Nintendo\u2019s entire Mario franchise is how \u2014 despite all their decades of conflicts in various video games \u2014 Mario, Bowser, Peach, and the rest of their crew have really always been a troupe of actors putting on whimsical stage plays for a captive audience. That idea alone isn\u2019t exactly what defines Universal and Illumination\u2019s new The Super Mario Bros. Movie from co-directors Aaron Horvath and Michael Jelenic. But much in the same way Super Mario Bros. 3\u2019s ending invited players to think about and appreciate it as being more than just a video game, The Super Mario Bros. Movie plays like a magical celebration of how this franchise has evolved.\nFor years after Nintendo\u2019s first live-action Super Mario Bros. movie debuted in theaters and immediately bombed at the box office, it seemed as if the studio wanted nothing more than to leave the entire endeavor in the past and steer clear of trying to make movies. But one of the more intriguing things about Universal\u2019s new feature \u2014 a co-production between Nintendo and Illumination \u2014 is how effectively it manages to weave together so many iconic elements from the franchise\u2019s bigger outings, like the \u201990s movie, Mario Kart, and the Donkey Kong games, into a story that\u2019s equal parts nostalgic and reflective of the franchise\u2019s future.\nIn addition to being generally good guys who know a thing or two about pipes, The Super Mario Bros. Movie\u2019s Mario (Chris Pratt) and Luigi (Charlie Day) are also introduced as Brooklynites and small business owners trying to make a name for themselves in the film\u2019s opening scenes. As adults and the two youngest members of their surprisingly large family, both of the Mario bros. know how crushing it can be to come home every day to nothing but incessant criticism. But at the heart of Mario and Luigi\u2019s bond is also the mutual understanding that, so long as the two of them stick together, there\u2019s little they can\u2019t accomplish.\nThat attitude\u2019s what gets the brothers up every morning and inspires them to go out into the world in search of bill-paying gigs. But it\u2019s also why they\u2019re both so game when they unexpectedly get sucked into the adventure of a lifetime by way of a mysterious green pipe hidden somewhere deep in New York City\u2019s sewer system.\nBecause it\u2019s so dense with painstakingly crafted details meant to spark joy from the jump, it\u2019s hard to pinpoint exactly when The Super Mario Bros. Movie\u2019s intangible magic \u2014 the general feeling, rather than the movie\u2019s actual magic \u2014 first kicks in. But as the Mario bros. jump, flip, and twirl their way across town on foot in an early action sequence styled after the classic Mario side scrollers, you can immediately get a sense of just how serious the movie is about translating the essence of its source material into something that feels familiar but also like its own distinct quantity.\nThis ends up being the case with most of The Super Mario Bros. Movie\u2019s complex set pieces, which doesn\u2019t come as a surprise given Illumination\u2019s track record and Nintendo\u2019s reputation for being extremely protective of its brands. What does come as something of a shock, though, is how genuinely inoffensive (which is to say \u201cnot off-putting\u201d) Pratt and Day\u2019s takes on Mario and Luigi are \u2014 a concern the movie addresses head-on with some solid gags and a textual explanation as to why Mario occasionally sounds like he might have spent some time in Pawnee, Indiana.\nAs much information about the Mario bros. as the film lays out before they\u2019re isekai-ed across the galaxy, it\u2019s far, far more reserved about others like Bowser (Jack Black) and his sorcerer Kamek (Kevin Michael Richardson), who serve as hammy villain foils to the Mushroom Kingdom\u2019s Princess Peach (Anya Taylor-Joy) and her loyal subject Toad (Keegan-Michael Key.)\nIf you\u2019ve played through games like Super Mario World or Super Mario Odyssey, then the general shape of The Super Mario Bros. Movie\u2019s plot will be obvious from the moment you first hear why Bowser\u2019s so hell-bent on getting his hands on a certain star-shaped MacGuffin. The movie works, though, because as it\u2019s building toward its logical and very traditional Mario kind of ending, it uses every possible opportunity it has to make its various fantastical worlds feel like living, breathing, organic places that you\u2019d want to spend hours exploring if they were parts of an open-world video game. It\u2019s cool as hell every single time someone\u2019s outfit transforms after they ingest mushroom power-ups, but it\u2019s things like being able to see each of the individual seeds on a fire flower\u2019s face flicking like a candle that really make you appreciate how hard the movie\u2019s working to get things \u201cright.\u201d\nAt times, it almost feels like Illumination might have gone overboard in terms of dotting its i\u2019s and crossing its t\u2019s for a movie that moves incredibly fast and consistently has the air of something that\u2019s been crafted with children prone to rewatching the same thing in mind. But it\u2019s just as easy to interpret those things about the film as signs of how much more immersive and engaging Nintendo plans for its Mario theme park and future games to be.\nWatching The Super Mario Bros. Movie, it\u2019s impossible not to imagine what it might be like to one day play a game as visually rich running on hardware that puts current-gen Nintendo Switch to shame. That\u2019s probably (part of) the reason the movie exists. But as big-budget commercials for video games and consoles go, The Super Mario Bros. Movie\u2019s going to be undefeated for quite some time.\nThe Super Mario Bros. Movie also stars Seth Rogen, Fred Armisen, Sebastian Maniscalco, and Charles Martinet. The movie\u2019s slated to hit theaters on April 5th.",

Film Critic, age 15\nThe story of The Super Mario Bros. on their journey through the Mushroom Kingdom. A Brooklyn plumber named Mario travels through the Mushroom Kingdom with a princess named Peach and an anthropomorphic mushroom named Toad to find Mario\u2019s brother, Luigi, and to save the world from a ruthless fire-breathing Koopa named Bowser.\nKIDS FIRST! Film Critic Katherine S. comments, \u201cThe Super Mario Bros. Movie is the perfect video-game to movie adaptation! There\u2019s lots of laughs for all ages and loads of references to the Mario Games for all fans. I enjoy this animated movie because it gives the iconic characters we all know and love the movie adaptation that they all deserve.\u201d See her full review below.\nThe Super Mario Bros. Movie\nKatherine S.,\nKIDS FIRST! Film Critic, age 15\nThe Super Mario Bros. Movie is the perfect video-game to movie adaptation! There\u2019s lots of laughs for all ages and loads of references to the Mario Games for all fans. I enjoy this animated movie because it gives the iconic characters we all know and love the movie adaptation that they all deserve.\nIn this movie, we learn the origin story of our favorite video-game brothers, Mario and Luigi. Mario (Chris Pratt) and Luigi (Charlie Day) are just your average brothers living and working in Brooklyn as plumbers, but when they find a warp pipe in the sewer, they get transported to the magical land where Toads, Yoshi\u2019s and Koopa Troopas roam. Along the way, Luigi gets captured by the evil Bowser (Jack Black) and with the help of Princess Peach (Anya Taylor-Joy), Mario is forced to \u2018level up\u2019 and fight Bowser before he conquers the world.\nThere\u2019s no need to play the video games to like this movie, but existing fans of the franchise will especially love it because of all the Easter eggs and familiar songs. This is such an imaginative story with characters and themes from some of my favorite games in the franchise \u2013 Mario Kart, Super Mario Bros. and Donkey Kong. I love how this has elements of the classic games but also new twists, like how Princess Peach in this movie isn\u2019t like your normal Princess Peach in need of rescuing, because she can save herself and is very skillful at doing so. I also love how relatable the brothers are as they are from our world. We\u2019ve been seeing a lot of high quality animation from Illumination recently, and this movie follows the trend. The animation is cheerful and lively and the quality is top-notch. Jack Black, as Bowser, is absolutely perfect in this role. His versatile voice makes for an almost manic Bowser \u2013 scary, evil, quirky and laughable \u2013 and he can flip the two like a light switch. Chris Pratt as Mario and Charlie Day as Luigi have a lot of chemistry and seem like very close brothers. Collectively, they are relatable and help us sympathize with the plot even more.\nThe messages of The Super Mario Bros. Movie are that family is the most powerful thing in the world (real and virtual) and when working together, you can accomplish anything.\nI give The Super Mario Bros. Movie 4 of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 8 to 18, plus adults. Players of any Mario games will enjoy this. It comes out in theaters April 5, 2023.",

        "text": "Back on the big screen after a three-decade absence, Brooklyn\u2019s finest plumbers tool up for a Universal franchise\nDirs: Aaron Horvath, Michael Jelenic. US. 2023. 92mins\nMario and Luigi\u2019s first big-screen outing in 30 years is a colourful animated adventure that unfortunately seems less interested in establishing its own identity than in setting up a sure-to-be-lucrative franchise. At its best, The Super Mario Bros. Movie has the same carefree spirit as the beloved Nintendo game series, sending its iconic characters flying through the air or careening in high-octane go-karts. But whether it\u2019s the hit-or-miss jokes or the familiar action beats, the film too often plays down to its young audience, valuing rambunctious energy over wit or heart.\nLess interested in establishing its own identity than in setting up a sure-to-be-lucrative franchise\nCritics\u2019 nitpicking should hardly affect Universal\u2019s bottom line, however: as the better-than-expected returns for Dungeons & Dragons: Honour Among Thieves suggest, family audiences are hungry for viable film options, and this Illumination production should fit the bill. Add in a star-studded voice cast that includes Chris Pratt, Anya Taylor-Joy, Jack Black and Seth Rogen, and The Super Mario Bros. Movie\u2019s commercial prospects look even brighter. Sequels seem sure to follow.\nLiving in Brooklyn, where they\u2019re trying to get their nascent plumbing business off the ground, loyal brothers Mario (voiced by Pratt) and Luigi (Charlie Day) are desperate to find customers. When a massive underground leak threatens to flood the city, they spring into action, only to be sucked down a pipe into a fantasy realm known as The Mushroom Kingdom, ruled by the kindly Princess Peach (Taylor-Joy) who is trying to keep her toad subjects safe from the evil turtle Bowser (Black).\nThe 1993 Super Mario Bros., which starred Bob Hoskins and John Leguizamo, was a notorious debacle both commercially and critically, well-remembered as one of the first (and worst) live-action treatments of a popular video game. The Mario game franchise has only grown since, spawning spinoffs such as Mario Kart that have greatly expanded the scope of the property. The Super Mario Bros. Movie seeks to appeal to that global fan base: unlike the dark-toned earlier film, the new picture is cheerful and breezy, primarily concerned with laying out the games\u2019 central characters and principal settings.\nThere are plenty of knowing references for those familiar with Mario and Luigi, as well as self-mocking jabs at some of the franchise\u2019s sillier conventions. (Why do the brothers wear white gloves if they\u2019re supposed to be plumbers?) In keeping with the film\u2019s hyperactive bent, directors Aaron Horvath and Michael Jelenic \u2014 who co-wrote Teen Titans Go! To The Movies (which Horvath also co-directed) \u2014 stuff the short running time with action and jokes, often to the detriment of character development. It doesn\u2019t help matters that after the brothers land in this fantastical world, Luigi is captured by Bowser and separated from Mario, depriving the picture not just of Day and Pratt\u2019s lively interactions but also the characters\u2019 close bond. Instead, Mario teams up with Princess Peach to rescue Luigi, and the chemistry between these two characters is not especially electric. Black and Rogen (who voices Donkey Kong) bring their trademark boisterous energy, doing their best to fill in the gaps of underwritten roles with their own oversized personalities.\nAlthough its humour is often aimed at children \u2014 the film is littered with ultra-adorable side characters and slapstick-y antics \u2014 Matthew Fogel\u2019s screenplay doesn\u2019t offer much in the way of life lessons or emotional shading for younger viewers. The picture\u2019s only consistently sophisticated element is its rich animation, especially once our heroes arrive in The Mushroom Kingdom, which recreates the look and feel of jumping, punching, flying and driving like Mario and Luigi. Particularly pleasing is an extended Mario Kart-like chase sequence on a winding rainbow road high above the ground, the action slightly recalling the pedal-to-the-metal euphoria of Mad Max: Fury Road.\nBut as often happens with the first instalments of anticipated cinematic franchises, The Super Mario Bros. Movie too often follows a predictable blockbuster template, turning Mario, Luigi and Princess Peach into just the latest superheroes who must save the world from a seemingly all-powerful foe. To be sure, Horvath and Jelenic try to slyly undercut such grandiosity, emphasising how ordinary Mario is. (The film also has pointed fun satirising the cartoonishly Italian voice Mario has brandished in the video games, although Pratt\u2019s affected Brooklyn accent isn\u2019t appreciably better.) The potential appeal of a new Mario picture is the opportunity it presents for filmmakers to bring the property\u2019s memorable set pieces to a larger canvas. Sadly, The Super Mario Bros. Movie isn\u2019t game enough to go its own way.\nProduction company: Shigeru Miyamoto/Chris Meledandri Productions\nWorldwide distribution: Universal Pictures\nProducers: Chris Meledandri, Shigeru Miyamoto\nScreenplay: Matthew Fogel\nProduction design: Guillaume Aretos\nEditing: Eric Osmond\nMusic: Brian Tyler\nMain voice cast: Chris Pratt, Anya Taylor-Joy, Charlie Day, Jack Black, Keegan-Michael Key, Seth Rogen, Fred Armisen",

        "text": "Super Mario Bros Movie review round-up: this is what the critics think\nThe latest video game adaptation is here and it's got people talking.\nThe new Super Mario Bros movie hits the big screen this week. This adaptation of the hit video game franchise is a very big deal for Nintendo. The games giant will have looked at the success of the two Sonic movies and will be hoping that its Italian plumber can bring in a similar audience.\nCast wise, it's packed with A-Listers. While it was a touch controversial to have Christ Pratt to voice Mario, he is a big, well-known star. And the rest of the voice cast more than match him, with Anya Taylor-Joy (Princess Peach), Charlie Day (Luigi) and Jack Black (Bowser) also starring.\nThe Super Mario Bros movie has screened to a number of critics and the full reviews are out!\nThe good news is: there is a lot of love for the movie, with critics praising how well it measures against the games and how it captures the feel of playing Mario. However, there are also some who aren't convinced by the film... at all.\nShortList has seen it - with a six-year-old next to us, no less. The movie does exactly what it needs to for a video game adaptation: it hurls many a throwback to the games - with no end of music cues and background Easter eggs - at the audience, while also forging its own rather enjoyable, if bumpy, story.\nHere are what others are saying about the Super Mario Bros Movie...\nEmpire gave it two stars, noting (rather harshly, we feel): \"Beautifully animated, and about as faithful and affectionate as a corporate cash-in is possible to get \u2014 but it still doesn\u2019t come close to the experience of actually playing the games.\"\nGamesRadar is a little more affectionate in its three-star review, saying: \"Every frame is stacked with cameos and references to wider Mario lore too, including a particularly elegant classic gameplay sequence that\u2019ll give you a nostalgia rush.\"\nT3 is a fan, with its piece on the movie, noting: \"Illumination Entertainment's animated take on Nintendo's famous plumbers is a perfect exercise in fan service.\"\nThe Guardian is grumpy, really grumpy. Its reviewer must have had a terrible day when they watched the film - and must have been in a screening sans cheering children - as its po-faced review howls: \"This much-trailed, much-hyped new animated feature is tedious and flat in all senses, a disappointment to match the live-action version in 1993.\" Oof.\nAV Club is far happier about the film, explaining in its B-Rating: \"Perhaps the film\u2019s greatest asset is its clever reliance on the treasure trove of IP that Nintendo has to offer. Directors Aaron Horvath and Michael Jelenic (the duo behind Teen Titans Go!) string together Easter eggs and witty references in a quantity that rivals Steven Spielberg\u2019s 2018 adventure Ready Player One.\"\nVariety is also filled with Mario joy, with its review saying: \"The movie, as directed by Aaron Horvath and Michael Jelenic (from a script by Matthew Fogel), is a serious blast, with a spark of enchantment \u2014 that je ne sais quoi fusion of speed and trickery, magic and sophistication, and sheer play that\u2026well, you feel it when you see it.\"\nIndieWire is also (nearly) a fan, saying about the Mario movie: \"Parents shouldn\u2019t expect a Pixar-level experience, but Matthew Fogel\u2019s script has as at least much narrative heft as the best Mario games. Kids\u2019 movies can be \u2014 and often are \u2014 so much worse. Nobody is reinventing the blue shell, but Horvath and Jelenic do an excellent job of recreating the Mushroom Kingdom from the recent video games while adding a decidedly cinematic flair.\"\nAnother good review is from The Wrap which notes: \"Ultimately, the animated adventure is an exciting thrill ride through some of the most beloved realms in the gaming world. It\u2019s hard not to fall in love with a film so earnest and proud of its origins.\"\nThe Telegraph, which isn't afraid to give 1 stars to films that are almost certainly going to be a hit with audiences, has given another 1 star to a film that's almost certainly going to be a hit with audiences, skewering the movie with blistering passages of prose like the following: \"The journey isn\u2019t an adventure so much as a CG walking tour of brand assets \u2013 items, environments, sound effects, music cues, and so on \u2013 drawn from 38 years of Mario games.\"\nThe BBC also isn't a fan, saying/sighing: \"The Super Mario Bros Movie will probably make a fortune, because it is harmless and colourful enough to be almost adequate as an Easter holiday time-passer for small children.\"\nThe BBC is, of course, right. The Super Mario Bros movie is very much critic proof, with a projected $220 million set to be made from the movie.\nOur advice: watch it with an excited - and always-smiling - six-year-old and the film will be an absolute blast. Just make sure no Guardian or Telegraph critics are in the same room.\n- These are the best video game adaptations of all time - the ones that don't suck!",

        "text": "\u201cThe Super Mario Bros. Movie\u201d gives you a wholesome prankish druggy chameleonic video-game buzz; it\u2019s also a nice, sweet confection for 6-year-olds. Historically, the proverbial problem with live-action movies based on video games \u2014 and \u201cSuper Mario Bros.,\u201d a leaden dud released 30 years ago, had the dishonor of being the very first one \u2014 is that they jam-pack the screen with tropes and fights and characters and landscapes right out of the game, but when it comes to molding all that gimcrackery into, you know, a story, they lose the electronic pulse that made the game addictive. Digital animation is, and always should have been, the true cousin of video games (which are essentially computer fantasies that you control). And \u201cThe Super Mario Bros. Movie\u201d takes full advantage of the sculptural liquid zap of the computer-animation medium. Yet it also has a fairy-tale story that\u2019s good enough to get you onto its wavelength.\nWhen Mario, the mustached, overalls-wearing Italian plumber of Nintendo fame (voiced by Chris Pratt as an eager Brooklyn everyman), swirls down a New York sewer and into the Mushroom Kingdom, where he learns to leap from one now-you-see-it floating airborne block to the next, or faces off against the preening, super-strong but not really all that mighty Donkey Kong (Seth Rogen) on a network of red girders in a gladiatorial arena that\u2019s hanging 2,000 feet in the air, or zips along a superhighway of pure rainbow light in a go-kart race that\u2019s aggressive enough to look like something out of \u201cMad Max: Candy-Land Road,\u201d the movie doesn\u2019t so much duplicate the logistics of a Mario game as conjure the spirit of the game. We\u2019ve enmeshed in every choice, every movement. The action isn\u2019t vacuous or ponderous \u2014 it makes speed and light seem concretely alive.\nMario and his timid brother, Luigi (Charlie Day), are devoted to each other, and they\u2019re out to start their own plumbing business (complete with a TV commercial in which they speak in fake kitsch Italian accents). But then they delve into the sewer to fix a water-main break and get sucked down into an alternate universe. Mario lands in the Mushroom Kingdom, where the big red \u2018shrooms with white polka dots suggest a Wonderland designed for the Smurfs. Luigi gets dumped into the Dark Lands, a Tim Burton nightworld of gnarled trees and creepy chattering skeletons.\nMario just wants to rescue his brother, but then he meets Princess Peach (Anya Taylor-Joy), who rules over the Mushroom Kingdom\u2019s denizens, who have spherical mushroom heads and the faces of airbrushed babies; they\u2019re led by Toad (Keegan-Michael Key), a cuddlebug with attitude. Mario then teams up with Princess Peach to save her kingdom from Bowser, a fire-breathing beastie who commands a vast army of Koopas, who are turtles. Bowser is a turtle too, if a rather monstrous one \u2014 he\u2019s like a fusion of Lionel Barrymore, the Wayland Flowers puppet Madame, and, a T. Rex plushie made for toddlers.\nJack Black, who voices this horny demon, gives a stupendous performance. Bowser is in love with Princess Peach, even as he\u2019s planning to attack her empire, and Black, conjuring something very different from his usual hipster-stoner vibe, makes Bowser a domineering but deeply insecure romantic, like the Phantom of Opera as a neurotic troglodyte. Having a villain who\u2019s a vulnerable ogre you\u2019re at once appalled, amused, and fascinated by makes this a very different sort of kinetic kiddie fantasia. When Bowser is onscreen with his flaming red eyebrows and S&M arm bands, his gap-toothed reptile leer, his Meat Loaf-meets-Axl Rose soft-rock odes to Peach, and his nerd\u2019s megalomania, the audience is in heaven.\nThere\u2019s a way that mainstream animation, not to mention my own taste in it, has been evolving. So much of it has become rote, with an empty fractious dazzle that doesn\u2019t ultimately sustain interest. And the Pixar brand, much as it saddens me to say it, has in recent years lost some of its humanistic luster. The animated movies I\u2019ve been most drawn to have been off the Pixar grid \u2014 movies like \u201cTrolls\u201d and \u201cRalph Breaks the Internet,\u201d which merge a kind of kinetic virtuosity with an emotional flair that sneaks up on you. I\u2019d put \u201cThe Super Mario Bros. Movie\u201d in that camp. It\u2019s going to be a huge, huge hit, but not just because of its beloved gamer pedigree. (That didn\u2019t help \u201cSuper Mario Bros.\u201d in 1993.) It\u2019s because the movie, as directed by Aaron Horvath and Michael Jelenic (from a script by Matthew Fogel), is a serious blast, with a spark of enchantment \u2014 that je ne sais quoi fusion of speed and trickery, magic and sophistication, and sheer play that\u2026well, you feel it when you see it.\nThe key thing \u201cThe Super Mario Bros. Movie\u201d has that too many animated films don\u2019t \u2014 I would say, without overstating it, that it links the film to the spirit of \u201cYellow Submarine\u201d \u2014 is a rollicking aesthetic of transmutation. We know that Mario can balance on a girder to face off against Donkey Kong, even as Donkey Kong\u2019s dad, Cranky Kong (voiced by Fred Armisen with the kind of extreme New York accent that somehow feels right at home in the Jungle Kingdom), cheers for Mario\u2019s demise. But when Mario wins the duel by transforming himself into a cat, all because he is now wearing a furry cat costume, that\u2019s pure video-game surrealism. I change identity by tapping a Power-up box, therefore I am. The movie also strikes a note of agreeably transgressive comedy when Cranky Kong and his crew, who\u2019ve been placed in hanging cages, have to the endure the presence of a glowing star who voices Debbie Downer existential despair in the ickiest of baby voices.\nThere have been approximately 50 movies based on video games, and most of them are terrible. I\u2019ve had limited patience even for the ones that \u201cwork,\u201d like the coolly depersonalized \u201cResident Evil\u201d series or that first \u201cLara Croft\u201d film. It\u2019s not that I\u2019m hostile to video games; it\u2019s that the game and film mediums are so different. Then again, not all video games are the same \u2014 the funky nihilist hellscapes of Grand Theft Auto couldn\u2019t be further removed from the interactive innocence of the Mario franchise. Mario presides over a digital playground that lifts the spirit to a place of split-second wonder, and \u201cThe Super Mario Bros. Movie\u201d stays true to that. Its ingenuity is infectious. You don\u2019t have to be a Mario fan to respond to it, but the film is going to remind the millions who are why they call it a joystick.",

No pipes to fall down there are there? The first of many questions this film poses... Fans of classic computer games, no doubt\u00a0leave the big screen adaptations\u00a0of their favourite pixelated heroes wondering why it just doesn't work?\u00a0 Clearly there's something about\u00a0how the rules of cinema storytelling, just don't suit taking the imagery and POV\u00a0gamers\u00a0come to hold dear to their hearts. This gets lost in the transfer and the need to crowbar\u00a0extra narrative\u00a0in for the potential uninitiated\u00a0friends\u00a0and family of said fans, is often badly executed.\u00a0 Most cinema goers looking to enjoy this movie, most likely won't have a memory of the 1993 fantasy adventure flick starring Bob Hoskins and Dennis Hopper. Nor should they.\u00a0 Despite its best intentions, that film is best consigned to a category labelled: 'VHS era Friday night rental gone wrong, but you just had to watch it.' This animated entry into the Nintendo cinematic cannon is well executed from the\u00a0get go. Watching Mario and Luigi set up their own business, record a hilarious TV advert with bad Italian accents and get ribbed by their family, over a delightful dinner setting is magical.\u00a0 So is their entry into the games world the fans will recognise. Everything is great right up until we run into Donkey Kong, deftly voiced by stoner icon (and we presume Mario Kart game playing legend) Seth Rogen.  Their battle and trip on a speedy cart is a manic delight. But the film loses focus straight after this point. Jack Black's vocal turn as Bowser is criminally underused, given the run time of the movie.  Jack has one musical number, as Bowser fantasises\u00a0about winning the heart of the Princess. He's just misunderstood - like all villains after all.\u00a0 He is a perfect comedic foil to Chris Pratt's mellow fluid tones of Mario and they should share more screen time together.  This reviewer\u00a0had high hopes for this movie, given the strength\u00a0of the vocal cast and director\u00a0Aaron Horvath, who co-created the excellent Teen Titans Go! But sometimes a movie just can't equal the sum of all its parts.\u00a0 Sad, but true. The main problem is there just isn't enough of an engaging narrative to hold your attention\u00a0for the length of the movie.\u00a0 Apart\u00a0from setting the scene that Brooklyn plumber Mario and his brother fall down a pipe, whilst trying to save the city from a flood of epic proportions (is it related to what's happening in the land below?.. this is never explained)...\u00a0 Mario is pulled into an adventure to save a race of Mushrooms, ruled by a human Princess (how did she fall down a pipe as a baby, we just don't know?) He jumps in with a wild sense of duty and gusto which is hard to explain.  Apart from the fact that his younger, taller and more handsome brother Luigi is somewhere else in this nightmare and just might be able to be saved.\u00a0 So many questions!? Perhaps it's best just to leap in the air, eat a mini mushroom (are they sentient too? Surely like most fungi in fantasy lands they will be?)... Power Up and shout:\"let\u2019s-a-go!\" \"Mamma Mia!\" and \"It's a mee!\" In a bad Italian accent, likely to cause offence to a younger, politically correct audience of Millennials.\u00a0 If you're a fan of Mario or Nintendo games in general, you will get some enjoyment out of it. We'd love to hear your thoughts in the comments below. \u00a0 We watched this flick in the spacious and comfortable\u00a0surroundings of The Box and their ample sofas in FACT's independent cinema, on Wood Street, Liverpool.\u00a0 A perfect\u00a0place for soaking up filmic adventures. Our two young boys enjoyed having a sofa to themselves and being able to stretch out and feel like the space was just for them.

        "text": "Super Mario Bros. Movie review: not quite a super show, but a potent nostalgia tour\nThough this new cinematic outing isn\u2019t quite as tight as those given to Sonic and Pikachu, Illumination and Nintendo\u2019s partnership is resoundingly successful in dispelling Mario\u2019s 90s movie curse.\nIt\u2019s taken decades, but video game movies have finally come full circle with the release of The Super Mario Bros. Movie. It was 1993\u2019s Super Mario Bros. that kicked off Hollywood\u2019s regular flirtations with video game adaptations - and the same film in many ways came to represent the infamy that video game movies have enjoyed since. Put simply, it was rubbish - though also filled with imagery that would make it a quiet cult classic. Now, Nintendo has partnered with Illumination, the studio behind the Minions, to break the curse.\nBy many measures, The Super Mario Bros. Movie is successful. By others, it is much less so - but be rest assured that anybody saying that this film is \u2018as bad as\u2019 or even remotely comparable to its nineties cousin is talking hyperbolic rubbish. This movie is in a different area code. The question is, is it actually as good as its present peers? The world of cinematic gaming conversions is very different in 2023 than in the nineties; in fact, the competition is quite fierce.\nThe choice of Illumination is, well, illuminating. This is a studio that I\u2019d argue isn\u2019t really about the art in the way some others are- certainly not in the Scorsese sense, but even within the kids\u2019 space when compared to the likes of Pixar. In these stakes, I\u2019d even place them south of Dreamworks Animation. But what Illumination is extremely adept at is making films that press the buttons of audiences, especially the young, in the right ways. They\u2019re never particularly substantive, but they work. And such is the case for the Super Mario Bros. Movie.\nIt\u2019s a workmanlike storyline, which keeps the runtime brief for the little kids and the gag-time plentiful for everybody else. It\u2019s a familiar setup to the 1993 version, in fact - Mario and Luigi are New York plumbers, and after a good ten to fifteen minutes of their daily grind, events unfold that see them sucked down a warp pipe and spat out into the fantastical world we know from the games.\nIt\u2019s worth noting that despite being a long-time fan of the Mushroom Kingdom and its adjacent worlds, and deeply familiar with all of the games, this early stint is actually my favorite part of the movie. There\u2019s a fun little slapstick comedy of errors of a bathroom repair gone wrong, and a decent amount of characterization for Mario, Luigi, and surprisingly some of their extended family (but, before you get excited, no other familiar faces).\nIt\u2019s in this stretch also that the references flow thick-and-fast (Kid Icarus! An Arwing! Wrecking Crew! Punch-Out!), and also when the performances and characters get a small chance to shine. Everybody here is well cast, I think - even Chris Pratt, who came in for a lot of criticism off the back of the trailers but does a pretty good \u2018classic\u2019 Mario voice at the very start of the film before dropping the exaggerated flair for something more palatable for the lead of a 92-minute feature. I thought Jack Black\u2019s Bowser would be my peformance highlight - and he is great - but it\u2019s the quiet brotherly chemistry between Pratt\u2019s Mario and Charlie Day\u2019s Luigi that left the biggest impression.\nOnce in the Mushroom Kingdom, the adventure begins - but really, not much happens. Bowser is on the rampage, and Princess Peach must seek out and form an alliance with the Kong Kingdom - represented by Donkey, Kranky, and about a million Kong cameos - in order to survive. Mario and Luigi end up split up; Mario with Peach, Luigi trapped with the bad guys. The plot from the moment all of this established through to the end is a breadcrumb trail - and boy, those crumbs are vanishingly small. This\u2019ll likely work great for smaller kids, but the older viewers are the more likely they are to wish there were some more meat on these bones.\nBut this is an Illumination movie, and so minimalist as it is - it\u2019s always fun. There\u2019s a surprising adherence to the rules of the games that is uncommon in film adaptations - power-ups are a thing, and so too is the logic that if you get hit, you lose their bonus. Sometimes this risks backfiring - as a Mario player I understood the climax perfectly well, and was even hyped by it, but I reckon elements of it might fly over the heads of some.\nThe nostalgia hose is open on full-pelt though - and it\u2019s difficult to argue with its potency. Every frame is packed with references to the Mario and DK series, some more obscure than others. The glue that holds the film together is its score - and I\u2019d actually argue it is the single best piece of the movie.\nKojo Kondo\u2019s work on the Mario series is iconic, and this score by Brian Tyler (Expendables, Iron Man 3, Fast & Furious franchise) makes ample use of it. The score typically begins with a recognizable Mario theme, then quickly meanders off into something more original before staging a whiplash return to another classic theme. It\u2019s frenetic, it\u2019s wild\u2026 and wow, it works.\nIt\u2019s true that any film would be transformed, probably for the worse, if its score were removed or replaced with something more generic - imagine James Bond or Indiana Jones without the themes of Johns Barry or Williams. But it has to be said that the Mario score is clearly transformative on another level. I dare say without this piece of the puzzle, the movie might appear more vapid, and as more of a cynical paint-by-numbers cash-in. The score lifts up the whole piece, and the movie as a whole feels like a perfect tribute to Kondo\u2019s legend.\nFor me, the score sort of papers over the cracks. To compare with Mario\u2019s time-honored nemesis, the Sonic movies (and also Detective Pikachu) excited me by the way they make use of some of the franchise\u2019s iconic imagery - often in interesting and slightly surprising ways. There\u2019s little surprising in Mario, and little interesting about how its biggest iconography appears. They just appear, and you\u2019re asked to recognize them, and feel happy at the memory.\nBy the same token, Mario\u2019s humor is surprisingly rote and one-dimensional - which surprised me, given Illumination\u2019s comedy chops. In both instances one has to concede that this is a movie for children, obviously, but Sonic and Pokemon do show that there\u2019s another, more measured and effective way.\nBut perhaps the point is that when the Mario Movie does try to escape this, it begins to stall. Take the arrival at the King Kingdom, for instance. Despite the brisk pace of the adventure, it\u2019s clearly decided that at this point there\u2019s been too long between action scenes - so we have a labored section where an unnamed Kong drives Crazy Taxi style through Kong-land while A-Ha\u2019s \u2018Take on Me\u2019 blasts. It practically feels like it\u2019s fallen out of a different movie. There\u2019s a couple of moments like this, where the action begins to trend to the generic and your brain begins to drift.\nThe result, then, is a film that isn\u2019t perhaps as interesting or as brave as some of its peers - but it\u2019s perfectly enjoyable in its own right. For my money the crown remains somewhere between the Sonics and Detective Pikachu - with barely a cigarette paper to separate them - but Mario is just behind, nipping at the heels. And certainly, children will absolutely love it - this is going to do mega business.\nOh, and - if you\u2019re patient enough to stay after the credits... you may want to do so? There's two stingers - one after the main credits, and a second after the full roll. If you know your Mario, it\u2019s worth doing.",

        "text": "Illumination animation studio, the big brain behind the Despicable Me trilogy and the lesser brain behind the recent Minions: The Rise of Gru and ho-hum sequels to Sing and The Secret Life of Pets, turns in this serviceable adaptation of the beloved Nintendo franchise. It\u2019s the best outcome we could have hoped for: fun for kids; very okay for adults.\nIt is unfortunate that two directors and a screenwriter (Matthew Fogel) felt the need to shoehorn in an extended family and \u2013 groan \u2013 Oedipal crisis for both Mario and Donkey Kong. Despite this misstep, the film belts along with an assault of candy colours and a commendable command of canonical detail.\nRemember when, at the very nadir of video-game adaptations, Alicia Vikander\u2019s Tomb Raider hastily did something or other with shapes and colours during the final sequence of the 2018 film? Have no fear. Super Mario Bros, silly while leaning heavily into Mario Kart 8, buzzily incorporates the platform game that inspires it. Chase scenes and chapters lovingly re-create the sensation and pace of gameplay, a throwback to the golden age of New Games Journalism.\nThe plot, in other respects, is unlikely to be confused with Christopher Nolan\u2019s Memento. Mario (Chris Pratt) and Luigi (Charlie Day) are brothers running a new plumbing business in Brooklyn. A mysterious portal leads them to the Mushroom Kingdom, where Princess Peach (Anya Taylor-Joy) is about to be assailed (and wooed) by the tyrannical Bowser (Jack Black). Can Mario find his brother, save the kingdom and power up again and again? Well, sure.\nSome of the voice cast is, arguably, overfamiliar, but it\u2019s always a pleasure to encounter Black and Keegan-Michael Key. The ever-popular 1980s aesthetic \u2013 cue A-ha, Bonnie Tyler and an amusing faux-contemporaneous TV commercial \u2013 adds bounce and nostalgia for accompanying parents. Sensitive children beware: the PG rating stems from many barrel-related injuries.\nShout out to game designer Shigeru Miyamoto. There\u2019s something magical about being in a cinema full of nine-year-olds who are just as excited as this writer was for the same franchise at the same age. But we\u2019ll go to our graves disputing that blue-mushroom wear-off.",

        "text": "The Super Mario Bros Movie\u2026 how did it come to this, that I thought I\u2019d watch this in the cinema?\nWell, while looking to see what was out that weekend, Suzume was certainly of interest, but I like to double-bill when I can, and since this was showing on 300 of the screens in my local fleapit\u2026 yes, it was that time. Plus, it was on one of their biggest regular screens (screen 8).\nThere\u2019s a relatively short running time for this movie compared to most, at just 92 minutes in length, but there\u2019s still time for Bowser to make his presence felt early on, by forcing entry into the Snow Kingdom which, to my eyes, looked like it was ruled by Pingu and his family. Yes, I\u2019m not massively up on the lore\u2026 I love the 2D games in the series without thinking about them too much, but the 3D open-world entries leave me a bit cold.\nAn initial thought about the main characters, though, was: Isn\u2019t Chris Pratt (Thor: Love And Thunder) in too many movies? As Mario, he doesn\u2019t sound in the least bit Italian, and doesn\u2019t even bother to attempt the accent, unless it\u2019s a cursory, \u201cLet\u2019s-a-go!\u201d\nStill, to the tune of The Beastie Boys\u2019 No Sleep Till Brooklyn (since that\u2019s their home city), they set off to their first plumbing job, running along a building site \u2013 which is done in a similar style to the handheld Donkey Kong game I owned in 1983, and which was then broken by a so-called friend over the summer holidays who just washed his hands of the whole thing afterwards (why didn\u2019t I just punch him?), despite later ending up with another friend\u2019s handheld of the same game.\nOh, and if you\u2019re wondering whether this film included these lyrics from the song\u2026\n- # Trashing hotels like it\u2019s going out of style\nGetting paid along the way \u2019cause it\u2019s worth your while\nFour on the floor, Ad Rock\u2019s out the door\nMCA\u2019s in the back because he\u2019s skeezin\u2019 with a whore #\nIt did not.\nI then had another question: Why are they \u201cThe Super Mario Bros\u201d, when Mario is the first name of only one of them? Well, apparently, their surname is also Mario. So, Mario is Mario Mario! Erm\u2026 that doesn\u2019t make much sense. Reminds me of when I was at school and a geography book was written by Martin Martin. What sort of parents would do that to their kid?!\nBut no time for such trivialities, since to save the city, they go underground after trying to fix a water leak, even though, surely the local council would do all this? No private contractors would do that in reality.\nOn their way to the Mushroom Kingdom (it doesn\u2019t really matter how or why), Mario and Luigi (Charlie Day \u2013 I Want You Back) get separated, with Toad (Keegan-Michael Key \u2013 The Pentaverate) escorting the former to meet Princess Peach (Anya Taylor-Joy \u2013 The Menu), who teaches him about power-up mushrooms and how to use them, despite the fact he hates mushrooms. Personally, I\u2019m not a huge fan, since they don\u2019t really taste of anything, which seems a wasted opportunity by Mother Nature. Still, it\u2019s another chance to hear the cultural staple that is A-Ha\u2019s Take On Me during this scene. And it\u2019s a scene where Mario is trying a zillion ways to complete a particular course, which he finds as tough as I\u2019m currently finding Bunker II in Goldeneye 007 on Xbox Game Pass. Damn, that\u2019s a hard level!\nAnother important question: Since Princess Peach has an incredibly tight butt, she could have the pick of any eligible young batchelor, so why would she waste her time on hairy Mario Mario?\nAnd as an aside, since Bowser is played by Jack Black (Jumanji: Welcome To The Jungle), he gets a chance to sing about Princess Peach and how he wants to make her his wife. Come on, love, you can do better!\nOverall, The Super Mario Bros Movie has nice visuals to rival a sugary sweet overdose, but such a lazy script which is entirely plotless rubbish. Still, we\u2019ll get at least one more movie, since this has taken a fortune at the box-office. It cost $100m to make, and since its released two weeks ago, it\u2019s taken $710m worldwide.\nAs such, it\u2019s unfortunate for Dungeons and Dragons: Honour Among Thieves, which was much better, yet will have suffered by being a family movie that was released just one week prior to this, so will go by largely ignored, and thus, is unlikely to get a sequel, although apparently a TV series spin-off is being planned. That could work better given the amount of content to explore within the D&D world.\nThis 2023 outing also comes out thirty years after the much-derided Super Mario Bros movie from 1993. Sure, that was bad (albeit not as much as this), but there\u2019s a brilliant hour-long extra on the Blu-ray, during which directors Rocky Morton and Annabel Jankel tell how the original script was a darker version than the one which ended up onscreen, along with all the problems they faced in trying to bring their vision to the screen.

        "text": "The Super Mario Bros. Movie, 2023.\nDirected by Aaron Horvath and Michael Jelenic.\nFeaturing the voice talents of Chris Pratt, Anya Taylor-Joy, Charlie Day, Jack Black, Keegan-Michael Key, Seth Rogen, Fred Armisen, Kevin Michael Richardson, Sebastian Maniscalco, Charles Martinet, Khary Payton, Eric Bauza, Jessica DiCicco, Jeannie Elias, and Juliet Jelenic.\nSYNOPSIS:\nWhile working underground to fix a water main, Brooklyn plumbers\u2014and brothers\u2014Mario and Luigi are transported down a mysterious pipe and wander into a magical new world. But when the brothers are separated, Mario embarks on an epic quest to find Luigi.\nIt is disappointing that The Super Mario Bros. Movie, the big-screen animated adaptation of a videogame franchise that has been at the forefront of platforming innovation and endearing simplicity, has not only been reduced and molded to fit the unambitious and lackadaisical Illumination brand (Minions garbage) but is also this generic and soulless.\nThe Super Mario Bros. Movie speed runs through as much fan service as possible, warping through several locations and set piece ideas without ever establishing them appealingly through storytelling or visual splendor. There\u2019s a point where the many iconic Super Mario Bros. characters decide that their best chance at saving the Mushroom Kingdom involves racing to a certain ambush point using go-karts, except it comes off as less of a plot point and more of a desperate, placating plea of \u201clook, we are giving you Rainbow Road, although we have no idea what the hell to do with it besides render some pretty colors!\u201d.\nNothing is impressive about seeing how much of an image can be filled with easter eggs, inside jokes, and fan service. Directors Aaron Horvath and Michael Jelenic (working from a screenplay by Matthew Fogel, based on characters and dozens of games created by Shigeru Miyamoto and others at Nintendo, including one of the all-time great video game score composers in Koji Kondo who has had many of his tunes here arranged into overly serious, nostalgia-bait cringe) all fall into the trap of amassing a treasure trove\u2019s worth of elements people love about everything Super Maro Bros., but no firm grasp or understanding on how to weave them into an experience that also feels like those games.\nThere\u2019s an early scene in Brooklyn where Italian sibling plumbers Mario and Luigi (voiced by Chris Pratt and Charlie Day in harmless but unremarkable performances) rush to a fixer-upper gig, where the race across the city takes on a side-scrolling tracking shot perspective replete with hopping. It\u2019s one of very few visually impressive segments. Still, it also works because, for once, the film is allowing itself to embrace its gaming origins proudly. Mario and Luigi are also such iconic characters that wasting 10 or 15 minutes depicting their plumbing lives to either ground them into the real world or explain who they are is pointless.\nThis comes after The Super Mario Bros. Movie begins relatively fine, introducing the villainous spiked oversized turtle Bowser (impressively voiced by Jack Black, especially during his amusingly obsessive moments over making Princess Peach his wife, but more on her soon), his discovery of a magical Super Star, and his plans to overthrow the Mushroom Kingdom. It\u2019s simple, effective storytelling fitting of an adaptation of games that primarily have no plot other than stomping on enemies\u2019 heads in an effort to rescue a princess.\nThe first sign of trouble is when the filmmakers choose to interrupt the flow of that opening sequence with some licensed music, which turns out to be a repeated offense (with so many questionable song choices). Once Mario and Luigi are properly established as struggling workers not exactly making their parents (voiced by Charles Martinet, the longtime voiceover actor for Mario in the games) proud, they find themselves sucked into another world and separated; Mario ends up in the Mushroom Kingdom whereas Luigi finds himself inside the more hostile environments and eventually kidnapped by Bowser and his shelled troops. Cue the corny story about how they can do anything when they are united.\nFar more frustrating is that The Super Mario Bros. Movie constantly feels the need to explain plot elements, characters, areas, and power-up mechanics rather than just showing the audience (an audience that most likely knows how all of this works, whether they are familiar with the games or not. from cultural osmosis) and constructing extended platforming segments. Too much of the movie consists of familiar chase sequences and action structuring to be found in similarly basic animated features. Anytime the film introduces a theoretically exciting aspect from one of the games, it squanders that opportunistic potential.\nNevertheless, Mario is taken to Princess Peach (voiced by Anya Taylor-Joy as a girl power stereotype), who is apparently not human and has mysterious origins that are presumably left to be further explained in sequels, where she enlists him to win the favor of the Kong army for battling Bowser and his minions. Meanwhile, Seth Rogen pops into voice the hotheaded and destructive Donkey Kong, although it\u2019s a disappointing turn as it feels like he is playing himself. There\u2019s obviously not much of a character to latch on to. Still, here more than anyone else, the star-studded celebrity cast comes across as a detriment, favoring star power over unique personality.\nOddly enough, Chris Pratt and Charlie Day are fine, although the latter is probably made out to be a bit too dimwitted. Solid voiceover performances inside, nothing about this tale of brothers down on their luck transforms into anything remotely emotionally satisfying. This is only a problem because the movie is bafflingly going for that. Jack Black is the only one that shines, switching between a terrorizing leader and a delusional incel singing silly melodies about marrying Princess Peach and how her hatred of him only increases his affection for her. No one will want The Super Mario Bros. Movie as much as Bowser desires Princess Peach.\nFlickering Myth Rating \u2013 Film: \u2605 \u2605 / Movie: \u2605 \u2605\nRobert Kojder is a member of the Chicago Film Critics Association and the Critics Choice Association.

        "text": "\u201cThe Super Mario Bros. Movie is a visually stunning animated adventure film that, unfortunately, suffers from several notable pacing and casting issues.\u201d\n- Visually stunning animation throughout\n- Several memorable set pieces\n- An unrelentingly fast pace\n- A weak first act\n- Uneven comedy throughout\nIt\u2019s fitting, in a way, that The Super Mario Bros. Movie feels so much like a side-scrolling, 2D video game. Not only are there multiple instances throughout the 92-minute film in which directors Aaron Horvath and Michael Jelenic literally adopt a side-scrolling perspective, but the film also bounces from one story beat and location to another with the same sense of dimensionless expediency. Penned by Matthew Fogel, The Super Mario Bros. Movie doesn\u2019t want to spend too much time exploring its locations or characters \u2014 no matter how beautifully they\u2019re rendered. The film, instead, feels like it\u2019s being operated by a competitive gamer who wants to progress through each level as quickly as they can.\nThat doesn\u2019t mean The Super Mario Bros. Movie is without its pleasures. Animated by the artists at Illumination (the studio responsible for Despicable Me and Minions), The Super Mario Bros. Movie is a visually sumptuous film from beginning to end. Every frame feels carefully and lovingly polished (Rainbow Road has, perhaps, never looked better). The film\u2019s script, direction, and voice performances, unfortunately, fail to evoke the same level of care and commitment. The resulting film is, like all the most disappointing video games, technically impressive but flavorless and dramatically unengaging.\nThe Super Mario Bros. Movie wisely introduces its villain, the nefarious Bowser (Jack Black), before its heroes. The film\u2019s opening scene follows Bowser just as he and his army of evil turtles launch an all-out assault on a kingdom of peaceful penguins in order to capture their coveted Super Star. Bowser\u2019s attack rides the line between epic danger and comedy well, but his acquisition of the penguins\u2019 Super Star plays out, like much of The Super Mario Bros. Movie, far too quickly to make much of an impact.\nFrom there, the film cuts to \u2014 of all places \u2014 Brooklyn, New York, where a pair of Italian brothers, Mario (Chris Pratt) and Luigi (Charlie Day), are in the midst of trying to launch their new, family-run plumbing company. Despite their clear passion, however, both Mario and Luigi meet resistance and mockery from some of their closest family members and their former employer, Spike (Sebastian Maniscalco). Desperate to prove himself, Mario leads Luigi one night on a mission to fix a broken Brooklyn water main. After a series of unexpected events leads them into a hidden chamber in the New York City tunnel system, though, Mario and Luigi find themselves sucked into a magical green pipe that leads to other worlds.\nAlong the way, Mario and Luigi get separated from each other. The latter ends up a prisoner of Black\u2019s Bowser in the \u201cDark Lands,\u201d while Pratt\u2019s Mario finds himself stranded in the Mushroom Kingdom, which is ruled by the formidable Princess Peach (Anya Taylor-Joy). Upon learning about Luigi\u2019s situation, Peach lets Mario and his companion, Toad (Keegan-Michael Key), join her on her journey to convince the Mushroom Kingdom\u2019s neighboring Kong army to join them in their crusade to defeat Bowser once and for all. Little does Peach know that Bowser not only wants to conquer the multiverse but also turn Peach into his bride.\nPeach, Mario, and Toad\u2019s adventure features a fair number of memorable moments, but The Super Mario Bros. Movie\u2019s lean 92-minute runtime forces it to speed through all of its plot beats at such a breakneck pace that many of them are rendered weightless. That aspect of the film is made worse by its decision to spend a large portion of its first act exploring Mario and Luigi\u2019s unexciting lives in Brooklyn. On paper, that might not seem like a terrible idea, but Mario and Luigi\u2019s origin story ultimately doesn\u2019t add much to The Super Mario Bros. Movie. As a matter of fact, it delays the film from getting to its more exciting fantasy worlds and set pieces and, consequently, forces The Super Mario Bros. Movie to compensate for its New York detour by only speeding even faster through its second and third acts.\nThe film\u2019s performances are, much like its story, a bit of a mixed bag. While Chris Pratt\u2019s voice isn\u2019t nearly as irritating as some of The Super Mario Bros. Movie\u2019s trailers may have suggested, he still feels miscast throughout the film as Mario. The same goes for Seth Rogen as Donkey Kong and Fred Armisen as Cranky Kong, the crotchety father of Rogen\u2019s himbo gorilla. Rogen brings little to his performance except his usual on-screen persona \u2014 rendering Donkey Kong as just yet another one of his stoner characters. Armisen, on the other hand, takes a big vocal swing as Cranky Kong that doesn\u2019t totally connect, which results in a vocal performance that isn\u2019t funny as much as it is purely grating.\nSome of the film\u2019s other cast members fare better. Anya Taylor-Joy makes Princess Peach a likable warrior by turning in a fairly committed, if low-key, performance. Charlie Day, conversely, gives a performance as Luigi that rides the line between cartoonish and human well, while Juliet Jelenic steals several scenes as the joyfully nihilistic Lumalee. No one, however, makes quite as lasting of an impression as Black, who brings his usual, over-the-top energy to Bowser, an insecure warlord who can suddenly bust out a pathetic power ballad about his undying love for Peach as easily as he can blast a deadly ray of fire from his mouth.\nAs rushed as it is, The Super Mario Bros. Movie does make space for several visually stunning and genuinely thrilling action sequences. A Super Smash Bros.-esque arena fight between Pratt\u2019s Mario and Rogen\u2019s Donkey Kong lands particularly well, though, no sequence in the film is quite as gorgeous or engaging as the Mario Kart-inspired race down Rainbow Road that caps off its second act. As much as it is an instance of blatant nostalgia bait, the set piece is so visually engaging and propulsively paced that it\u2019s impossible not to wish that the rest of The Super Mario Bros. Movie had felt as cohesive, fun, and gripping.\nThere is clearly a lot of love for its source material on display throughout The Super Mario Bros. Movie. The film makes more than a few efforts to pay homage to all the corners of the Mario Bros. video game franchise, but not all of them work as well as others, and even the film\u2019s best scenes are hampered by its frustratingly breathless pace and sporadically effective comedic moments. As is the case with its selection of \u201880s needle drops, which include now overly used tracks like \u201cHolding Out for a Hero\u201d and \u201cTake On Me,\u201d the film is an aesthetically pleasing but unimaginative romp.\nThe Super Mario Bros. Movie is now playing in theaters. Be sure to read The Super Mario Bros.

        "text": "The Super Mario Bros. Movie has proven more controversial than you would think a kids\u2019 film about a loveable Italian plumber would be. Before anyone had ever seen Super Mario Bros, it drew ire and raised eyebrows. People are very precious about the things they loved in childhood, and Super Mario Bros is perhaps the most beloved video game of all time. It already had an infamously bad adaptation in 1993, and the seemingly random casting of the very un-Italian Chris Pratt as Mario himself seemed bizarre.\nThey really didn\u2019t need to worry. This animated adventure is silly, earnest fun. A quick reminder of the story: two plucky Brooklyn brothers who run a plumbing business become the ultimate heroes of the Mushroom Kingdom by defeating the world-conquering evil turtle Bowser. Most of us know the narrative beats. And that\u2019s the point: Hollywood is obsessed with existing IP.\nDispensing with the comedy Italian accents (except for as a bit), Mario (Chris Pratt, an unlikely but serviceable choice) and Luigi (Charlie Day of It\u2019s Always Sunny fame, giving a zany undertone to proceedings) are broke, underestimated by their loud Italian-American family, and looking for plumbing gigs.\nThen, the brothers fall through a suspiciously bright green pipe and into the fantasia we recognise from the games \u2013 animated with colourful verve and deep fidelity to Nintendo aesthetics. They meet Peach (Anya Taylor-Joy), a princess more than capable of helping herself out of trouble, and team up to fight a heavy metal-loving Bowser (a highly amusing Jack Black).\nRefreshingly, the film is light on adult-friendly jokes and wink-nod moments, bar some 80s needle-drops to signal the game\u2019s arcade origins and a running gag about Mario hating the taste of mushrooms. It\u2019s unapologetically a film for children, with nothing to frighten little ones too much, except for the odd skeleton Koopa and some lava flow.\nThere are some great little visual nods to the internal logic of the gameplay: a character sitting on a Koopa shell, forcing it to ping back and forth in familiar fashion, or the sudden deployment of a game \u201c1-up\u201d (Mario\u2019s yellow cat-suit, for example, or Peach\u2019s fire flower outfit change) at a key moment in battle. It keeps things fresh and funny, and although the writing often does little but flimsily prop up the setpieces (\u201cThat\u2019s how you princess,\u201d Toad exclaims at one point, in a prime example of eye-rolling dialogue choices), the screenplay does the job it should, providing light chuckles of recognition throughout.\nPandering to audience recognition may be a huge portion of Super Mario Bros\u2019 enjoyment, but it is animated with flair and sprinkled with a few fun ideas of its own. Without overplaying its hand, it hits all the major notes within the wild, inventive universe of block-breaking and Goomba-stomping.",

        "text": "The Super Mario Bros. Movie Review: Great Graphics Hide Uninspired Gameplay\nThe Super Mario Bros. Movie fixes Hollywood's original sin in the eyes of Nintendo and will be adored by children. But for such a beautifully made product, it's strangely hollow on the inside.\nThe shadow of the original Super Mario Bros. movie circa 1993 is strong. As one of the first video game movies, the picture had for a brief time the likes of Dustin Hoffman, Tom Hanks, and Arnold Schwarzenegger circling key roles. The stink we now usually associate with \u201cvideo game movies\u201d was not yet a thing. Of course that stench really began because of Super Mario Bros. and its status as a legendary Hollywood disaster. The scent became so overwhelming, in fact, not to mention humiliating, that Nintendo lowered the gates to their kingdom, refusing to let Hollywood enter again for a full 30 years.\nThree decades later though, the gates are up, the drawbridge is down, and Universal Pictures and Illumination Entertainment have convinced Nintendo to hand them the keys. Which makes it striking that in many ways, The Super Mario Bros. Movie (2023) appears to be a course correction; a redo; a veritable Sliding Doors scenario where the setup is pretty much the same thing: Two Brooklyn-born brothers of unconvincing Italian-American heritage are down on their luck as plumbers until they stumble onto a portal to another dimension hidden beneath the sewers of NYC. Only now that portal is the more familiar green pipe from the games instead of bizarre (but also game-based) inter-dimensional quicksand. More importantly, however, once the Brothers Mario pass through that gateway, they avoid winding up in a garish, allegedly kid-friendly version of Blade Runner. Instead they\u2019re at last in the giddy beauty and vast wonderment of the Mario games. For audiences nine to (probably) 49, it should be overwhelming.\nIf the notoriously cinema-shy Nintendo was hesitant to ever do this dance again for fear of seeing their prized intellectual property not faithfully adapted, they and millions of fans (particularly children), can rest easy. Super Mario Bros. The Movie is an exhaustingly slavish recreation of elements from the games. Few will likely even notice, either, that it\u2019s by way of a pretty generic and fairly hollow Illumination flick.\nTo be sure, the thing certainly looks grand after Mario (Chris Pratt) follows Luigi (Charlie Day) down the pipe-shaped rabbit hole. Before that moment, there is some basic backstory revealing the pair are viewed as a couple of mustachioed losers by their family and the neighborhood, and Mario just wants to do something important (meanwhile Luigi just wants to do whatever Mario wants). But once they leave their slice of Kansas behind, Luigi is pretty much sidelined for the whole movie because he lands in the Dark Lands, where he is captured by the Koopa armies of Bower (Jack Black), a tyrannical dragon with an underrated singing voice.\nConversely, Mario lands in the Mushroom Kingdom, which is populated by an endless sea of androgynous children, each named Toad (Keegan-Michael Key voices the most important one), and the humanoid Princess Peach (Anya Taylor-Joy). But make no mistake, this Peach is nobody\u2019s damsel. Before Mario tastes even his first mushroom, the Princess is already a badass jumper, fireball-wielder, and Rainbow Road driver. It\u2019s honestly a bit of a mystery why the princess has need of plumbers at all, especially one as schlubby as Pratt\u2019s Mario. The movie doesn\u2019t seem to really consider that question either. They meet and she agrees immediately to take him with her to the Jungle Kingdom where she will entreat with the father of Donkey Kong (Seth Rogen) to join her forces in a fight against Bowser before the Koopa King invades both of their lands.\nThis movie is, again, a visually sumptuous transfer of Nintendo iconography to a 70-foot (or so) screen. And it\u2019s all here: mushrooms that turn Mario into a giant? Check. Leaves that inexplicably make him a raccoon with the gift of flight? Double check. That white top hat Bowser wore during select cutscenes of Super Mario Odyssey? Look, the easiest way to sum up an easter egg guide for this sucker is to say that if you can think of it, it\u2019s probably in the movie and it\u2019ll put a smile on your face when it appears (including via two post-credits scenes).\nYet it isn\u2019t just the simple name or visual recognition that works in the film\u2019s favor. For the first time in what seems like nearly a decade, Illumination is really stretching its animation prowess to its fullest. Historically, Illumination films after the early surprise success of Despicable Me have excessively relied on celebrity stunt voice casting and tedious pop culture jokes and songs \u201cfor the adults,\u201d which are intended to paper over thin narratives.\nOne must really give credit where it\u2019s due to The Super Mario Bros. Movie then; the attention to detail (and likely pressure to please the rightsholders of what has grown into a billion-dollar IP) is immense. As a result, parents and children alike will overdose on the sugar rush blast of candy-colored nostalgia on constant display. Peach\u2019s Castle at the top of the Mushroom Kingdom, Bowser\u2019s Flying Fortress, Rainbow Road, even the spooky trees from Luigi\u2019s Mansion are all gorgeously recreated, and each further enhanced by Brian Tyler score, which sprinkles in countless nods to Nintendo games of yore and their beloved themes written by Koji Kondo.\nYet the limit to that AAA effort is it\u2019s still in service to a movie that is shackled by the far more limited imagination of Illumination formula. As far as Twitter gossip is concerned that begins and ends with the stunt casting of Pratt as Mario. And truthfully it is unnecessary, especially when Charles Martinet, who has voiced Mario and Luigi in the games since 1996, makes a vocal cameo that is instantly beguiling. However, Pratt is more than fine as the Italian plumber in a red cap. It\u2019s not a remarkable performance per se, but it fulfills the limited demands set by Illumination\u2019s film.\nAnd what those demands consist of is another American animated film that coasts off audience recognition of IP and fourth-wall breaking gags. It\u2019s been 20 years, nearly to the day, since Quentin Tarantino made HOTEI\u2019s \u201cBattle Without Honor or Humanity\u201d the audible sound of cool in Kill Bill: Vol. 1, and when it appears inside of the first 90 seconds of The Super Mario Bros. Movie, parents will instantly know it\u2019s lost all cultural cachet and relevance. Of course kids, who will be this movie\u2019s best served audience, won\u2019t care, nor should they. Nevertheless, I wonder if ripping off the nearly as old Shrek 2 by sliding in Bonnie Tyler\u2019s \u201cI Need a Hero\u201d for a montage will go as unnoticed by even the youngest viewers.\nAnd that\u2019s really the thing about this movie. As a carefully calibrated stewardship of a game franchise that multiple generations love, the handling is nothing short of a door-to-door white glove service\u2014and a far cry from that American insult in \u201893. As an actual animated movie that needs to stand on its own, however, it\u2019s derivative and barebones. The quiet scenes between Mario and Peach feel particularly strung together with seeming character beats and lines of dialogue that were probably storyboarded missing after the story was condensed during the animation process.\nThere are exceptions of course, most of them regarding Black inside Bowser\u2019s Castle. In the one instance where the celebrity casting actually adds to the quality of the film, Black\u2019s King Koopa is reimagined as a lovelorn and sensitive soul, prone to tearful power ballads on the piano. One can\u2019t help but wonder how much of that is improvised by Black\u2014just as one might wonder what a Mario Bros. movie might\u2019ve been like if it was made by Pixar or even the newly revitalized DreamWorks Animation that just put out Puss in Boots: The Last Wish.\nAs it stands, this is a cute family film that children will adore, and many nostalgic adults will drift away on like a magic carpet above a 64-bit flying pirate ship. It\u2019s an adequate product with exquisite craftsmanship. When you open it up though, it\u2019s empty on the inside.\nThe Super Mario Bros. Movie opens Wednesday, April 5.",
